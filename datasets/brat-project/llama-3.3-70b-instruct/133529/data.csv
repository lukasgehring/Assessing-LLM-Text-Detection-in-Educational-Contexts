0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;The age-old debate about whether to teach children the value of competition or cooperation has significant implications for their character development and future contributions to society. In my opinion, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial, as it helps them develop into well-rounded individuals who can work effectively in a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected.On the one hand, competition can be a powerful motivator, instilling in children a sense of ambition and drive. It encourages them to set goals, strive for excellence, and develop the resilience to bounce back from setbacks. However, an overemphasis on competition can have negative consequences, such as increased anxiety, unhealthy rivalries, and a lack of teamwork skills. When children are solely focused on outdoing their peers, they may overlook valuable opportunities for personal growth that come from sharing ideas and listening to others.On the other hand, teaching children to cooperate fosters essential social skills like empathy, communication, and conflict resolution. In today's fast-paced world, the ability to work effectively in diverse teams is crucial. Cooperative learning environments allow children to gain different perspectives, nurturing their emotional intelligence and social awareness. These skills are essential not only in personal relationships but also in professional settings, where teamwork is key to success.Furthermore, cooperation promotes a sense of community and belonging among children, which is vital for their emotional well-being. Collaborative experiences can foster friendships and create supportive environments where children feel valued and understood. In conclusion, while competition has its benefits in promoting individual achievement, prioritizing cooperation provides a stronger foundation for developing socially responsible adults. By teaching children to work together harmoniously, we prepare them to thrive in a world that relies increasingly on collaboration and mutual support. Ultimately, cooperation is the key to raising a generation of empathetic, communicative, and socially aware individuals who can make a positive impact in their personal and professional lives.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;The surge in migration in today's society has sparked a wide range of opinions on how best to integrate and adapt to new cultures. Although assimilation into the adopted country is crucial, the idea that immigrants must completely relinquish their cultural heritage is debatable. I propose that a balanced approach, where immigrants can preserve their cultural identity while embracing local customs, is the most advantageous for both individuals and the broader society.Primarily, the exchange of cultures enriches societies. Immigrants introduce unique customs, viewpoints, and experiences that can enhance the social fabric of their new communities. For example, the culinary diversity brought by immigrants can create a more vibrant cultural landscape. When immigrants retain elements of their heritage, they contribute to a multicultural environment that promotes understanding and acceptance among diverse groups, ultimately fortifying social bonds.Furthermore, the pressure to abandon one's cultural roots can lead to feelings of isolation. Many immigrants encounter challenges such as nostalgia for their homeland and discrimination. Forcing them to discard their past can exacerbate these problems, resulting in a lack of connection within their new community. By permitting immigrants to maintain their customs while adapting to local norms, society can create an inclusive atmosphere where all individuals feel valued.Moreover, adapting to local customs is essential for practical reasons, including effective communication and social cohesion. Mastering the language, comprehending societal norms, and respecting local traditions can facilitate smoother integration and enhance relationships with local citizens. This adaptation does not necessitate the loss of one's own identity, but rather an evolution of it, allowing for mutual respect and understanding.In conclusion, while acknowledging the necessity for immigrants to adapt to their new surroundings, I firmly believe that they should not be compelled to abandon their cultural heritage entirely. A harmonious blend of cultural preservation and adaptation fosters a more inclusive and diverse society, ultimately benefiting all parties involved.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;The rise of international tourism has been a notable phenomenon in recent years, driven by technological advancements, improved accessibility, and a globalized economy. This trend has sparked a range of opinions on its effects on societies, cultures, and economies. In my view, the benefits of international tourism outweigh its drawbacks, particularly in its ability to facilitate cultural exchange and drive economic growth.A significant advantage of international tourism is its role in promoting cultural exchange. Visitors from abroad bring with them unique customs, traditions, and viewpoints, providing local communities with the opportunity to engage with diverse cultures. This enriches the lives of local residents and fosters greater understanding and tolerance among people from different backgrounds. For instance, the influx of tourists can lead to exhibitions of art, music, and cuisine that introduce locals to international influences, thereby enhancing the cultural diversity of tourist destinations.Furthermore, international tourism plays a vital role in economic development. Many countries heavily rely on tourism as a primary income source, generating substantial revenue annually. This influx creates jobs in sectors like hospitality, transportation, and retail, contributing to local economies and lowering unemployment rates. Additionally, tourism incentivizes investment in infrastructure such as roads, airports, and amenities, which benefits both visitors and local residents alike.On the other hand, critics of international tourism often point to concerns about environmental degradation, overcrowding in tourist areas, and the commercialization of local cultures. These concerns are legitimate and deserve consideration. However, with appropriate management and sustainable tourism practices, the negative impacts of tourism can be minimized.In conclusion, while the negative effects of international tourism should not be ignored, its potential to foster cultural exchange and strengthen economies is undeniable. By adopting a responsible approach to international tourism, we can foster a world that values diversity and prospers economically.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;The rapid growth of international tourism in recent years has been unparalleled, with its presence now more pronounced than ever before. This phenomenon has sparked a heated debate about its effects on countries and local communities, with both favorable and unfavorable consequences being discussed. In my view, the advantages of international tourism surpass its disadvantages, offering opportunities for cultural exchange, economic expansion, and heightened global awareness.A significant benefit of international tourism is the substantial economic stimulus it provides to host nations. The tourism industry generates substantial revenue, creates employment opportunities, and boosts local economies. Nations endowed with rich cultural heritage and natural beauty, such as Thailand, Italy, and Costa Rica, heavily rely on tourism to support their economic frameworks. The influx of foreign currency can lead to improved public services, enhanced infrastructure, and social development. Communities that welcome international tourists often experience revitalization, with thriving businesses and local artisans gaining broader recognition.Moreover, international tourism facilitates cultural exchange and understanding. As individuals travel to foreign countries, they immerse themselves in diverse customs, traditions, and ways of life. This cross-cultural interaction enriches their experiences, broadens their perspectives, and awakens appreciation for global diversity, contributing to greater tolerance and respect among nations. In an era where globalization is often viewed with skepticism, tourism acts as a bridge that connects individuals from diverse backgrounds.However, it is crucial to recognize the potential drawbacks of mass tourism, including environmental degradation, cultural homogenization, and strain on local communities. Popular tourist destinations can become overcrowded, leading to the exploitation of natural resources and affecting residents' quality of life. To address these challenges, responsible tourism initiatives are vital, emphasizing sustainability and respect for local cultures.In conclusion, while international tourism presents certain challenges, its overall impact is predominantly positive. By driving economic development and fostering cultural understanding, international tourism plays a vital role in shaping our increasingly interconnected world. With the adoption of sustainable practices and mindful travel, we can harness its benefits while mitigating its drawbacks.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;The idea of studying abroad is undeniably thrilling for many students, as it promises exposure to new cultures, enhanced academic prospects, and a chance to gain independence. Nevertheless, I believe that the difficulties of adapting to a foreign culture and environment can outweigh the benefits of studying overseas, making it more advantageous for many students to study closer to home.A significant challenge that international students face is adapting to a new culture. Being immersed in an unfamiliar environment, students often encounter difficulties such as language barriers, unfamiliar social norms, and different educational methods, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and homesickness. The strain of adapting to a new environment can negatively impact the educational experience, hindering academic performance and personal growth.Moreover, the financial implications of studying abroad are substantial. International tuition fees are typically higher than those for domestic students, and additional expenses such as travel, accommodation, and living costs can be overwhelming. For many families, these financial burdens can compromise the quality of education a student receives, as financial stress can distract from studies and diminish the overall university experience.On the other hand, studying locally offers students the benefits of familiarity and a support system. Being close to family and friends can provide emotional stability during the challenging transition to higher education. Local universities can also provide quality education and valuable networks that can lead to good job prospects, all without the added challenges of adjusting to a foreign culture.In conclusion, although studying abroad offers unique opportunities for personal growth and development, the challenges associated with cultural adaptation, financial strain, and emotional support suggest that studying locally may be a more beneficial option for many students. Ultimately, the decision to study abroad or locally should be made carefully, taking into account individual circumstances and aspirations.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;In recent years, studying abroad has emerged as a highly sought-after option for numerous students. The decision to pursue an education outside of one's native country is influenced by a multitude of factors, each offering distinctive personal, academic, and professional benefits.One of the primary motivations for students to study abroad is the chance to experience diverse cultures. By immersing themselves in a new and unfamiliar environment, students can acquire a more comprehensive understanding of the world. This cultural exchange facilitates personal growth, promotes open-mindedness and adaptability, and aids in the development of essential life skills. For instance, the everyday challenges of navigating a foreign country demand effective problem-solving and communication skills, which are essential in today's interconnected world.Another significant reason students opt to study abroad is to gain access to superior quality education and specialized programs that may not be available in their home countries. Foreign institutions often boast acclaimed academic programs, state-of-the-art resources, and distinguished faculty members. For example, a student from a developing nation may choose to pursue studies in engineering or technology in a country renowned for its innovation in these fields, thereby enhancing their academic credentials and future job prospects.Furthermore, studying abroad offers invaluable opportunities for networking. Students can establish connections with peers, academics, and industry professionals from varied backgrounds, which can potentially lead to internship and job opportunities in the future. These international networks are crucial in a global job market, where employers increasingly place a high value on cross-cultural competencies.Lastly, personal development is a substantial motivator for studying abroad. Living away from home prompts students to become more self-sufficient and independent, often culminating in a more mature outlook on life. Overcoming the challenges of a new environment prepares students for future endeavors, both on a personal and professional level.In conclusion, the reasons behind students' decisions to study abroad are multifaceted, including cultural immersion, access to quality education, networking opportunities, and personal growth. These experiences not only enrich their educational pursuits but also equip them with skills and perspectives that shape their future endeavors, rendering the international educational experience exceedingly valuable.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The rise of the internet has dramatically changed the way people consume information, leading many to believe that traditional newspapers are on the decline. However, it's too simplistic to assume that newspapers will become outdated, as this overlooks several important factors.One of the key advantages of the internet is the speed and ease of access to news. Online news sources, including websites, blogs, and social media, provide up-to-the-minute updates and instant access to global news. This is particularly appealing to younger audiences, who are used to getting news and information quickly and easily. Additionally, online news sources often offer interactive features, such as videos and comment sections, which enhance reader engagement in ways that print newspapers cannot.Despite the benefits of online news, traditional newspapers still have a lot to offer. Many people trust and rely on newspapers for credible and reliable information, which can be hard to find online. In-depth reporting, investigative journalism, and well-researched articles are still mainly found in print media, which is often held to high editorial standards. This commitment to quality journalism attracts readers who are looking for trustworthy information and nuanced perspectives.Furthermore, newspapers play a vital role in local communities. Local journalism, often provided through print media, covers important regional issues that matter to residents. Unlike online algorithms that favor broader topics and sensational news, local newspapers are essential for community engagement and accountability.In summary, while the internet has significantly changed the way news is shared and consumed, it's too simplistic to say that newspapers are no longer relevant. Their unique contributions to credible journalism and community-focused reporting continue to resonate with readers, ensuring that the essence of news will endure, even if the medium evolves.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";The allocation of a government's budget between early childhood education and universities is a crucial decision that has far-reaching implications for a country's long-term growth and development. Prioritizing early childhood education can have a significant impact on both individual and societal progress, yielding substantial benefits that can be felt for years to come.The early years of a child's life are a critical period for cognitive, emotional, and social development, with research consistently demonstrating that high-quality early childhood education is a key determinant of future success. By investing in early education, governments can lay the foundation for improved literacy and numeracy rates, reduced dropout rates, and a more skilled and capable workforce. This, in turn, can have a positive impact on the overall quality of life and the economy.An added advantage of prioritizing early childhood education is its cost-effectiveness. By addressing educational disparities at a young age, governments can reduce the need for costly remedial programs later on, resulting in significant long-term savings. Quality preschool programs, for instance, can prevent the need for expensive interventions down the line, making them a wise investment.That being said, the importance of higher education should not be overlooked. Universities are essential for fostering innovation, leadership, and advanced skills, all of which are vital for a country's progress and competitiveness. Therefore, a balanced approach, where governments allocate funds to both early childhood initiatives and higher education institutions, is the most effective strategy. This dual-focus approach will ensure a comprehensive educational ecosystem that prepares citizens for all stages of life and equips them with the skills and knowledge necessary to contribute to their nation's prosperity and sustainability.In conclusion, prioritizing early childhood education is a sound strategy for driving long-term development, but it is crucial that this is complemented by sufficient funding for universities. By adopting a dual-focus approach, governments can ensure that future generations are well-equipped to drive innovation, leadership, and growth, ultimately contributing to a more prosperous and sustainable future.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";Living with roommates is a crucial part of student life in both school and university environments. The quality of a roommate can have a significant impact on a student's academic success and mental health. Therefore, it's vital to identify the key qualities that make a roommate relationship successful. Among these qualities are respect, effective communication, and a willingness to share responsibilities.The most important quality of a good roommate is respect. Since individuals come from diverse backgrounds and have unique lifestyles and study habits, a respectful roommate acknowledges and accommodates these differences. This means being considerate of the other person's space, belongings, and routines. For instance, if one roommate needs a quiet environment to study while the other likes to listen to music, a respectful roommate will find a compromise, such as using headphones or establishing quiet hours. This mutual respect creates a positive living environment and minimizes potential conflicts.Effective communication is another vital quality of a good roommate. Open and honest communication helps prevent misunderstandings and promotes a harmonious living situation. If one roommate is struggling with schoolwork or personal issues, a supportive roommate will create a safe space to discuss these concerns. Regular communication can help address potential problems before they escalate, ensuring both roommates feel heard and valued. This open dialogue helps build trust and strengthens the roommate relationship.Lastly, sharing responsibilities is essential for a successful roommate relationship. When roommates divide chores such as cleaning, grocery shopping, and paying bills, it fosters a sense of teamwork and fairness. For example, if one roommate consistently takes out the trash while the other does the dishes, it ensures that both individuals contribute equally to maintaining a comfortable and functional living environment. Failing to share responsibilities can lead to resentment and conflict, which can negatively impact both personal and academic life.In conclusion, respect, effective communication, and a willingness to share responsibilities are essential qualities of a good roommate. These traits help create a supportive and positive living environment that enhances the overall college experience, allowing students to succeed both academically and personally.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;The ongoing discussion about whether governments should focus on upgrading roads and highways or on advancing public transportation is a critical concern in numerous urban centers globally. Although both are vital for a society's functioning, I argue that governments should give precedence to investing in public transportation.A key argument for prioritizing public transportation is its capacity to alleviate traffic congestion. As urban populations grow, the number of vehicles on the roads increases exponentially, resulting in substantial traffic jams. By enhancing public transit systems, such as buses, trains, and subways, governments can offer practical alternatives to driving, thereby easing overall traffic and reducing travel times for all. A well-developed public transportation network incentivizes the use of shared transportation over individual vehicles, ultimately decreasing the number of cars on the road.Furthermore, investing in public transportation yields environmental advantages. The proliferation of roads and highways contributes to pollution due to emissions from the vast number of vehicles. By promoting the use of public transit, governments can encourage sustainable travel options that minimize individual carbon footprints. Efficient public transportation systems can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus addressing climate change and improving air quality in urban areas.Moreover, improving public transit can foster greater social equity. Many individuals, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds, rely on public transportation to access employment, education, and essential services. Well-maintained and efficient transit systems can empower these communities by connecting them to opportunities, thereby contributing to economic mobility and reducing social disparities.In conclusion, while both road infrastructure and public transportation necessitate investment, the priority should be given to enhancing public transit. The benefits of reduced traffic congestion, environmental sustainability, and social equality highlight the importance of governments investing in effective public transportation systems for the betterment of society as a whole.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";The discussion about whether physical exercise should be a compulsory part of the school day or if students should focus exclusively on academic pursuits is crucial in determining the quality of a well-rounded education. In my opinion, physical exercise is essential in schools due to its numerous benefits for students' physical health, mental well-being, and overall academic achievement.To begin with, physical exercise is vital for maintaining students' physical health. In a time when sedentary lifestyles are becoming more common, regular physical activity in schools can help combat obesity and related health problems. By participating in organized activities like sports, yoga, or basic exercises, students develop habits that promote long-term health and fitness. This foundation of physical fitness encourages students to lead active lives, thereby reducing the risk of chronic diseases in adulthood.Moreover, physical exercise has a significant impact on enhancing students' mental health. Research has consistently shown a strong link between physical activity and improved mood, reduced anxiety, and enhanced cognitive function. Exercise stimulates the brain to release endorphins, which can reduce stress and improve concentration. This increased mental clarity can lead to better academic performance, as students are more focused and engaged in their studies. Therefore, incorporating physical exercise into the school day can effectively complement academic learning.Additionally, physical exercise provides students with valuable life skills that may not be covered in traditional academic subjects. Participating in team sports and group activities teaches students important lessons in teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. These qualities are essential as they prepare students for the challenges of higher education and the competitive job market.In summary, incorporating physical exercise into the school curriculum is vital. It promotes physical health, enhances mental well-being, and equips students with essential life skills. A comprehensive education should prioritize both academic and physical development, preparing students for long-term success in all areas of their lives.
11;Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the telephone have changed the way that nations interact with each other in a global society. Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.;The modern world has been profoundly impacted by advancements in transportation and communication, leading to a significant shift in the way nations interact with one another. One of the most influential technological innovations in this regard is the Internet, which has had a profound impact on global society. It has altered the way nations communicate, conduct business, and engage in diplomatic efforts.One of the key benefits of the Internet is its ability to bridge geographical gaps, enabling instantaneous communication between individuals and organizations regardless of their physical location. This has facilitated real-time dialogue, which is essential in today's fast-paced global environment. As a result, nations are no longer isolated, and can engage in discussions and negotiations without being constrained by time zones or physical barriers. The proliferation of virtual summits and international conferences is a prime example of this, allowing global leaders to collaborate on pressing issues such as climate change and public health crises in a swift and efficient manner.Furthermore, the Internet has revolutionized global trade and commerce. The emergence of e-commerce platforms has opened up new markets, allowing small businesses in developing countries to connect with customers worldwide. This has democratized trade, fostering economic growth and creating new opportunities that were previously unavailable. As a result, nations are becoming increasingly integrated into a global economy, where collaboration and competition coexist in a dynamic marketplace, driving innovation and improving consumer choices.The Internet has also redefined the practice of diplomacy, with social media platforms playing a significant role in shaping public opinion. Leaders are now using platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to communicate directly with citizens and global audiences, promoting transparency and accountability. However, this can also undermine diplomatic efforts if not managed carefully, highlighting the Internet's complex and multifaceted influence.In conclusion, the Internet plays a vital role in modern international relations, influencing communication, commerce, and diplomacy. Its capacity to facilitate connections and enable rapid information exchange underscores its importance in shaping a global society where collaboration is both necessary and inevitable. As technological advancements continue to evolve, the Internet is likely to remain a crucial component of international relations, reflecting the increasingly interconnected nature of the global community.
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;The current discussion about the impact of technology on children's creativity presents compelling arguments on both sides. Nevertheless, I argue that technology does not inherently stifle children's creativity, but rather, it has altered the manner in which they express it.Firstly, technology offers children an array of tools and resources that were previously unimaginable. Digital platforms, including social media, video editing software, and digital art applications, provide novel mediums for creative expression. For example, children can now effortlessly combine music, art, and storytelling, and share their creations with a global audience. This exposure encourages them to think beyond traditional creative boundaries, resulting in innovative forms of self-expression that were previously nonexistent. The interaction with diverse cultures and ideas facilitated by these platforms fosters an environment conducive to thriving creativity.Furthermore, numerous educational applications and online platforms promote creative thinking and problem-solving skills. Interactive games and software that encourage exploration and experimentation can stimulate children's imagination. For instance, programs that involve coding not only teach logical thinking but also offer a platform for children to create their own games, animations, or applications, thereby blending creativity and technology. This synergy inspires a new generation of inventive thinkers.However, it is crucial to recognize that an overreliance on technology can lead to passive consumption, rather than active engagement in creative pursuits. Excessive screen time can distract from hands-on activities, such as drawing, building, or outdoor play, which are essential for cultivating imagination. Therefore, the challenge lies in striking a balance between technology integration and traditional creative activities in children's lives.In conclusion, technology has redefined and broadened the scope of creativity, rather than diminishing it. By judiciously utilizing these tools, parents and educators can tap into the potential of technology to foster creativity in children, preparing them for an increasingly digital world.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;In today's educational landscape, the importance of teachers as knowledge facilitators is often overshadowed by the abundance of alternative learning resources, such as the internet and television. Nevertheless, I argue that while these resources offer valuable supplementary information, the unique benefits of teacher-delivered lessons are essential for a well-rounded learning experience.One of the primary advantages of teachers is the wealth of personal experience and expertise they bring to the classroom. Unlike static online resources, teachers can provide nuanced explanations, real-life examples, and interactive discussions that help students grasp complex concepts more effectively. Moreover, teachers can adapt their teaching methods to suit different learning styles, whereas online sources often present information in a uniform manner that may not engage every student.Moreover, the learning environment created by teachers fosters critical thinking, engagement, and intellectual exploration in ways that passive consumption of information cannot. Through class discussions, collaborative projects, and hands-on activities, students are encouraged to explore ideas, ask questions, and challenge assumptions, thereby deepening their understanding and developing crucial skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. In contrast, online resources like videos and articles often lack the interactive element that promotes deeper intellectual engagement.Another significant role of teachers is that of mentors and role models. They offer emotional support, guidance, and motivation, which can substantially impact a student's confidence and academic performance. The mentor-student relationship establishes a trust-based environment where students feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and concerns, an aspect that is difficult to replicate in online learning settings.In conclusion, while alternative sources of information provide valuable insights and supplementary knowledge, the comprehensive learning experience provided by teachers is unparalleled. The combination of expertise, interactive learning, and mentorship that teachers offer equips students with the necessary tools to succeed not only academically but also in navigating life's challenges beyond the classroom. Therefore, I firmly believe that learning from teachers holds a vital place in education, and their role should not be underestimated in the face of alternative learning sources.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;The emergence of email and text messaging has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we communicate, opening up new channels for connection and interaction that were previously unimaginable. Nevertheless, this technological shift has also sparked concerns about the potential decline of written language. Although it is true that these modern forms of communication can pose challenges to traditional language norms, the notion that they significantly imperil the state of written language warrants a more detailed analysis.On the one hand, the concise and informal nature of text messaging and emails has led to the widespread use of abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons. This transformation has fundamentally changed the way people use language, often promoting a more relaxed style that may compromise grammatical conventions and spelling accuracy. For example, the ease of texting has caused many individuals to rely on shortened expressions, which may deteriorate literacy skills among younger generations who are still developing their traditional writing skills.On the other hand, it can be argued that these modern communication methods facilitate language evolution rather than pose a threat. The diverse range of formats emerging from texting and emailing, such as memes, GIFs, and visual storytelling, reflects a dynamic and evolving linguistic landscape. Moreover, the instant nature of these communications fosters immediacy and spontaneity, enabling real-time engagement that traditional written language often lacks.The relationship between technology and language is, in many ways, symbiotic. Email and text messaging may have altered the context in which written communication takes place, but they have also revitalized interest in language through their innovative formats. Notably, many individuals still engage in formal and high-standard writing when necessary, indicating that written language has not been entirely compromised.In conclusion, while the rise of email and text messaging has presented challenges to traditional writing standards, it has also introduced opportunities for language evolution and diversity. Therefore, rather than perceiving these technologies as a significant threat, we should acknowledge their capacity to enrich and adapt the way we communicate.
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";The use of animals for human benefit has long been a topic of heated debate, with strong arguments on both sides. Some argue that utilizing animals is justified if it meets human needs, particularly in areas like research, agriculture, and entertainment. They claim that animal testing has led to significant medical breakthroughs, saving countless lives, and that domesticating animals for food and labor has been crucial to human survival and progress throughout history. This viewpoint is based on the belief that humans have a higher moral status, which allows for the exploitation of animals when it yields substantial benefits for society.On the other hand, there are compelling arguments against exploiting animals, which focus on moral and ethical concerns. Critics of animal use argue that such practices violate the rights of sentient beings capable of feeling pain and suffering. They advocate for a more compassionate approach, arguing that animals have inherent value and deserve respect and protection, regardless of their usefulness to humans. The growing trend towards recognizing animal rights is reflected in various campaigns and movements promoting vegetarianism and veganism.In my view, while some animal use may be necessary and beneficial, it is crucial that it is carried out ethically and with strict regulations. Scientific and medical advancements should not come at the expense of animal welfare. With alternatives like synthetic testing and plant-based products becoming increasingly viable, we should strive to minimize animal exploitation and prioritize humane treatment. Rather than outright exploitation, a balanced approach that maximizes benefits while minimizing harm is necessary for a just society. This approach acknowledges the potential benefits of animal use while ensuring that they are achieved in a way that respects and protects animal welfare.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;The notion that television has destroyed communication among friends and family is a claim that warrants closer inspection. Although excessive TV consumption can lead to a decline in face-to-face interactions, it is an overstatement to assert that television has irreparably damaged communication. On the contrary, TV can be a valuable medium for fostering dialogue and connections among loved ones.One of the primary ways television achieves this is by providing a shared experience that can serve as a conversation starter. For example, watching popular TV shows together can give friends and family members a common topic to discuss, ranging from plot developments and character arcs to overarching themes. These discussions can lead to a deeper understanding of one another's thoughts, emotions, and perspectives, thereby enriching the communicative atmosphere within households.Furthermore, television has become a potent platform for raising awareness about critical social issues. Through documentaries and programs, it often sparks conversations around pressing topics such as environmental conservation, mental wellness, and social equality. These discussions can lead to informed and empathetic dialogue, promoting a sense of shared responsibility and deeper connections among viewers.It is essential, however, to recognize the potential downside of excessive television viewing, particularly when it results in social isolation. This, nonetheless, is a matter of maintaining balance and moderation rather than an intrinsic flaw of television itself. By setting limits on screen time, families and friends can ensure that television viewing does not replace quality time spent interacting with each other.In summary, while television has the potential to detract from communication, it also has the power to enhance connections and stimulate meaningful conversations. Rather than perceiving it as a destroyer of communication, it is more accurate to view television as a tool that, when utilized wisely, can enrich relationships among friends and family.
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;The discussion around gender representation in universities has undergone significant changes in recent years, with a growing demand for institutions to implement policies that promote gender equality in student admissions. However, the idea of universities accepting an equal number of male and female students in every subject requires careful consideration. While achieving gender parity in education is crucial, enforcing a strict quota system could compromise the principles of academic merit and individual choice.On the one hand, promoting equal representation can help break down traditional gender stereotypes in fields where one gender is overrepresented. For example, fields like engineering and technology have historically been dominated by men, while nursing and education have typically attracted more women. By striving for balanced admissions, universities can create a more inclusive environment that encourages diverse perspectives and innovation across all disciplines. This approach also supports societal goals of achieving gender equality, enabling women to succeed in areas where they have been underrepresented.On the other hand, enforcing strict numerical equality may inadvertently undermine the principle of meritocracy. Ideally, students should be admitted based on their qualifications, skills, and passion for the subject, rather than their gender. Implementing equal admissions numbers could harm highly motivated and talented students, ultimately detracting from the quality of education. Moreover, imposing quotas may overlook the complexity of individual choices and aspirations, leading to a potentially adversarial and counterproductive academic environment.In conclusion, while pursuing gender equity in university admissions is commendable, enforcing equal numbers of male and female students in every subject may not be the most effective strategy. Instead, emphasizing a commitment to gender equity through supportive programs, scholarships, and outreach initiatives may better serve the interests of both individuals and society, promoting inclusivity without compromising academic integrity.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;The period of transition from adolescence to adulthood is a crucial phase in a young person's life, filled with decisions that will determine their future trajectory. One of the most significant choices they will make is whether to establish independence from their parents or continue living with them for an extended period. Although both options have their advantages, I firmly believe that attaining independence at the earliest opportunity is the most beneficial choice for young adults.Primarily, embracing independence promotes self-discovery and personal development. When young adults venture out on their own and take charge of their lives, they are forced to acquire essential life skills such as managing finances, making informed decisions, and resolving problems. These experiences foster resilience, confidence, and prepare them to navigate the complexities of adulthood. The challenges of independent living encourage individuals to adapt and evolve, which can lead to a more defined sense of identity and enhanced emotional maturity.Moreover, independence cultivates a sense of responsibility. When young adults are accountable for their own living arrangements, they learn to prioritize their responsibilities, including bill payments and household maintenance. This sense of accountability can instill a strong work ethic and discipline, which are invaluable in both personal and professional spheres. Additionally, independence often leads to more substantial and reciprocal relationships with parents, as the adult child transitions from dependence to a partnership grounded in mutual respect and support.On the other hand, residing with parents for an extended period can contribute to a prolonged state of immaturity. Young adults may rely excessively on their families for financial and emotional support, which can hinder the development of essential life skills and impede their transition to adulthood.In conclusion, while living with family for an extended period may offer comfort and security, the advantages of seeking independence early on, including personal growth, responsibility, and maturity, far surpass the comforts of living with parents. Therefore, young adults should strive to attain independence as a vital step towards realizing their full potential.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;The discussion about who is responsible for cleaning up the environment has become more intense as the consequences of climate change and pollution become more apparent. Some people think the government should take the lead in restoring the environment, while others believe that companies and individuals should be responsible. However, I think that while the government plays a vital role, it is necessary for individuals and corporations to work together to protect the environment effectively.There are several reasons why the government is crucial in this effort. Firstly, governments have the power to create and enforce rules, access to funds, and the authority to undertake large-scale environmental cleanup projects. They can use public money to fund projects that aim to restore natural systems, reduce emissions, and promote sustainable practices. Moreover, governments can enforce environmental laws and regulations that force companies to minimize their harm to the environment. For example, policies such as taxes on carbon emissions and strict waste management rules encourage companies to adopt environmentally friendly practices.Nevertheless, relying only on governments is not enough. Companies, particularly those that use a lot of resources, have a significant impact on the deterioration of the environment. Therefore, they must take responsibility for their activities and find innovative ways to reduce their ecological footprint. By adopting socially responsible practices such as using cleaner technologies, reducing waste, and ensuring sustainable supply chains, companies can create a positive impact that promotes a culture of environmental protection.Furthermore, individuals play a crucial role in preserving the environment. Community-based movements and public engagement can drive significant change. When individuals adopt sustainable habits such as recycling, saving water, and using public transportation, they contribute to a broad-based effort to address environmental issues. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can inspire collective action and motivate others to prioritize environmental sustainability.In conclusion, while the government has a primary role in enforcing regulations and funding environmental initiatives, the role of companies and individuals is equally important. A collaborative approach that combines the efforts of all stakeholders is essential for effective environmental cleanup and the promotion of a sustainable future. Only through shared responsibility can we tackle the urgent environmental challenges of our time.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;The role of advertisement strategies in driving sales and generating consumer interest is undeniable in today's marketplace. While effective advertising can significantly enhance product visibility and appeal, it is not the only factor that influences high sales. I largely agree that good advertisement strategies are vital for achieving high sales, but I also believe that other factors play a significant role.A well-planned and well-executed advertising campaign can establish a strong brand identity and capture the attention of the target audience. Companies like Apple and Nike are prime examples of this, using innovative marketing techniques that incorporate emotional appeal and storytelling to turn their products into cultural phenomena. Such advertisements go beyond simply informing consumers about a product, instead creating an aspirational narrative that encourages purchases.However, the importance of product quality and customer satisfaction cannot be overstated. Ultimately, it is often the product itself that drives sales. Even the most effective advertisements cannot sustain high sales in the long term if a product fails to meet consumer expectations. Factors such as consumer reviews, word-of-mouth recommendations, and overall product performance are crucial in building customer loyalty and prompting repeat purchases.Additionally, pricing strategies and distribution channels have a significant impact on sales. For instance, a product that is overpriced may deter potential buyers, regardless of how effective the advertisement is. Similarly, making a product easily available through various distribution channels ensures that consumers can readily purchase it, which in turn influences sales.In conclusion, while effective advertisement strategies are undoubtedly crucial for maximizing sales, they are just one piece of a larger puzzle. A successful marketing strategy must also consider product quality, pricing, and distribution to achieve lasting success in the competitive marketplace. Therefore, while I acknowledge the significant contribution of effective advertising to sales, it is essential to recognize the multifaceted nature of the factors involved and adopt a holistic approach to marketing.
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";The discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of a large number of young people attending university has sparked significant interest. Those in favor of university education argue that it is crucial for economic growth, innovation, and social advancement. They believe that a well-educated workforce is necessary for productivity and competitiveness in a global economy. By acquiring specialized skills and knowledge, university-educated young people contribute to the development of cutting-edge industries and technologies, thereby increasing a nation's growth potential. Furthermore, universities often facilitate innovation by providing a platform for students to engage in research and entrepreneurial activities that can lead to economically significant breakthroughs.However, critics counter that a surge in university enrollment can lead to a glut of graduates in fields with limited job opportunities, resulting in a saturated job market. This issue is particularly pronounced in regions where the labor market is unable to absorb the growing number of degree holders. As a consequence, many graduates face underemployment or work in jobs that do not require a university degree, leading to increased youth unemployment rates and concerns about the return on investment for individuals with substantial student debt and limited job prospects. Additionally, the focus on university education may divert attention from vocational training and apprenticeships, which are equally vital for a balanced economy.In my view, while a high university attendance rate among young people can bring significant benefits to a country, it is crucial to achieve a balance. Education systems should offer diverse pathways, including vocational training and apprenticeships, to ensure that all young people have access to rewarding career opportunities. By adopting this approach, countries can tap into the potential of their youth while avoiding the pitfalls of unemployment and underemployment.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;"The omnipresence of mobile phones in modern life has brought about unprecedented convenience and connectivity. Nonetheless, their pervasive use has also given rise to a multitude of social, health, and technical issues that necessitate thoughtful consideration.On a social level, mobile phones have contributed to a decline in direct human interactions. As people become increasingly absorbed in their devices, face-to-face communication dwindles, leading to an erosion of social skills. This can put a strain on relationships, as the quality of time spent with others is diminished when individuals are distracted by their screens. Furthermore, mobile phones can facilitate online harassment and exacerbate mental health problems, particularly among younger users who may feel pressured by social media expectations.From a health perspective, excessive mobile phone use has been linked to a range of medical concerns. A notable issue is the emergence of ""text neck,"" a condition stemming from poor posture when gazing at devices for prolonged periods. Additionally, extended screen time can cause eye strain and disrupt sleep patterns, as the blue light emitted from screens hinders melatonin production. Ongoing debates surround the potential long-term effects of mobile phone radiation, although conclusive evidence remains elusive.From a technical standpoint, the reliance on mobile phones has sparked concerns about privacy and security. The vast amounts of personal data stored on smartphones render them vulnerable to cyberattacks, resulting in identity theft and breaches of sensitive information. Moreover, the increasing dependence on mobile technology can create weaknesses in critical infrastructure, as systems rely on mobile connectivity for functionality and communication.When evaluating the drawbacks of mobile phone use against their benefits, it becomes apparent that while mobile phones enhance communication, convenience, and access to information, the accompanying social, health, and technical challenges cannot be disregarded. Finding a balance between leveraging the benefits of mobile phones and mitigating their adverse effects is essential for a healthier, more cohesive society. Therefore, the problems, although significant, can be managed through responsible mobile phone use and heightened awareness."
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;The widespread use of computers in today's digital age has become an integral part of daily life, impacting both adults and children alike. Although there are undeniable benefits to using computers, I strongly believe that the drawbacks of computer use among children often overshadow the advantages.One of the primary concerns is the potential health risks associated with excessive computer use. Prolonged screen time can lead to a range of health issues, including obesity, poor posture, eye strain, and sleep disturbances, all of which can hinder a child's overall development and well-being. Children who spend extensive periods in front of screens are more likely to develop these conditions, which can have long-term consequences.In addition to health concerns, the social implications of frequent computer use are also troubling. Heavy computer use can result in reduced face-to-face interaction among children, stunting their social skills and emotional intelligence. Relying too heavily on virtual communication can lead to difficulties in forming meaningful relationships, resulting in increased feelings of loneliness and isolation. This detachment from real-life social interactions can have lasting negative effects on a child's ability to navigate social situations in the future.Another significant drawback is the potential exposure to inappropriate online content. The internet contains a vast array of material that is not suitable for children, including violent images and cyberbullying. Without proper supervision, children can easily access harmful content that can negatively impact their mental health and worldview.While it is true that computers offer educational resources and opportunities for skills development, these benefits can often be achieved through limited and controlled exposure. Encouraging a balanced approach to technology, where children engage in a variety of activities beyond screen time, can promote healthier habits. By prioritizing alternative activities and regulating computer use, parents can help ensure their children's development is well-rounded.In summary, although computers have their benefits, the negative consequences of daily computer use among children are more significant. It is essential for parents to monitor and limit computer use, and to prioritize enriching activities that promote balanced development and overall well-being.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;The construction of a large factory in close proximity to a residential area can have a dual impact, resulting in both benefits and drawbacks that significantly influence the local ecosystem and the daily lives of its inhabitants.On one hand, the expansion of industry can yield considerable economic advantages. The introduction of a new factory is likely to generate a multitude of employment opportunities, ranging from production line workers to management positions, thereby decreasing local unemployment rates. This surge in job availability can stimulate economic expansion, culminating in increased disposable income for residents, who may subsequently spend more within their community, thereby supporting local enterprises and services. Moreover, factories frequently contribute to the enhancement of local infrastructure, including improved roadways and public transportation systems, which can elevate the overall quality of life.On the other hand, these advantages are accompanied by several negative consequences that can affect the well-being of the community. A primary concern is the environmental footprint. Factories can lead to increased contamination, encompassing air and water pollutants, which pose health risks to the public and local ecosystems. The noise emanating from machinery can also disrupt the serenity of the community, contributing to stress levels and potentially diminishing property values. Additionally, rapid industrial growth can strain local resources, such as water and energy supplies, potentially resulting in conflicts over resource allocation.From a social perspective, the presence of a large factory can create divisions within the community. While certain individuals benefit from employment opportunities, others may feel disenfranchised if they do not share in these benefits. This disparity can foster animosity and social tension, altering community relationships.In summary, although the establishment of a large factory near a community can yield economic benefits and development, it also poses substantial challenges, particularly with regards to environmental degradation and social cohesion. A balanced strategy, incorporating active community participation and sustainable practices, is crucial to mitigate these disadvantages and ensure the factory functions as a positive entity within the community.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;The art of cooking has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, driven by technological advancements and shifting societal values. The rise of pre-packaged meals and user-friendly kitchen gadgets has revolutionized the culinary world, making food preparation remarkably easier. However, this increased convenience also prompts important questions about its effects on our health, cultural heritage, and lifestyle.On the one hand, the simplicity of meal preparation has made cooking accessible to people of all skill levels, enabling them to create delicious dishes with minimal effort. Busy individuals and families can benefit from time-saving options that fit their hectic schedules. The emergence of meal kits, which provide pre-measured ingredients and easy-to-follow instructions, has enabled anyone to enjoy homemade meals without the hassle of planning and grocery shopping. This trend could lead to healthier eating habits, as families may opt to prepare meals at home instead of relying on fast food or take-out.On the other hand, the widespread availability of convenience foods has its downsides. Many pre-packaged meals are high in preservatives, sodium, and unhealthy fats, which can lead to negative health consequences in the long run. Furthermore, the reliance on easy-to-prepare options can erode culinary skills and knowledge, particularly among younger generations. Cooking is not just a practical skill, but also a vital part of our cultural identity, fostering creativity, family bonds, and an appreciation for diverse cuisines. As food preparation becomes less demanding, there is a risk that people will lose touch with these essential aspects of gastronomy.In conclusion, while the ease of food preparation can lead to healthier choices and save time, it is crucial to strike a balance between convenience and nutritional awareness, as well as cultural appreciation. By emphasizing cooking as both a life skill and an art form, we can ensure that society benefits from modern conveniences without compromising health and tradition. Ultimately, it is essential to critically examine the relationship between ease and the quality of our food experience to foster a healthier future.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;"The notion that financial aid is the sole and most effective means of supporting developing countries is a topic of debate that warrants a thoughtful examination. Although financial assistance is a vital component in the development of poorer nations, it is not a standalone solution.Financial aid undoubtedly provides immediate benefits, facilitating projects in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, all of which are essential for development. In times of crisis, such as natural disasters or pandemics, international aid has proven to be crucial. This financial support enables developing countries to stabilize their economies, reduce poverty, and invest in vital services.However, a sole reliance on financial aid has notable limitations. It can create a cycle of dependency that hinders self-sufficiency and innovation at the local level. Moreover, not all financial aid is effective, as issues like mismanagement, corruption, or the failure to address the underlying causes of poverty can render aid ineffective. Without adequate governance and accountability, funds may not reach their intended recipients or may be completely misdirected.A more comprehensive approach to assistance would involve combining financial aid with initiatives aimed at building capacity, transferring technology, and facilitating trade. Investments in areas such as education, infrastructure, and governance reforms can promote long-term growth and empowerment. By strengthening local economies and institutions, developing countries can build resilience and decrease their reliance on external aid.In summary, while financial aid is a significant tool for assisting developing countries, it is not the only solution. A multifaceted strategy that incorporates financial aid alongside other development initiatives, including education, governance, and infrastructure improvements, is crucial for achieving sustainable progress. Therefore, I partially concur with the statement; financial aid is crucial, but it needs to be supplemented with other forms of support to truly empower developing nations."
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;The debate surrounding the role of advertising in society is highly polarized, with passionate arguments on both sides. Some argue that advertising has no real value and causes harm, and therefore, should be completely banned. However, I believe that this issue is more complex and multifaceted. A total ban on advertising would not only be unrealistic, but also fail to acknowledge the important functions it can fulfill.On the one hand, advertising plays a vital role in keeping consumers informed. In today's fast-paced world, where choices are abundant, advertisements provide essential information about products and services, enabling consumers to make well-informed decisions. Advertisements highlight new products, facilitate comparisons between different offerings, and often foster competition among brands, resulting in higher quality and more affordable products for consumers. By promoting a well-informed marketplace, advertising serves a legitimate purpose that should not be dismissed.On the other hand, it is undeniable that advertising can have negative consequences. Certain types of advertising, especially those targeting children or promoting unhealthy products, can lead to undesirable societal outcomes, such as unhealthy lifestyle choices or the perpetuation of unrealistic beauty standards. Moreover, some advertising tactics can manipulate emotions, resulting in impulsive buying behaviors and a consumerist mindset that prioritizes material possessions over more sustainable values.Rather than advocating for a complete ban on advertising, a more nuanced approach would involve introducing stricter regulations to minimize its negative effects while preserving its beneficial aspects. Governments and regulatory agencies can establish guidelines that safeguard vulnerable groups, such as children, and encourage positive messaging related to health and wellness.In conclusion, although there are legitimate concerns about the quality and impact of advertising, a blanket ban would overlook its crucial role in modern commerce. Instead, society should aim to establish a framework that promotes responsible advertising, fostering a marketplace that benefits consumers while reducing potential harm.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;The modern landscape of gender roles has undergone a significant transformation, providing women with a multitude of opportunities previously unavailable to them. The debate surrounding whether women should prioritize careers or domestic duties sparks a range of opinions, but it's essential to strike a balance between these perspectives rather than adhering to a strict binary.Traditionally, women were confined to domestic duties, as their primary roles were those of caregivers and homemakers. However, with the advancement of education and the evolution of the workforce, women now have the opportunity to excel in various professional fields, thereby contributing to the economy and society as a whole. This shift is vital, as it empowers women and enables families to benefit from dual incomes, enhancing their financial stability and independence. Furthermore, the representation of women in various sectors challenges traditional gender norms, inspiring future generations to pursue their aspirations without restrictions based on gender.On the other hand, the notion that women should primarily focus on domestic responsibilities is rooted in cultural and societal expectations that persist in many communities. Although caring for and maintaining a household is undeniably valuable, this viewpoint may underestimate the potential of women to contribute to both their families and the workforce. Many women successfully balance both roles, demonstrating their resilience and multifaceted capabilities.Ultimately, the discussion surrounding whether women should work or focus on domestic duties is not about making a choice between the two, but about recognizing the right of women to make choices that align with their lives and aspirations. Encouraging equal opportunities enables women to thrive in both domestic and professional settings, leading to a more balanced and progressive society. Every woman's journey is unique, and the emphasis should be on providing flexibility and support for their choices, paving the way for a future where women can fully embrace all aspects of life.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";The debate about whether the government should cover the costs of university education, while primary and secondary education remains free, is a highly disputed issue in education policy. Although there are valid arguments on both sides, I generally support the idea that students or their families should contribute to the costs of university education.Firstly, primary and secondary education is a basic right and a crucial foundation for societal advancement. It is vital for creating informed citizens and plays a key role in reducing social inequality. In contrast, university education, although important, tends to benefit individuals in more specific and diverse ways. University graduates often secure better-paying jobs, making them more capable of bearing some of the financial burdens associated with their higher education. This aligns with the principle of personal responsibility, which suggests that individuals should invest in their own future, as education is a significant factor in career progression.Furthermore, making students or their families contribute to university education costs can increase the perceived value of a degree. When individuals invest their own resources, such as tuition fees or living expenses, they are more likely to approach their education with greater dedication and seriousness. This financial responsibility also teaches students important life skills that go beyond academic knowledge.However, it is essential to take into account the socioeconomic factors involved. Many students may face financial obstacles that limit their access to higher education, leading to a wider gap between the privileged and the underprivileged. Therefore, while I support a system where students or families contribute to university costs, this should be accompanied by strong scholarship and financial aid programs that ensure education remains accessible to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic background.In summary, the government should undoubtedly fund primary and secondary education, but a shared responsibility for funding university education is reasonable. This approach encourages personal investment in one's future while addressing the persistent financial inequalities in society.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;The history of automobiles in the UK, which began with the introduction of the first car in 1888, has undergone a significant transformation, revolutionizing the way society functions. By the turn of the millennium, it was estimated that there could be as many as 29 million vehicles on British roads, highlighting crucial concerns about sustainability, environmental degradation, and urban traffic congestion. Given these challenges, I strongly believe that promoting alternative transportation methods and implementing international regulations to govern car ownership and usage are necessary steps.The widespread use of vehicles is a major contributor to air pollution and climate change, with the internal combustion engine being a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions that drive global warming. Encouraging the use of alternative transportation methods, such as cycling, walking, and using public transport, can help mitigate these environmental issues. For example, investing in extensive cycling infrastructure and improving the reliability and coverage of public transport could help reduce the nation's reliance on cars, resulting in improved public health and cleaner air.Furthermore, implementing international laws to regulate car ownership could help address the socioeconomic inequalities often associated with vehicle ownership. In many urban areas, owning a car is a privilege that leads to unequal access to employment and resources. Potential regulations could include stricter emissions standards, limits on vehicle registration, or incentives for using alternative transportation modes. Such measures could promote a more equitable transportation environment and encourage a cultural shift towards sustainable practices.While it is acknowledged that cars are convenient and necessary for certain groups, it is essential to balance these needs with the broader responsibility to protect the environment and society. Ultimately, promoting alternative transportation methods and introducing regulations on car usage are critical steps towards creating a sustainable future, ensuring that roads are not only filled with vehicles but are also safe, healthy, and accessible for everyone.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";The discussion about whether wealthy countries should offer financial support to less affluent nations has gained significant attention in recent years. I firmly believe that richer countries have a moral responsibility to assist less developed countries, and this conviction is based on ethical, economic, and global stability considerations.The significant wealth disparities worldwide necessitate a compassionate response from richer nations. Many impoverished countries struggle with substantial challenges, including insufficient healthcare, inadequate education systems, and poor infrastructure. Wealthier nations can contribute to sustainable development initiatives that aim to reduce poverty, improve living standards, and increase access to essential services by providing financial aid. The positive impact of such support not only improves individual lives but also contributes to a more equitable global community.Furthermore, the global economy is becoming increasingly interconnected, with the stability of wealthy nations often tied to the prosperity of poorer countries. Economic instability in developing nations can lead to increased migration, political unrest, and security threats, ultimately affecting richer countries. Investing in the development of poorer nations can stimulate economic growth, creating new markets for products and services and benefiting both parties. By promoting stability and economic growth in developing regions, rich countries can ensure a more prosperous and secure global environment.Additionally, the urgent issues of climate change and pandemics highlight the need for global cooperation. Wealthier nations possess the necessary resources, technology, and expertise to support poorer countries in addressing these challenges. Failure to collectively address these issues could exacerbate global inequalities and pose risks to all nations.In conclusion, the financial assistance provided by rich countries to poorer nations is essential for achieving global equity, enhancing international relations, and ensuring a sustainable future. The approach should focus not only on alleviating immediate hardship but also on empowering these nations to achieve long-term self-sufficiency.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";Globalization is widely regarded as a potent driver of economic expansion, global interconnectedness, and cultural diversity. It has fostered international trade, heightened competition, and created economic opportunities, especially in developing countries. Nevertheless, despite the significant positive effects of globalization, it is crucial to acknowledge and mitigate its adverse consequences to comprehensively understand its implications on the global economy.On the positive side, advocates of globalization contend that it has yielded unprecedented economic gains. By enabling countries to specialize in areas where they have a comparative advantage, globalization boosts efficiency and productivity. For instance, nations abundant in natural resources can export these commodities while importing technology and manufactured goods from more industrialized nations. This interdependence among nations frequently leads to economic growth, job creation, and enhanced living standards.However, the negative aspects of globalization cannot be ignored. A pressing concern is the widening economic disparity within and between nations. While certain regions thrive, others may struggle, leading to increased disparities in wealth distribution. Furthermore, the competition to minimize labor standards and environmental regulations can occur, as multinational corporations seek to maximize profits by exploiting cheaper labor and lenient regulations in less affluent nations. This can result in subpar working conditions, human rights violations, and environmental degradation.Additionally, globalization can lead to cultural homogenization, where local customs and identities are at risk of being overshadowed by dominant global cultures. This not only threatens cultural diversity but can also give rise to social unrest and greater political instability.In conclusion, while globalization offers numerous economic benefits, its accompanying negative effects must be recognized. A balanced approach that harnesses the advantages of globalization while ensuring protections for workers, the environment, and local cultures is essential to creating a more equitable and sustainable global economy. It is imperative to adopt a nuanced perspective that acknowledges both the benefits and drawbacks of globalization, and to strive for a more inclusive and environmentally conscious globalization that promotes economic growth, social justice, and cultural diversity.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The discussion about the relevance of certain school subjects and the possibility of allowing students to leave school early has gained significant attention in recent years. Although some students may feel disconnected from their studies due to a perceived lack of relevance, advocating for early school leaving overlooks the far-reaching consequences of education.Education plays a multifaceted role that extends beyond mere career preparation. It promotes critical thinking, creativity, and the ability to engage with diverse perspectives. Subjects like literature and mathematics, which may seem irrelevant to some, are crucial in developing a well-rounded individual equipped to tackle complex societal challenges. For example, literature fosters empathy and cultural awareness, while mathematics enhances problem-solving skills that can be applied in various contexts.Furthermore, permitting students to leave school prematurely based on their current interests could lead to a substantial loss of learning opportunities. Young individuals often lack the foresight to understand the potential benefits of subjects that may seem useless to them at present. Exposure to various fields of knowledge can spark passions and open doors to unexpected career paths that a narrow focus might otherwise limit. Additionally, allowing early exits from school could exacerbate existing educational inequalities. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds may be more likely to opt for low-paying, unfulfilling jobs that perpetuate the cycle of poverty. An education system that encourages premature departure risks reinforcing societal inequalities and potentially diminishing the overall skill level of the workforce.In conclusion, while it is essential to consider students' interests and make education more relevant, advocating for early school exits could have detrimental effects. A more balanced approach would involve reforming curricula to incorporate practical and vocational training while ensuring that fundamental skills and knowledge remain accessible to all students, preparing them not just for careers, but for life.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;The idea that high demand for popular consumer goods is driven more by the power of advertising than by actual societal needs is a subject of ongoing debate. I tend to support this perspective, as advertising has a significant impact on shaping consumer perceptions and desires, often overshadowing genuine needs in the market.In today's society, advertising plays a crucial role in shaping consumer behavior. Companies use advanced marketing tactics that create emotional connections, foster brand loyalty, and stimulate desires for products that are not necessarily essential for daily life. For instance, fashion brands use celebrity endorsements and social media influencers to promote their products as status symbols and identity markers. This often leads to consumers buying items not because they need them, but because they want to fit in or impress others. As a result, high sales figures for these products may be a testament to effective advertising rather than a reflection of genuine need.Furthermore, the consumer culture promoted by advertising creates a cycle where individuals feel pressured to buy the latest products to stay socially relevant. This can be seen in the tech industry, where consumers eagerly await new smartphone releases, not because their current devices are inadequate, but because they are convinced by advertising that they need the latest model, which is marketed as essential.It's worth noting, however, that some level of advertising does serve a purpose by informing consumers about genuinely useful products that meet their needs. For example, ads for household essentials or health-related products can help consumers make informed decisions that improve their quality of life. Nevertheless, the dominant influence of advertising tends to distort perceptions of necessity, contributing to a culture of overconsumption.In conclusion, while there are instances where advertising effectively highlights real needs, I believe that the prevailing trend is for advertising to manipulate consumer desires, resulting in high sales of goods driven more by marketing strategies than genuine societal needs.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;The discussion around gun ownership is intricate and has many layers, but there is a strong case for restricting ownership to improve public safety and decrease violence. Primarily, the data reveals a link between high gun ownership rates and a higher number of gun-related fatalities. Nations with strict gun control laws usually see significantly lower homicide and suicide rates, suggesting that limiting access to guns could yield similar results.A primary justification for restricting gun ownership is the prevention of gun violence. In areas with lax regulations, guns often end up in the hands of individuals who may misuse them, including those with mental health issues or a history of violence. By enforcing stricter background checks and limitations, it becomes more difficult for these individuals to obtain guns, thereby preventing potential tragedies.Furthermore, restricting gun ownership can enhance community safety. The widespread presence of guns can lead to a culture of fear and mistrust among community members. When people believe those around them may be armed, it can heighten tensions and lead to situations escalating into violence more quickly. Communities can feel safer when fewer individuals possess guns, allowing for more productive interactions and fostering a collaborative environment.Another vital aspect is the potential for harm within households. Studies indicate that homes with guns are significantly more likely to experience accidental shootings, domestic violence, and suicides. By restricting gun ownership, especially in homes with children or individuals at risk of self-harm, we can reduce the tragic outcomes that often result from unregulated access to guns.In summary, restricting gun ownership is essential for enhancing public safety. Through responsible policies that balance individual rights with community welfare, society can strive towards a future where the risks associated with guns are minimized, ultimately leading to safer environments for everyone.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;The idea that major sporting events, such as the football World Cup, play a significant role in reducing international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions is a notion worth exploring. Although some people may claim that sports can exacerbate rivalries and nationalism, I largely concur that these events, when approached with a sense of friendship and competition, can indeed promote global unity and understanding.Global sporting events offer a unique platform for nations to unite, bridging cultural and political gaps. For example, during the World Cup, fans from diverse countries gather to celebrate the sport, fostering interaction and dialogue among different populations. This cultural exchange enables individuals to appreciate diverse backgrounds and traditions, often leading to a greater sense of global community. Additionally, the passion displayed by fans can be directed towards positive expressions of national pride, rather than aggression or hostility.The nature of sports themselves focuses on competition, not conflict. Athletes represent their countries in pursuit of excellence, creating a spirit of friendly rivalry that often diminishes animosity. The cooperative aspect of sports, where players work together towards a common goal, reflects the potential for international collaboration. The World Cup, for instance, becomes a celebration of skills and teamwork, allowing for a healthy release of patriotic emotions through team support, rather than through political tensions.However, it's crucial to recognize that some sporting events can be tainted by fan violence or tensions, which can undermine unity. Nevertheless, such instances are often exceptions rather than the norm.In conclusion, while it's essential to acknowledge the complexities surrounding national pride and international relations, I believe that events like the football World Cup primarily offer a positive outlet for easing tensions and promoting global solidarity. Through shared experiences and mutual respect, these events can indeed foster peace and understanding in a fractured world. 
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;The pervasive influence of technology on modern life has sparked a heated debate about its effects on socio-economic disparities. On one hand, some people believe that technology widens the gap between the rich and the poor, while on the other hand, others argue that it promotes equality and democratizes opportunities.Those who think technology exacerbates wealth disparities point out that access to cutting-edge technologies is often limited to the wealthy. For example, individuals from affluent backgrounds can afford high-quality technology education, which leads to lucrative careers in tech-related fields. Moreover, expensive devices and high-speed internet are often unaffordable for low-income individuals, creating a digital divide that hinders their ability to compete in a technology-driven economy. The unequal distribution of technological resources, with a concentration in urban areas, further widens the gap between rural and urban communities.In contrast, proponents of the view that technology reduces socio-economic disparities argue that it offers numerous tools and platforms that foster economic mobility. The internet has made vast amounts of information and educational resources available, enabling people from all backgrounds to acquire new skills. Online learning platforms, for instance, provide affordable or free courses that can be accessed by underserved populations, empowering them with necessary qualifications. Additionally, the gig economy, facilitated by technology, allows individuals to earn a living regardless of their location, potentially enhancing their financial independence.In conclusion, I believe that technology has the potential to either widen or bridge the socio-economic gap, and its actual impact depends on the policies and systems in place to ensure fair access. To utilize technology as a tool for inclusivity, it is essential to invest in infrastructure and provide educational opportunities that empower all individuals. Only through a collective effort can we ensure that technological advancements benefit society as a whole and promote economic equality.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;The exploration of outer space has long fascinated humanity, prompting numerous governments to dedicate significant financial resources to this pursuit. Although some critics argue that these expenditures detract from pressing global issues, I firmly believe that investing in space exploration is a justified and necessary commitment that yields substantial benefits across various domains.Initially, space exploration is a key driver of technological innovation. Many modern technologies, such as satellite communication systems, GPS, and advanced materials, were developed as a result of space research initiatives. These technologies have far-reaching benefits that extend beyond convenience, enhancing global communication, improving disaster response, and boosting sectors like healthcare and agriculture. By investing in space exploration, governments not only advance scientific knowledge but also stimulate economic growth through the creation of new industries and job opportunities.Furthermore, international collaboration in space exploration promotes peace and cooperation among nations. Joint programs like the International Space Station demonstrate how countries can unite towards a common objective, fostering relationships that can help alleviate global tensions. Through collaborative missions and research, nations cultivate a spirit of cooperation that transcends borders, contributing to a more harmonious world.Lastly, as the Earth grapples with challenges like climate change, resource depletion, and overpopulation, space exploration offers potential solutions. Scientific research in microgravity environments could lead to breakthroughs in energy production or resource utilization, while long-term colonization projects may provide alternatives for humanity's survival. Pursuing these ambitious goals offers hope for a sustainable future.In conclusion, government investments in outer space exploration are not only reasonable, but essential. They serve as a catalyst for technological advancement, foster international cooperation, and hold the potential to address the existential challenges facing humanity. As we explore the cosmos, we must also acknowledge the profound benefits that space exploration brings to our home planet.
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;The idea of teenagers balancing part-time jobs with their academic pursuits has sparked a heated debate. In some countries, this practice is common and has both positive and negative aspects. In my opinion, having a job during adolescence can be beneficial for students, provided it is managed properly.One of the most significant advantages of part-time employment for teenagers is the acquisition of essential life skills. By juggling work and school, students develop vital skills such as time management, responsibility, and commitment. These skills are invaluable as they enter adulthood, preparing them for future employment opportunities. For example, a teenager working in retail not only earns a salary but also gains valuable customer service skills and learns to handle various situations professionally.Additionally, part-time jobs can provide teenagers with financial independence. By earning and managing their own money, teens develop a sense of autonomy and responsibility. This experience teaches them crucial financial literacy skills, including budgeting, saving, and investing. Understanding the value of money at a young age lays the foundation for responsible financial habits in the future.However, it is crucial to maintain a balance. Excessive work hours can lead to stress and negatively impact academic performance. Students should not compromise their education for the sake of part-time employment. Therefore, it is essential for teenagers to seek jobs that offer flexible hours and do not overwhelm them.In conclusion, while there are risks associated with teenagers working while attending school, the benefits, including the development of vital life skills and financial independence, outweigh the drawbacks when part-time jobs are managed effectively. With proper guidance and a balanced approach, part-time employment can be a valuable experience for young individuals, teaching them essential skills and preparing them for future success.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;The integration of short-term unpaid work placements into modern educational curricula is becoming increasingly prevalent. This practice offers numerous advantages for both students and organizations, promoting hands-on experience and community involvement.Students can greatly benefit from unpaid work placements, as they provide opportunities to acquire practical skills that may not be covered in traditional academic settings. By participating in real-world tasks, students can apply theoretical knowledge, leading to enhanced comprehension and retention of course materials. These experiences also enable students to explore potential career paths, gain insight into professional environments, and develop essential soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. Moreover, interacting with professionals in their desired fields allows students to establish networks that can be advantageous in their future job searches, giving them a competitive edge in the employment market.In turn, organizations and institutions can also gain substantial benefits from hosting students. By offering guidance and supervision, organizations can promote community engagement and corporate social responsibility. Students often bring innovative ideas and fresh perspectives that can positively impact the organization's projects and initiatives. Additionally, they can help reduce workloads for full-time employees, allowing them to focus on more complex tasks while enriching the workplace culture with their enthusiasm and eagerness to learn.It is crucial, however, for both students and organizations to acknowledge that such placements must be structured and mutually beneficial. Ensuring that students receive sufficient guidance and that organizations clearly define the scope of work can result in more productive experiences. In conclusion, when effectively implemented, short-term unpaid work placements can be highly beneficial, preparing students for their future careers while also enriching organizations with valuable contributions and innovative ideas.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;The idea that higher pay is the only motivator for employees to work harder and be more productive is a topic of debate. Although higher salaries can certainly motivate employees to perform better, it's too simplistic to think that money is the only thing that drives them.First, it's crucial to understand that employees' inner motivations play a significant role in their performance. Factors like enjoying their job, making progress, and feeling accomplished can greatly impact how hard they work. Many employees seek purpose in their work and when they connect their job to their personal values or goals, they can be more productive without needing a pay raise. Research has shown that when employees feel valued by their colleagues and employers, they tend to perform better regardless of their salary.Furthermore, the work environment and culture have a profound effect on motivation. A supportive atmosphere that recognizes employees' efforts, offers opportunities for teamwork, and has effective leadership can lead to high employee engagement. Companies that foster a sense of community and teamwork tend to inspire employees to put in extra effort, showing that workplace dynamics can be just as important as pay.In addition to inner motivations and work culture, non-financial incentives like career advancement opportunities, flexible work arrangements, and health benefits can also boost employee productivity. Employees appreciate the chance to develop new skills, balance work and life, and feel secure in their jobs, which can result in higher performance.In summary, while higher pay can motivate employees, it's not the only factor. A more comprehensive approach that includes inner motivation, work culture, and non-financial incentives is necessary for creating a dedicated and productive workforce.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;The claim that major international events, as exemplified by the football World Cup, play a pivotal role in alleviating global tensions and offering a secure outlet for nationalistic sentiments is indeed substantiated. These occassions present a distinctive platform where individuals and nations engage in competion with a sensse of camaraderie and shared delight, thereby promoting peace and understanding.Primarily, global sporting events unite disparate populaces, encouraging cross-cultural exchange that can lead to enhanced diplomatic relashions. The World Cup, for instance, draws fans from diverse nations together in a shared celebrashion of sports, often bridging politcal divides and hostilites between countries. The universal langage of sports enables connecton and mutual respect, fostering a sensse of unity over divisieness.Furthermore, these events provide a safe and regulated environent for expresing national pride, allowing citizens to rally behind their teams and celebrace victories, which can enhance national morale and create a sensse of belongng among citizens, focusing on shared identites rather than differencess.However, it is esencial to acknolege that internashional sporting events can also exaserbate tensions, particurarly when politcal agendas are involvd or when ther is a histary of rivalry between nations. Insrances of aggresive nashionalism or hostilite can mar the spirite of these occashions. Thereby, while these events posess the potenshal to allevitae global tenshions and channel nashionalistic sentimunts positivly, ther can also evoke negatvie emotins if not maneged approprightly.In conclusin, while internashional sporting occashions, as exemplified by the World Cup, ar not a universl solushion for global tenshions, ther undenibly provid a constrctive outlet for nashionalistic fervor and foster a spirite of unity among pipel of diverse backgronds. When embrased with the rite atitdue, ther can promot peace, understanding, and shared joi on a global scle.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;The discussion around energy sources has never been more relevant, as nations struggle to address the intertwined issues of climate change, energy security, and sustainable growth. I strongly believe that governments must take concerted action to promote alternative energy sources, as the advantages of doing so extend far beyond environmental conservation to include economic stability and public well-being.The primary reason for transitioning to alternative energy sources is rooted in environmental necessity. Conventional fossil fuels are substantial contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, which have severe consequences for both the climate and public health. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power offer cleaner options that significantly decrease carbon emissions. Encouraging alternative energy aligns with international commitments like the Paris Agreement, aiming to restrict global warming and alleviate climate-related catastrophes.Furthermore, investing in alternative energy technologies enhances economic robustness. The renewable energy sector has exhibited remarkable expansion, generating employment opportunities in diverse fields ranging from manufacturing to installation and maintenance. Governments that prioritize the growth of these industries not only stimulate job creation but also augment energy independence, diminishing reliance on imported fuels. This transition can yield more stable energy costs and localized economic advancement.Additionally, promoting alternative energy leads to improvements in public health. The decrease in air pollution resulting from fossil fuel combustion can lead to fewer health problems, considerably reducing healthcare expenses and enhancing the quality of life. Clean energy sources can also improve energy access in underserved communities, providing them with dependable power while protecting their health.In summary, I firmly support the notion that governments should intensify their efforts to promote alternative energy sources. The transition to alternative energy not only tackles pressing environmental challenges but also yields economic and health benefits. Collective action towards adopting cleaner energy sources is vital for a sustainable future, rendering it essential for policymakers to prioritize this critical initiative.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;The issue of whether governments should offer direct financial assistance to unemployed individuals is a pressing concern in today's society. I strongly endorse the notion that direct financial support is vital for those without employment.The primary reason for this is that unemployment often results in substantial financial hardship, impacting both individuals and their families. Losing a job frequently makes it difficult for people to afford basic necessities like food, shelter, and medical care. Direct financial aid serves as a vital safety net, ensuring these essential needs are fulfilled during times of economic uncertainty. Without such support, numerous individuals might be driven further into poverty, leading to severe consequences for their physical and mental well-being.Another significant advantage of direct financial aid is its potential to boost the economy. When unemployed individuals receive financial assistance, they are more inclined to spend this money on essential goods and services, thereby supporting local businesses. This rise in consumer spending can help counteract the negative effects of an economic downturn and may even facilitate economic revival. By assisting unemployed individuals, the government cultivates a more resilient economy that benefits everyone.Furthermore, providing direct financial aid can motivate individuals to pursue new job opportunities. Having financial stability enables unemployed individuals to invest in further education or vocational training, thus enhancing their skills and increasing their chances of finding employment. This proactive strategy not only benefits the individuals affected but also contributes to a more skilled and capable workforce, ultimately benefiting the economy in the long term.In summary, I firmly believe that governments have a critical role to play in providing direct financial support to unemployed individuals. This assistance not only alleviates immediate financial pressures but also fosters economic stability and encourages personal growth. In these uncertain times, it is essential that we establish systems ensuring every individual has the opportunity to recover and contribute positively to society.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;The question of whether universities should focus on providing students with job-ready skills or on imparting knowledge for its own sake is a complex issue with multiple facets. In my view, universities should strive to find a balance between these two approaches in order to effectively fulfill their purpose in a rapidly changing world.On the one hand, the case for equipping students with practical skills is based on the current state of the global job market, which increasingly prioritizes candidates with relevant skills. Given the rising cost of tuition and the growing burden of student debt, prospective students are highly aware of the need for a return on their educational investment. Universities that focus on vocational training and skill development tend to improve their graduates' chances of finding employment, aligning their academic programs with the demands of industry. This practical approach enables students to make a smooth transition from academia to the workforce, contributing to economic growth and social progress.On the other hand, the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is also essential and should not be overlooked. Education is not just about preparing for a career, but is a transformative experience that fosters critical thinking, creativity, and intellectual exploration. Certain fields, such as philosophy, history, and the arts, inherently promote these values, contributing to a well-rounded education. A curriculum that encourages a love of learning cultivates informed and thoughtful citizens who contribute to society in a variety of ways, from cultural enrichment to social innovation.Ultimately, universities should aim to provide a model that combines both aspects. By offering courses that teach practical skills while also nurturing intellectual curiosity, universities can produce graduates who are not only skilled professionals, but also informed and responsible citizens. This dual approach prepares students for the complexities of modern life, enabling them to adapt to the evolving demands of the workforce and engage meaningfully in broader societal discussions. Therefore, the primary function of a university should be to integrate the practical and the philosophical, ensuring that education remains relevant and enriching.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;The discussion about the importance and usefulness of zoos is multifaceted and sparks intense debates, with passionate arguments on both sides. However, I strongly disagree with the notion that zoos are unnecessary. In reality, zoos are indispensable institutions in our society, as they significantly contribute to education, conservation, and research.One of the primary functions of zoos is to serve as centers of learning for people of all ages. By offering opportunities for up-close interactions with animals, they promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of the natural world. The educational programs and exhibits at zoos help visitors gain knowledge about animal behavior, habitats, and the challenges faced by different species. For instance, visits to zoos often inspire children to develop a passion for conservation, leading them to take proactive steps to protect endangered species in their natural habitats.Another crucial role of zoos is their contribution to conservation efforts. Many zoos participate in breeding programs for endangered species, which helps ensure the survival of species that might otherwise become extinct. The successful breeding of species like the Arabian oryx and the California condor in zoos demonstrates their direct impact on species recovery. Additionally, zoos engage in projects aimed at preserving habitats, often collaborating with global conservation initiatives to safeguard wildlife and their ecosystems.Lastly, zoos function as research institutions, advancing our knowledge of animal health, behavior, and ecology. By studying animals in a controlled environment, researchers can gain insights into their natural behaviors, leading to breakthroughs in fields such as veterinary medicine and animal behavior. This research benefits not only the animals in zoos but also informs and enhances conservation strategies for animals in the wild.In summary, despite criticisms of zoos regarding animal welfare, their significant contributions to education, conservation, and research should not be underestimated. Zoos play a vital role in fostering a more harmonious relationship between humans and wildlife, ultimately promoting a future where both can coexist and thrive. Therefore, I firmly believe that zoos have a significant and meaningful purpose in the modern world.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;The rise of distance-learning programs has revolutionized the educational landscape, offering unparalleled flexibility and accessibility to learners globally. Nevertheless, the debate surrounding their effectiveness compared to traditional in-person education remains a highly contested issue. In my opinion, while acknowledging the value of both approaches, I am inclined to believe that distance-learning programs can be just as effective as their traditional counterparts, albeit with unique challenges.One of the primary advantages of distance learning is its flexibility, which caters to a diverse range of learners. Individuals with occupational, familial, or geographical obligations can pursue their education without being bound by a rigid schedule. Online courses typically enable students to progress at their own pace, allowing them to strike a balance between multiple responsibilities and academic objectives. This increased accessibility can lead to higher enrollment and participation rates among individuals who may have been previously excluded from traditional educational institutions.However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations inherent in distance learning, particularly with regards to the interpersonal aspects of education. Traditional classroom settings facilitate face-to-face interactions, which can enhance communication skills, foster collaborative learning, and cultivate deep connections amongst peers and instructors. The socialization that occurs within a physical setting is vital for personal growth and networking opportunities, which may be less prevalent in online environments.Moreover, distance learning demands a high degree of personal discipline and motivation. Without the structured setting of a traditional classroom, students may struggle with time management and self-directed learning. Certain individuals thrive in a conventional setting where they can receive immediate feedback and support from instructors.In conclusion, while distance-learning programs have transformed the educational landscape by making it more accessible and flexible, they also present distinct challenges that may impact the learning experience. I firmly believe that the effectiveness of either approach is largely contingent upon the individual learner's personality, objectives, and circumstances. Therefore, rather than perceiving one method as superior, it is crucial to recognize the inherent strengths and limitations of both, and to adopt a more nuanced approach to education.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";The emergence of modern communication technology has transformed the way we connect, access information, and do business. Nevertheless, the advantages of this progress are not shared equally by all. I concur that although numerous individuals and industries have gained substantial benefits from these technologies, a considerable segment of the population remains at a disadvantage.On the one hand, modern communication technologies like smartphones, social media, and video conferencing tools have significantly enhanced connectivity and efficiency. These tools have enabled businesses to engage in global interactions with ease, allowing companies to reach broader markets and collaborate across borders. For individuals, the ability to instantly connect with friends and family, regardless of geographical distance, has revolutionized social dynamics and fostered a sense of community among dispersed populations. Furthermore, online access to vast amounts of information has empowered individuals to acquire knowledge and develop skills at an unprecedented pace, bridging the educational gaps that previously existed.On the other hand, many groups and individuals have not reaped the benefits of these advancements. In several developing regions, limited access to reliable internet and devices hinders individuals from effectively utilizing modern communication technologies. This digital divide amplifies existing inequalities, further marginalizing those who are already disadvantaged in terms of education and economic opportunities. Additionally, the rapid evolution of technologies can be challenging for older generations to adapt, resulting in social isolation rather than enhanced connectivity. Moreover, the pervasive nature of these technologies can lead to negative consequences such as cyberbullying, misinformation, and a decline in face-to-face interactions.In conclusion, while modern communication technologies have undoubtedly improved lives for many, it is crucial to acknowledge that their benefits are not experienced universally. Efforts must be made to ensure everyone has the chance to utilize the power of these tools, fostering a more inclusive digital landscape.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;The discussion around making music lessons a required part of high school education brings up strong points on both sides. Some people think these lessons are a waste of important academic time, but I believe that including music in the school curriculum is necessary for students to develop fully and should be considered essential.Most importantly, music education helps students be creative and express themselves. In a world where science and technology are becoming more and more dominant, it's crucial to nurture students' artistic abilities. Music lessons give students a way to explore their feelings and thoughts, which helps them gain confidence and develop a strong sense of identity. These experiences contribute to better mental health by teaching students how to deal with the challenges of being a teenager.Additionally, learning to play an instrument or studying music theory has been shown to improve cognitive skills. Research shows that students who participate in music education tend to do better academically, especially in subjects like math and language arts. Music requires discipline, focus, and practice, which are skills that can be applied to other areas of study. By making music lessons a part of the school curriculum, schools can enhance students' artistic abilities and also improve their overall academic performance.Furthermore, music education promotes teamwork and collaboration. When students work together to prepare for group performances, they learn the importance of cooperation and working towards a common goal. These experiences are valuable because they reflect real-world situations, preparing students for future professional environments where collaboration is often key.In summary, while some people may think music lessons are unnecessary, the many benefits they provide to students outweigh any perceived drawbacks. Making music education mandatory in high schools is not just about learning music, but about developing creativity, cognitive skills, and social collaboration. As we educate future generations, it's essential to recognize the importance of a well-rounded education that includes the arts.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;Universities play a vital role in shaping the academic, social, and physical development of their students. The distribution of funds between sports activities and libraries has long been a subject of debate. In my opinion, universities should allocate equal funding to both areas, as they serve distinct yet essential purposes in the lives of students.Libraries are traditional hubs of knowledge, providing students with access to a vast array of resources that are crucial for academic achievement. They facilitate research, promote critical thinking, and create an environment conducive to learning. Increased library funding enables students to utilize the latest academic materials, technology, and safe study spaces. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that academic success is not solely dependent on intellectual pursuits.In contrast, sports activities make a significant contribution to the physical and mental well-being of students. Participating in sports helps students develop valuable life skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and time management. Furthermore, physical activity is essential for maintaining mental health, particularly during periods of academic stress. By investing in sports programs, universities can promote a balanced lifestyle, encouraging students to prioritize their health alongside their academic pursuits.Allocating equal funding to sports programs acknowledges the importance of holistic student development. When universities invest equally in libraries and sports, they demonstrate a commitment to valuing the diverse needs of their students. This approach fosters the development of well-rounded individuals who are not only academically competent but also physically fit and socially engaged.In conclusion, equal funding for sports activities and university libraries is crucial for creating a balanced educational environment. Both elements support different aspects of student life, and a balanced allocation of resources can enhance both academic performance and personal growth, ultimately preparing students for successful futures. By recognizing the importance of both intellectual and physical development, universities can provide students with a comprehensive education that prepares them for success in all areas of life.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";The increasing dominance of English as a global language has had a profound impact on communication, commerce, and culture worldwide. However, this dominance has a significant downside: the gradual decline and potential extinction of numerous lesser-known languages. Although the widespread use of English has undeniable benefits, the drawbacks, particularly the erosion of linguistic diversity, are substantial and should not be ignored.On the one hand, the widespread use of English has facilitated global communication and access to information, serving as a common platform for people from diverse backgrounds to interact and cooperate. English is often seen as the key to unlocking opportunities, enabling individuals to improve their educational and career prospects in a globalized world. For example, proficiency in English is a requirement for many jobs in multinational companies and is essential for academic pursuits in prestigious institutions.On the other hand, the dominance of English poses a significant threat to the world's linguistic heritage. As younger generations increasingly prefer English for social and economic reasons, many languages are at risk of disappearing. The loss of a language also means the loss of an entire culture, including its history, traditions, and unique perspectives. This erosion of linguistic diversity diminishes our collective human experience, as each language offers distinct expressions of identity and understanding that cannot be easily translated into another language.Moreover, the marginalization of lesser-known languages creates a power imbalance, where native speakers may feel compelled to abandon their linguistic heritage in favor of a dominant language. This shift affects not only individual identities but also erodes community bonds and cultural continuity.In conclusion, while the convenience and opportunities provided by the global prevalence of English are notable, the disadvantages, particularly the loss of linguistic diversity and cultural richness, are profound. It is essential to strike a balance between the use of English as a global language and the preservation of lesser-known languages, ensuring that the world remains a rich tapestry of vibrant cultures and histories. This balance will allow for the coexistence of English as a global language and the preservation of linguistic diversity, ultimately enriching our collective human experience.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The long-standing discussion about the treatment of animals is a highly divisive issue, with some people believing that animals should be utilized for human benefit, while others advocate for the protection of animal rights. Proponents of using animals for human gain argue that animals have always played a crucial role in human survival and advancement, providing essential resources such as food, clothing, and labor, as well as serving as companions and assistance animals. They contend that, as the dominant species, it is natural for humans to leverage animals to meet their various needs, whether through farming, research, or companionship.On the other hand, animal rights advocates emphasize the moral implications of exploiting animals solely for human benefit. They argue that animals are sentient beings, capable of experiencing emotions and sensations, and therefore deserve to be treated with respect and protected from harm. Many practices in animal agriculture, such as factory farming, animal testing, and entertainment, are widely criticized for their inhumane treatment of animals. From an ethical perspective, it is essential to prioritize compassion and respect for all living beings, suggesting that humans should develop alternative methods that do not involve animal suffering or sacrifice.At the heart of this debate is the need to balance human needs with moral responsibilities. While some uses of animals, such as service animals providing support to those in need, can be justified, it is crucial that the methods used are humane and ethical. It is essential to pioneer practices that prioritize animal welfare, acknowledging and respecting their rights. Ultimately, the goal is to strike a balance between benefiting from animals and upholding their dignity, fostering a coexistence that enriches both humans and animals.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";The emergence of modern technology has revolutionized the way we experience and interact with art and culture, enabling individuals to explore exhibitions from the comfort of their own homes. Although this shift has sparked concerns about the potential demise of traditional museums and art galleries, I firmly believe that these institutions will not become obsolete. Instead, they will undergo a transformation, adapting to the evolving technological landscape and emerging stronger and more resilient.The primary reason for this is that the immersive and multisensory experience provided by physical museums and galleries is difficult to replicate in a digital format. Visiting a museum or gallery allows individuals to engage with artworks on a profound level, one that digital platforms struggle to match. The size, texture, and subtle nuances of physical artworks evoke a distinct emotional response when experienced in person, fostering a deeper connection with the art. Additionally, the unique atmosphere of a museum, which encompasses its architecture, lighting, and the quiet reverence of the space, significantly enhances the art appreciation experience. This distinctive environment, which is characterized by its tranquility and sense of community, cannot be fully replicated through digital means or virtual reality.Another significant factor is that museums and galleries serve as communal hubs that facilitate social interaction, discourse, and a sense of shared experience among visitors. They bring together diverse groups of people who are united by their interest in art and culture, thereby fostering a sense of community and belonging. The experience of discussing artworks, attending events, or participating in workshops creates a dynamic and engaging atmosphere that is inherently lacking in virtual experiences. This social aspect is particularly crucial in an increasingly digital world, where human connection and community are often lacking.Furthermore, many museums have successfully integrated technology into their operations, using it as a tool to enhance the visitor experience rather than replace it. Innovations such as virtual reality tours, online exhibitions, and digital collections have enabled institutions to reach a broader audience, engage with visitors who may not be able to visit in person, and provide new and innovative ways to experience art. By embracing technology in this way, museums and galleries are able to complement their physical offerings, rather than replace them.In conclusion, while modern technology has undoubtedly altered the way we engage with art and exhibitions, it does not signal the impending demise of museums and galleries. On the contrary, these institutions are likely to continue thriving, as they adapt and evolve in response to technological advancements. By integrating technology in a way that enhances, rather than replaces, the unique experience of viewing art in person, museums and galleries will remain vibrant and relevant, continuing to inspire, educate, and
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;The age-old debate about whether teenagers should receive a comprehensive education covering a wide range of subjects or focus on those they excel in or enjoy has sparked intense discussion, with compelling arguments on both sides.Advocates of a broad-based education argue that being exposed to multiple subjects is vital for acquiring a diverse set of skills. By studying various disciplines like math, literature, science, and the arts, students can cultivate critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. This broad-based knowledge can prepare students for an uncertain future where flexibility is crucial. Moreover, exploring different subjects can help students uncover hidden talents and interests that may have gone unexplored. A strong foundation in multiple areas can also enhance collaboration skills, as students interact with peers from diverse academic backgrounds.In contrast, proponents of specialization argue that focusing on subjects where students show aptitude or passion leads to greater engagement and motivation. Customizing education to individual strengths can result in a deeper grasp and mastery of specific subjects, potentially yielding greater accomplishments and satisfaction. Critics of traditional education argue that a standardized approach can suppress creativity and demotivate students who struggle in non-preferred subjects. By allowing students to concentrate on their interests, educators can foster a more enthusiastic and driven generation.In my view, a balanced approach that combines elements of both perspectives is optimal. While a well-rounded education is essential, offering students the opportunity to explore subjects that spark their passion can enrich their learning experience. Educational systems should promote interdisciplinary studies while also providing personalized learning paths, thereby equipping students with both breadth and depth in their academic pursuits. This strategy can cultivate a generation of learners who are knowledgeable, motivated, and deeply invested in their education.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;"The global spread of English as a common language has greatly improved communication and economic prospects across different cultures. Nevertheless, this development also has significant consequences for smaller languages, many of which are disappearing at a worrying rate. The discussion about whether the benefits of English being the dominant language outweigh its drawbacks is complicated and has many aspects.On the one hand, the benefits of a shared language like English are obvious. It promotes global conversation, increases business opportunities, and provides access to information and technology. In a world where everything is connected, English acts as a link, allowing people from different backgrounds to work together and innovate. For example, international scientific communities often publish their research in English, which helps spread their findings and increase their impact. This not only helps academic progress but also economic growth in countries involved in the global market.On the other hand, the decline of smaller languages is a significant loss, not just for the people who speak them, but for humanity as a whole. Each language represents unique cultural identities, histories, and perspectives. As these languages disappear, so do the customs, knowledge systems, and viewpoints they carry. The loss of a language is similar to the destruction of an ecosystem rich in biodiversity; it reduces our shared cultural heritage and decreases the richness of human expression. Moreover, linguistic diversity is essential for encouraging creativity and innovation; different languages offer varied ways of thinking that can inspire new solutions to problems.In summary, while the benefits of English as a global language offer undeniable advantages in terms of communication and economic opportunity, the disadvantages - mainly the erosion of cultural diversity and the loss of unique identities - are substantial. To promote linguistic diversity, efforts should be made to encourage bilingualism and preserve less common languages. Ultimately, preserving the world's languages should be a priority, alongside the benefits provided by the widespread use of English."
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";The unrestricted freedom of artists to express themselves is a fundamental aspect of cultural expression and innovation. The idea that artists should be able to express themselves without limitation - whether through writing, visual arts, music, or film - warrants an examination of the advantages and potential downsides of this freedom. I firmly believe that artists should be allowed to express their thoughts and ideas without government interference, as this encourages artistic innovation, diversity of thought, and social advancement.One key argument in favor of unrestricted artistic expression is that it sparks creativity and innovation. When artists are free to explore unconventional ideas and push boundaries, they often create new and innovative forms of art. For example, the development of avant-garde art movements and experimental music has significantly contributed to the evolution of the arts. A society that allows diverse artistic voices to flourish is more likely to thrive, as these voices can challenge societal norms and provide fresh perspectives, fostering an environment that encourages creativity and progress.Moreover, artistic expression plays a crucial role in reflecting societal issues and advocating for change. Throughout history, artists have been instrumental in highlighting social injustices and shaping public opinion, such as the powerful protest songs during the civil rights movement or films that expose societal flaws. If artists are restricted by government, vital conversations that could lead to positive change may be silenced, depriving communities of valuable insights and critiques.It is, however, also important to consider the potential for the misuse of this freedom. Artists may promote harmful ideologies or offend specific groups. Rather than imposing restrictions, a more effective approach might involve promoting critical discourse and education about the impact of art on society.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the content of artistic expression, the benefits of granting artists unrestricted freedom far outweigh the potential drawbacks. A culture that values free expression is more likely to be rich, vibrant, and dynamic, and to encourage open dialogue about critical societal issues, ultimately leading to a more progressive and enlightened society.
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;The age-old debate about whether competition or cooperation is more beneficial for children's development has sparked intense discussion. Advocates of competition believe it breeds determination and resilience in children, preparing them for the competitive nature of adulthood, where job markets and social interactions are dominated by rivalry. They argue that fostering a competitive mindset encourages children to set goals, work diligently, and develop self-esteem through achievements.In contrast, opponents of competition emphasize the value of cooperation in developing essential interpersonal skills. They contend that collaborative efforts teach children to communicate effectively, solve problems jointly, and appreciate diverse viewpoints - skills that are vital for success in personal and professional relationships in today's interconnected world. Cooperation also instills empathy, mutual support, and social harmony, promoting the ability to work as a team player, a crucial skill in most modern careers.In my view, striking a balance between competition and cooperation is vital for children's development. While healthy competition can motivate children and enhance individual abilities, it should not overshadow the importance of cooperation. Encouraging activities that promote both competitive spirit and teamwork can foster well-rounded individuals. Parents and schools should provide environments where children can experience the thrill of competition alongside opportunities to collaborate on projects and social activities.To sum up, both competition and cooperation have their merits. The key challenge is to effectively integrate these elements into a child's upbringing, enabling them to develop resilience and self-discipline through competition while learning the value of teamwork, empathy, and collaboration. By adopting a holistic approach, children are likely to grow into driven individuals who can contribute positively to society.
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";The discussion around capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a complicated and nuanced issue. Those in favor of it argue that it helps prevent violent crime, while those against it express concerns about the ethics of its use. Although some people believe that getting rid of the death penalty would lead to more crime and less safety, I think the relationship between these things is more complex and that there are better ways to keep the public safe.People who support capital punishment think that the fear of being executed will stop potential criminals from committing violent acts. They believe that if punishments are harsh and certain, it will discourage people from doing terrible things like murder, which would make society safer. However, research on whether the death penalty actually deters crime is not clear-cut. Many studies have shown that places without capital punishment do not necessarily have more violent crime than those with it. In fact, things like a person's economic situation, education, effective law enforcement, and community involvement have a bigger impact on crime rates.Additionally, the ethical implications of capital punishment are significant and cannot be ignored. The fact that the death penalty is permanent raises concerns about mistaken convictions, biases in how it is applied, and the moral implications of the state taking lives. Furthermore, capital punishment does not deal with the underlying reasons for violence, such as poverty, mental health problems, and drug abuse. If these issues were addressed, it could lead to a more significant reduction in crime.In summary, while some people think capital punishment is necessary for social order, I argue that it is not the best way to prevent violent crime. Rather, improving the justice system, focusing on rehabilitation, and addressing the underlying social problems are more effective ways to create a safer society.
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;The concept of taking a gap year, whether through work or travel, between completing high school and starting university has become increasingly popular among young people in various countries over the past few years. This decision comes with a range of benefits and drawbacks that need to be thoughtfully considered.One of the main advantages of a gap year is the chance for personal growth and development. Often, young adults finish high school with limited life experience and a narrow worldview. By traveling or working, they are exposed to different cultures, ideas, and viewpoints, which helps them become more independent and enhances essential life skills like communication, problem-solving, and adaptability. These experiences can significantly contribute to their personal maturity and development, allowing them to approach university with a broader perspective.Furthermore, working during a gap year can have financial advantages. Many young individuals can earn money to help cover university costs, reducing their reliance on student loans. This practical aspect promotes responsibility and prepares them for financial independence as adults.However, despite the advantages, there are also significant disadvantages to consider. A major concern is the potential loss of momentum in academic pursuits. After a year away from formal education, some students may find it difficult to adjust to the demands of university courses. Their familiarity with academic routines may fade, making it hard for them to readjust to scholarly life.Additionally, not all young people have equal opportunities or means to make the most of a gap year, whether through travel or work. Economic constraints can limit choices, leading to disparities among students and potentially widening social inequalities.In conclusion, while a gap year offers opportunities for personal growth, exploration, and financial benefits, it also involves risks related to maintaining academic momentum and ensuring equal access. Ultimately, the decision to take a gap year should be made after careful consideration of individual goals, circumstances, and readiness for such an experience.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";"The integration of computers into modern life has been seamless, with their presence felt in various aspects of daily activities, including commerce, healthcare, and transportation. As we move forward, it's evident that our reliance on computers will intensify. One potential growth area is artificial intelligence (AI), which has the capacity to transform sectors like education by introducing personalized learning systems tailored to individual student needs. Additionally, autonomous vehicles are poised to revolutionize the transportation sector, potentially decreasing accidents and enhancing mobility for the elderly and those with disabilities.Another promising direction is the use of computers in monitoring environmental changes. By utilizing advanced algorithms and data analysis, we can gain a deeper understanding of climate change, enabling proactive conservation and resource management strategies. In the healthcare sector, computers may play a crucial role in predictive analytics, where data analysis could forecast outbreaks or patient decline, allowing for timely medical interventions.However, this growing dependence on computers also raises significant concerns. Although the efficiency and innovation brought about by technology are undeniable, the risks associated with over-reliance on computers cannot be overlooked. Key issues such as data security and privacy are of utmost importance; as we entrust computers with more personal information, the risk of data breaches and misuse increases. Furthermore, societal disparities may worsen if access to these technologies remains limited to certain groups.Moreover, dependence on computers prompts existential questions about human capabilities. As automation takes over tasks, essential human skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking may deteriorate. In the event of a computational system failure, we may find ourselves unprepared to navigate the world without technological aid.In conclusion, while a future with increased computer dependence holds tremendous potential, it is essential to approach it with caution and balance. By embracing technological advancements while being mindful of their implications, we can ensure that society as a whole benefits without compromising fundamental human attributes and values."
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;The discussion about achieving equal numbers of male and female students in university admissions has intensified in recent years, with arguments centered around whether educational institutions should aim for equal representation across all disciplines. Although striving for gender equality is admirable, implementing a strict quota system may not be the most effective solution.On the one hand, promoting equal representation in fields traditionally dominated by men, such as engineering and computer science, helps address long-standing disparities that can lead to systemic inequalities in the professional world. Having a diverse range of genders in academic environments encourages inclusivity, collaboration, and a wide range of perspectives in research and development. Quotas could motivate institutions to implement strategies that attract and retain female students in these areas, ultimately leading to a more balanced job market.However, enforcing equal male and female admissions in every discipline raises concerns about fairness in the admissions process. Ideally, admissions should be based on individual ability, interest, and potential, rather than numerical quotas. Such policies could lead to a decline in academic standards and devalue the achievements of students who may not meet expectations due to artificially imposed gender equality.It's also important to acknowledge that different disciplines naturally attract different numbers of male and female students. Rather than enforcing equal numbers across the board, universities should focus on creating supportive environments and offering guidance programs that encourage underrepresented genders to explore various disciplines.In conclusion, while achieving gender equality in university admissions is important, imposing strict quotas may not be in the best interest of students or academic integrity. A more thoughtful approach that encourages inclusivity while respecting individual capabilities seems more suitable for addressing the challenges of gender imbalance in academia.
62;Do you agree or disagree with the statement: people will spend less time on cooking food;Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.;The way people approach cooking and meal preparation has undergone a significant change in recent years. The statement that individuals will devote less time to cooking is supported by several factors. One major reason for this trend is the increasing demands of modern life. As societies become more advanced, work and personal commitments often lead to longer working hours and busier schedules. With time at a premium, many people are turning to convenient options like takeout, pre-packaged meals, or quick microwaveable foods, rather than spending hours preparing meals from scratch.The rapid progress of technology has also had a profound impact on cooking habits. New kitchen appliances and gadgets, such as instant pots, air fryers, and meal kits, offer quick and easy solutions, making it possible for people to achieve good results without spending a lot of time in the kitchen. Furthermore, the growth of food delivery services has reduced the need to cook at home, as people can now access a wide range of cuisines with just a few taps on their smartphones.Changing social norms are also playing a role in reducing the time people spend cooking. There is a growing acceptance of eating out or ordering in, rather than cooking at home, particularly among younger generations, who often prioritize social experiences and convenience over traditional cooking practices.In summary, it is likely that the combination of busy lifestyles, technological advancements, and shifting cultural expectations is leading to a decrease in the time spent on cooking. Although cooking remains a valuable skill and a source of enjoyment for many, it is clear that convenience and efficiency are becoming increasingly important factors in people's decisions about how to prepare their meals.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;The age-old debate surrounding the benefits of traditional versus modern games in fostering children's skills continues to be a topic of discussion among educators, parents, and experts in child development. Although both types of games have their advantages, I firmly believe that traditional games offer a more holistic approach to skill development in children.Traditional games, which are typically played outdoors in group settings, play a crucial role in nurturing essential social skills such as cooperation, effective communication, and dispute resolution. By engaging in face-to-face interactions with their peers, children develop robust interpersonal skills. Games like tag or hide-and-seek, for example, require strategic thinking and collaboration, thereby enhancing their ability to function as a team member. Moreover, traditional games often involve physical activity, promoting not only physical well-being but also the capacity to navigate diverse environments and take calculated risks.In contrast, modern games, particularly video games, can enhance specific skills such as hand-eye coordination and problem-solving capabilities. Many modern games demand critical thinking and swift decision-making from players. However, these games often lack the interpersonal interactions that are vital for emotional intelligence and social growth. Additionally, excessive screen time can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and potential health problems in children.It is essential, however, to acknowledge that modern games can be educational and have a role to play in children's development, especially when designed to be enriching. Nevertheless, they cannot entirely replace the invaluable lessons learned through traditional games. In conclusion, while modern games possess certain benefits, traditional games are more effective in fostering a well-rounded set of skills in children. The emphasis on physical activity, social interaction, and the development of fundamental life skills inherent in traditional games underscores their significance in a child's overall development. Although balancing both types of play may be ideal, traditional games should remain an essential component of children's activities to ensure lasting skill development.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The allocation of government funds is a highly debated topic, with a particular focus on the balance between financing cultural institutions, such as theaters and sports stadiums, and essential services like healthcare and education. In my opinion, government spending should prioritize healthcare and education over recreational facilities.The primary reason for this is that healthcare is a basic necessity for human well-being. Having access to quality medical care has a direct impact on the health and productivity of citizens, as well as the overall performance of a nation. Underfunding has led to issues like overcrowding and inadequate treatment options in many countries. By making healthcare a priority, governments can ensure their citizens receive the medical care they need, regardless of their financial situation. This, in turn, leads to a healthier and more productive workforce, contributing to economic growth.Education is also crucial for societal advancement. Investing in education enhances individual potential, promotes critical thinking and innovation, and cultivates informed and active citizenship. Education provides people with the tools to overcome poverty and improve their social standing. On the other hand, spending on entertainment venues like theaters and stadiums may provide short-term enjoyment but could be more effectively used to create opportunities for future generations through improved education and training programs.Although cultural initiatives are important for community cohesion and artistic development, they should not take precedence over fundamental human rights such as healthcare and education. Governments can support cultural activities through community-based initiatives and funding without investing large amounts in new construction projects.In summary, prioritizing government spending on healthcare and education is both a moral duty and a wise investment in a nation's future. By focusing on the health and education of its citizens, a government sets the stage for a prosperous, well-informed, and healthy society.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;The notion that technological advancements inevitably lead to the erosion of traditional skills and ways of life has gained significant attention in current discussions. Although it is undeniable that technological progress can alter societies and make certain traditional practices less relevant, it is overly simplistic to assume that preserving these traditions is futile.On the one hand, the swift pace of technological advancements can overshadow traditional skills, rendering them less applicable in a rapidly changing modern world. For example, automation and digital tools have substantially changed industries such as farming and craftsmanship, where manual skills were once essential. This shift can lead to a decrease in the transmission of knowledge from older generations to younger ones, as career opportunities become more rooted in technology than traditional methods.On the other hand, dismissing the importance of traditional skills as outdated ignores their cultural significance and the valuable lessons they impart. Many indigenous practices and artisanal skills are deeply connected to identity, heritage, and community. They provide a sense of continuity and cultural connection that modern technology often cannot replicate. For instance, preserving traditional weaving techniques not only supports livelihoods but also promotes cultural diversity and pride. Efforts to maintain these practices can exist alongside technological progress and can even enhance it. The demand for authentic experiences from tourists can spark interest in traditional crafts, allowing them to thrive alongside modern industries.Ultimately, the discussion should not be framed as a straightforward choice between technology and tradition. Rather, we should acknowledge the potential for cooperation between the two. Technologies can be utilized to record, promote, and teach traditional skills, rather than replacing them. Therefore, while it is true that technology can change ways of life, it is equally crucial to advocate for the preservation and appreciation of traditional skills, ensuring they are respected and integrated into the complex fabric of modern society.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";The issue of creative freedom for artists is a nuanced and complex topic. On the one hand, artistic expression plays a vital role in advancing culture, exploring ideas, and reflecting societal shifts. Through various mediums such as literature, visual arts, music, and film, creativity has the power to challenge societal norms, stimulate thought, and motivate action. The work of artists often acts as a reflection of the diverse perspectives within a society, facilitating dialogue that can lead to societal progress.On the other hand, there are arguments that this creative freedom should be accompanied by certain government-imposed limitations. Proponents of this view argue that unchecked artistic expression can lead to the spread of harmful content, hate speech, or misinformation, all of which can erode social cohesion and incite violence. In such contexts, government intervention may be necessary to safeguard vulnerable groups and maintain a level of decorum in public discussions.However, the crux of the matter lies in determining the boundary between protection and censorship. Restricting artistic expression can lead to a path where governments might suppress dissent under the pretext of regulation, culminating in a slippery slope towards authoritarian regimes. Historical evidence illustrates that artistic freedom is frequently the first to be compromised in regimes that prioritize control over creative expression, thereby stifling innovation and reducing the depth of cultural expression.In conclusion, while acknowledging concerns about the potential negative consequences of unregulated artistic expression, I firmly believe in the importance of preserving artists' freedom to express their ideas. Rather than enforcing wide-ranging restrictions, governments should cultivate environments that encourage responsible and thoughtful creativity, promoting dialogue and mutual understanding without undermining the integrity of artistic work. Achieving a balance between protecting society and upholding the sanctity of artistic freedom is crucial, given the fundamental role the arts play in human experience and cultural development.
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The discussion about the impact of media on violent behavior has been a longstanding one, spanning decades. On one hand, some people believe that the government should regulate violent content in the media to decrease crime rates, while others argue that this would be an infringement on the right to free expression. In my opinion, although the media does have an influence on societal norms and behavior, the government's control over violent content should be limited and balanced with the rights of individuals.Studies have shown that exposure to violent media can lead to desensitization and the normalization of aggressive behavior, particularly in young people who are easily influenced. This is a legitimate concern when it comes to movies, video games, and TV shows that contain graphic violence. By introducing regulations such as age restrictions and content ratings, the government can protect vulnerable groups from potentially harmful content. Additionally, initiatives that promote media literacy can empower consumers to critically evaluate the content they consume, allowing them to make informed decisions about what they watch or play.However, it's essential to recognize the importance of personal responsibility and the complexity of violent crime. Simply correlating media violence with actual violent behavior ignores other contributing factors such as socioeconomic status, mental health issues, and family environments. Many people consume violent media without engaging in violent behavior themselves. Moreover, excessive government intervention in media content can infringe upon artistic freedom and the fundamental right to free speech, which is vital in democratic societies.In conclusion, while reducing exposure to violent media may contribute to a decrease in violent crime, the government's role should be to provide guidance rather than exert strict control. By promoting responsible media consumption and protecting freedom of expression, society can address the complexities surrounding violence without stifling creativity and individuality. This approach acknowledges the nuances of the issue and seeks to find a balance between the need to protect vulnerable populations and the need to preserve the fundamental rights of citizens.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";The progress made in expanding opportunities for women over the past few decades is a notable sign of societal advancement. Nevertheless, the argument that these gains have created more issues than they have solved is a subject of debate. I strongly disagree with this viewpoint, as the increased opportunities for women have made substantial contributions to social, economic, and cultural growth, despite presenting some difficulties.Throughout history, women's roles were mainly limited to household duties, restricting their involvement in various fields. Nowadays, women have better access to education, professional occupations, and leadership positions, resulting in a more vibrant and inclusive workforce. This empowerment not only benefits women but also enriches society by tapping into a broader talent pool and fostering innovation. A diverse workforce promotes different viewpoints and ideas, leading to enhanced problem-solving and creativity in both business and governance.Furthermore, the increased presence of women in leadership roles has a profound effect on policy-making and community well-being. Women often advocate for issues such as healthcare, education, and family rights, leading to more comprehensive and compassionate societal structures. This shift has also prompted a cultural transformation, wherein traditional gender roles are being questioned and redefined, paving the way for greater acceptance of diversity in all its forms.However, the transition has not been without obstacles. Women still encounter systemic barriers, including wage disparities, underrepresentation in certain sectors, and societal pressures to balance career and family responsibilities. Nevertheless, these challenges are not a consequence of increased opportunities but rather remnants of historical inequalities. Addressing these issues requires continued efforts rather than a reversal of women's rights.In conclusion, the rise in opportunities for women has represented significant progress for society as a whole. Although challenges persist, the benefits of increased female participation in all aspects of life far exceed the problems. Rather than perceiving these changes as negative, society should welcome and support the continued progression toward equality and empowerment for all.
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";The claim that increasing petrol prices is the most effective solution to mitigate growing traffic congestion and pollution problems is a contentious issue. Although it is true that higher fuel costs can deter excessive car use, potentially easing congestion and reducing emissions, I argue that this approach is inadequate and may have detrimental social consequences.Higher petrol prices may encourage individuals to consider alternative transportation modes, such as public transport, cycling, or walking, as the economic principle of price elasticity suggests that rising costs lead to decreased demand. However, this measure unfairly affects low-income individuals who rely heavily on personal vehicles for commuting and may struggle to afford increased fuel expenses. As a result, a straightforward price increase could worsen social inequalities, pushing disadvantaged populations into deeper economic hardship and failing to address the underlying issues of urban mobility and air quality.A more comprehensive approach is necessary to effectively address traffic and pollution problems. Investing in reliable and affordable public transportation infrastructure is essential, as it provides a viable alternative to car travel and reduces reliance on private vehicles. Additionally, designing urban spaces that are pedestrian-friendly and include bike lanes can promote non-motorized transport, contributing to healthier lifestyles and cleaner air.Furthermore, incentivizing the adoption of electric vehicles through subsidies and promoting strict emissions standards for industries and vehicles, coupled with public awareness campaigns about the environmental impact of car usage, could significantly reduce reliance on fossil fuels and drive behavioral change.In conclusion, while increasing petrol prices may offer temporary relief from traffic and pollution, it is essential to adopt a multifaceted approach that prioritizes economic equity and promotes sustainable transportation solutions. By implementing a comprehensive strategy, cities can more effectively tackle the pressing issues of congestion and environmental degradation, ultimately creating a more sustainable and equitable transportation system.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The discussion around banning advertisements is complex and elicits strong emotions from both proponents and opponents. On one hand, some people believe that advertisements are essential for fostering competition and informing consumers, while others argue that they have negative consequences for society. In my opinion, although there are legitimate reasons to restrict certain types of advertisements, a complete ban is not justified.Those in favor of banning advertisements often cite their potential to manipulate people's behaviors and decisions. Many ads are designed to take advantage of people's weaknesses, such as young people or those with low self-esteem, by promoting unhealthy habits like consuming junk food or using harmful substances. For example, ads for tobacco and alcohol products have a significant impact on public health, particularly among young and impressionable populations. In this context, banning these ads could protect people from making harmful choices.Additionally, advertisements contribute to a culture that values material possessions over personal well-being. The constant pressure to consume can lead to financial problems and even mental health issues. By eliminating advertisements, society could promote a healthier environment that prioritizes well-being over consumption.On the other hand, it's crucial to acknowledge the benefits that advertising provides. Ads keep consumers informed about new products, services, and technologies, which encourages competition and can result in better prices and innovations. Moreover, advertisements can be a powerful tool for driving social change by highlighting important issues like sustainability and equality, and encouraging consumers to support meaningful causes.Instead of a blanket ban, a more effective strategy would be to implement regulations on advertising practices. By introducing policies that restrict misleading ads, promote responsible advertising to vulnerable groups, and increase transparency, many of the concerns surrounding advertising could be addressed while still allowing the benefits of advertising to be realized. In conclusion, while some advertisements can be detrimental, a balanced approach that considers both consumer protection and consumer freedom is more desirable than an outright ban.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;"In today's fast-paced world, stress has become a ubiquitous aspect of modern living. As people strive to balance their professional, family, and personal responsibilities, discovering effective relaxation techniques is essential. Among the various stress-alleviating methods available, I firmly believe that physical exercise, mindfulness practices, and connecting with nature are the most potent.Physical activity is a standout stress reliever, as it prompts the release of endorphins, commonly known as ""feel-good"" hormones. For example, a brisk walk or a gym session offers not only a distraction from daily concerns but also a sense of achievement and improved mood. Research substantiates this concept, demonstrating that regular physical exercise can reduce anxiety and promote overall mental well-being. Personally, I have found that incorporating a daily jog into my routine enables me to clear my mind and increase my energy levels, making me more resilient to stress.Mindfulness practices, including meditation and deep breathing exercises, are also highly effective in combating stress. By focusing on the present moment, these techniques allow individuals to disengage from their worries about the past or future. For instance, dedicating just ten minutes daily to meditation can foster a sense of calmness and clarity. Many individuals, including myself, have experienced noticeable benefits from mindfulness, such as reduced anxiety and enhanced concentration.Lastly, reconnecting with nature provides a refreshing escape from daily pressures. Activities like gardening, hiking, or simply spending time outdoors can significantly decrease stress levels. Nature has an inherent calming effect, with studies showing that even short walks in green spaces can enhance mood and reduce feelings of frustration or anxiety. Personally, working in my garden enables me to connect with the earth and find joy in small accomplishments, fostering a sense of peace and contentment.In conclusion, while there are multiple ways to manage stress in modern life, I firmly believe that exercise, mindfulness, and engagement with nature are among the most effective stress-relief methods. By incorporating these practices into our daily routines, we can enhance our overall well-being and equip ourselves to face life's challenges with greater resilience and improved mental health."
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";The communication landscape is undergoing rapid changes, with images, including photographs and films, gaining prominence over written text as a primary means of message conveyance. I generally concur with the notion that visual media has surpassed written expression in modern communication, yet it's crucial to acknowledge the persistent value of the written word.The rise of images as a dominant communication form can be attributed to their capacity to swiftly and universally convey intricate emotions and narratives. A single image can evoke a multitude of feelings, capturing a moment in time that written words often struggle to replicate. For example, iconic images from historical events, such as the fall of the Berlin Wall or the civil rights movement, have had a more profound impact on the public's consciousness than written accounts. Similarly, films can engage viewers in stories and experiences through a combination of visuals, sound, and movement, facilitating an emotional connection that often surpasses that of text alone.The emergence of social media has further amplified the visual-centric nature of modern communication. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok prioritize visual content, indicating a cultural shift towards visual literacy as a primary mode of expression. Content shared in this format is typically more engaging and shareable, resulting in the wider dissemination of ideas compared to lengthy written pieces.Nevertheless, it's essential to recognize the enduring importance of written expression. Literary works, scholarly articles, and even well-crafted social media posts can provide nuanced arguments and context that images often lack. Written communication fosters critical thinking, enabling in-depth exploration of complex subjects.In conclusion, while images have undoubtedly become a more potent tool for communication in the modern era, written text retains its significance. Both forms of expression are complementary, highlighting the multifaceted nature of communication in our society. Ultimately, the interplay between visual and written media will continue to shape the communication landscape, underscoring the importance of embracing both forms of expression.
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;The loss of languages is a critical issue with far-reaching cultural consequences. As numerous languages struggle to survive due to dwindling speaker numbers, a heated debate has emerged over whether governments should provide financial support to preserve them. Advocates for language preservation argue that each language represents a distinct cultural identity and a treasure trove of historical knowledge, encompassing the customs, tales, and values of communities. The extinction of languages signifies a loss of diversity in human experience, and investing in their preservation can not only protect cultural heritage but also foster community cohesion and promote diversity.However, opponents of language preservation funding argue that allocating public funds to support languages with minimal speaker bases may not be a wise use of taxpayer dollars. They suggest that resources should be channeled towards more pressing issues, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. With the increasing dominance of global languages like English, the practical value of preserving minority languages is being questioned. Critics claim that language preservation efforts can become ideologically driven, prioritizing them over more urgent needs.In my view, although the arguments against funding are legitimate, preserving endangered languages is crucial. It's not just about saving words, but about preserving the richness of human culture and ensuring that future generations can access the unique perspectives embedded in these languages. Nevertheless, a balanced approach is necessary, where language preservation funding is combined with strategic initiatives that integrate cultural education with broader social benefits. This approach can ensure that endangered languages receive support while also addressing the pressing needs of the communities that speak them, ultimately striking a balance between cultural preservation and practical considerations.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;The allocation of government funds is often a subject of controversy, with some arguing that expenditures on arts and music are unjustified as they do not contribute to the quality of life in a tangible manner. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that arts and music are essential components of a thriving society and, as such, warrant substantial funding.One of the primary reasons for this is that the arts play a crucial role in shaping cultural identity and fostering community engagement. Through music, painting, and other forms of artistic expression, individuals are able to convey their emotions, beliefs, and experiences. This, in turn, helps to unite communities, promoting social cohesion and understanding among diverse populations. Public art installations and music festivals, for instance, provide residents with opportunities to gather, share experiences, and cultivate a sense of community, thereby profoundly impacting community spirit and social harmony.In addition to their social benefits, participation in arts and music has been proven to have a profound impact on mental health. Engaging in creative pursuits has been shown to reduce stress, alleviate anxiety, and combat depression. Schools that incorporate music and arts into their curriculum often witness improvements in student well-being and academic achievement. By allocating funds to the arts, the government is, in effect, investing in the mental health and well-being of its citizens, resulting in a more content and productive population.It is also important to consider the significant economic benefits of the arts. The arts and culture industries are substantial generators of employment, stimulators of local economies, and attractors of tourism. Cities renowned for their vibrant arts scenes often experience increased economic activity, benefiting local businesses and creating new employment opportunities.In conclusion, while it is true that there are numerous pressing societal needs that require funding, it is essential to recognize the vital role that arts and music play in enhancing the quality of life. Investing in these areas yields stronger, more cohesive communities, improved mental health, and substantial economic benefits. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the continuation of governmental support for the arts, as it is indispensable for the well-being and prosperity of society.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;The question of whether the government should provide funding for healthcare and education is a highly debated issue, sparking intense discussions with strong arguments on both sides. Proponents of government-funded healthcare and education believe that every citizen has a basic right to access these essential services, regardless of their financial situation. They argue that government investment in these areas promotes social equality, provides a safety net for vulnerable populations, and ultimately benefits the economy by improving public health, increasing literacy rates, and creating a well-educated workforce. From this perspective, social welfare programs are seen as investments in the country's future, contributing to a more unified and productive society.In contrast, those opposed to government-funded healthcare and education claim that such policies can result in inefficiencies and a waste of taxpayer money. They argue that government intervention can lead to bureaucratic hurdles that hinder innovation and the effectiveness of service delivery. Some also believe that individuals should be responsible for their own healthcare and education, and that privatized systems, which foster competition, can lead to improved service quality tailored to individual needs. According to this view, government interference could suppress entrepreneurship and private initiatives that might yield better outcomes in both healthcare and education.Personally, I think that while it's crucial to acknowledge the potential downsides of government involvement, the government should still play a significant role in funding healthcare and education. The quality of healthcare and education one receives should not be based on income level. A person's health and education are vital for societal advancement, and therefore, government investment in these areas is not just an expenditure, but a vital investment in the nation's social and economic prosperity. A balanced approach that combines public funding with private initiatives could provide the best solution, reaping the benefits of both methods.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;The concept of zoos has become a highly debated topic, especially in the 21st century, where concerns about ethics and animal welfare have gained significant importance. Some people believe that zoos are no longer justifiable and should be abolished due to the harm they cause to wild animals by keeping them in unnatural environments. On the other hand, some argue that zoos are essential for conservation efforts and educating the public.Personally, I agree that traditional zoos, which keep wild animals in artificial settings, should be reassessed or phased out. Many zoos are unable to provide suitable habitats that meet the complex needs of wild animals, leading to various psychological problems such as depression and anxiety, which can result in abnormal behaviors. In an era where conservation is possible through more humane methods, it seems unreasonable to maintain facilities that prioritize entertainment over animal well-being.Furthermore, advancements in technology provide alternative ways for people to experience and learn about wildlife without compromising animal welfare. Technologies like virtual and augmented reality can replicate natural environments and allow people to interact with animals in a simulated setting, providing an educational experience without the ethical concerns associated with keeping animals in captivity.On the other hand, proponents of zoos argue that they are crucial for functions like breeding endangered species and educating the public about conservation. However, many reputable conservation organizations are now focusing on in-situ conservation, which involves protecting animals in their natural habitats, rather than relying on ex-situ methods like zoos.In conclusion, while there may be a place for specialized sanctuaries or rehabilitation centers that prioritize animal welfare, traditional zoos need to adapt or cease to exist in the 21st century. The well-being of wild animals should be the top priority in a society where compassion and ethical considerations are paramount.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;The correlation between industrial development and environmental deterioration is a pressing issue in modern discussions. Although it is clear that industrialized nations often encounter substantial environmental problems, the claim that environmental harm is an unavoidable result of pursuing a higher standard of living warrants closer inspection.On the one hand, rapid industrialization in pursuit of improved living standards frequently results in environmental issues such as pollution, deforestation, and depletion of natural resources. As industries grow to meet societal demands, they often prioritize economic expansion over sustainability. For instance, the growth of factory production has led to air and water pollution, negatively affecting public health and ecosystems. Countries such as China and India have experienced significant industrial growth but struggle with severe environmental consequences, including toxic air pollution and contaminated water sources.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that environmental degradation is not an inevitable consequence. Advances in technology and increased awareness of sustainability provide opportunities for industrialized countries to achieve economic growth while preserving the environment. Models of sustainable development, such as the adoption of cleaner technologies, renewable energy sources, and waste management systems, demonstrate that it is possible to pursue a high standard of living without harming the planet. Several Scandinavian countries exemplify this balance, maintaining robust economies while prioritizing environmental health through progressive policies and regulations.In conclusion, while many industrialized nations face significant environmental challenges related to their pursuit of a higher standard of living, these issues are not unavoidable. Through deliberate efforts towards sustainability and innovation, it is possible to reconcile economic growth with environmental protection. Therefore, the responsibility lies with policymakers and industries to adopt practices that prioritize both human well-being and ecological integrity, ultimately ensuring a harmonious coexistence between economic development and environmental stewardship.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;A heated debate has been ongoing in contemporary discourse regarding the allocation of government funds, with a specific focus on whether to prioritize public services and facilities or the arts. While it is undeniable that public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure are crucial for the well-being of society, I argue that the arts should not be overlooked, as they play a vital role in enriching culture and driving social development.First and foremost, public services are the backbone of a functioning society, providing the essential framework for health, safety, and education. Nevertheless, the arts make a significant contribution to a nation's cultural identity, fostering a sense of community and shared heritage. The expression of artistic ideas and perspectives gives a voice to diverse experiences, creating a complex and multifaceted tapestry of narratives that is essential for societal unity and cohesion.Furthermore, investing in the arts can yield tangible economic benefits. The creative industry generates employment opportunities, boosts tourism, and can increase property values. Cities that are renowned for their vibrant cultural scenes often attract investments and talented individuals, which in turn drives local economic growth. For example, cities like Austin, Texas, which is famous for its music and arts festivals, reap economic benefits from the influx of visitors and artists, demonstrating that supporting the arts is not only culturally significant but also a pragmatic approach to fostering economic growth.Moreover, the arts promote critical thinking and creativity, skills that are indispensable in an increasingly complex and technologically driven world. Encouraging creativity in educational settings through arts programs can prepare students for the challenges of the future, making them more adaptable and innovative in the workforce.In conclusion, while prioritizing essential public services with government funding is imperative, it is equally crucial to allocate funds to support the arts. The arts enrich society, strengthen the economy, and cultivate a generation of creative and innovative thinkers. Striking a balance between funding for public services and the arts is not only beneficial but necessary for a well-rounded and progressive society.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;The discussion around the ethics of keeping animals in zoos is intricate and has many layers, but my conviction is clear: animals should be allowed to roam free and not be confined to zoos. Although zoos claim to play a vital role in conservation and education, the fundamental rights of animals to inhabit their natural environments take precedence over these arguments.To begin with, wild animals display natural behaviors that are frequently stifled in captivity. In their natural settings, animals engage in hunting, travel long distances, form complex social structures, and nurture their young without human intervention. On the other hand, zoos often house animals in enclosures that are insufficient in terms of size and stimulation. For example, numerous elephants in zoos exhibit signs of psychological distress and stress due to the limited space and scarcity of activities that mimic their natural behaviors, leading to a life of monotony and frustration that negatively impacts their overall well-being.Furthermore, the notion that zoos significantly contribute to conservation is often exaggerated. Although some zoos participate in breeding programs for endangered species, these endeavors rarely tackle the underlying causes of endangerment, such as habitat destruction and poaching. Instead of supporting zoos, we should channel our resources into conservation initiatives that safeguard natural habitats and foster biodiversity in the wild. Organizations focused on preserving habitats and establishing wildlife sanctuaries enable animals to thrive freely while providing a safe haven from human intrusion.Additionally, education can be effectively imparted through methods that do not involve captivity. Immersive technologies like virtual reality and documentaries allow people to learn about animals in their natural environments, cultivating empathy and understanding without imposing confinement on these creatures.In conclusion, despite the arguments presented for the conservation value of zoos, the ethical implications of confining animals cannot be disregarded. Animals have the right to live freely in their native habitats, and it is our responsibility to pursue more compassionate alternatives that prioritize their welfare.
80;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, picture, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?;Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.;The discussion around the freedom of creative artists to express themselves without government interference is multifaceted, sparking questions about personal freedoms, cultural norms, and the influence of art on society. While I generally believe that artists should have the liberty to express their thoughts and ideas, I also recognize the need for certain boundaries to maintain societal standards and safeguard individuals.Artistic expression is fundamental to human interaction and progress, serving as a mirror to society by questioning norms and inspiring transformation. Throughout history, movements in art and literature have driven social advancement, prompting society to reevaluate established beliefs. The works of visionaries like Picasso and filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick have endured through time, challenging societal and political issues. Without the freedom to explore contentious topics, art risks stagnation and fails to represent the diverse experiences of humanity.However, unrestricted freedom may lead to potential harm, as seen in art that perpetuates hatred or advocates for violence, negatively affecting susceptible audiences. In such instances, some level of government oversight may be necessary to safeguard the rights and security of individuals. The key challenge lies in finding equilibrium: while artistic expression must not be suppressed, a framework is required to prevent the misuse of this freedom for promoting detrimental ideologies.In summary, I support a considerable degree of artistic freedom, acknowledging its crucial role in fostering cultural dialogue and innovation. Nonetheless, responsible monitoring should be in place to protect against potential misuses of this freedom. A society benefits from the variety of voices, but it must also prioritize the well-being and safety of its members, ensuring that artistic expression does not compromise the rights and dignity of others.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;The ubiquity of advertising in modern society has a profound impact on our perceptions and consumption patterns, sparking a debate about its overall influence. While some argue that advertising has a positive effect, others claim it has a negative one, and an examination of both viewpoints reveals a multifaceted landscape.On the one hand, proponents of advertising contend that it plays a vital role in the economy and society. Advertising provides consumers with essential information about products and services, enabling them to make informed decisions. A well-crafted advertisement can, for instance, introduce consumers to a new eco-friendly product they may not have known about otherwise. Furthermore, advertising encourages competition among businesses, which can lead to enhanced quality and innovation. As companies vie for customers, they may invest in improved product development and customer service, ultimately benefitting consumers.On the other hand, critics of advertising argue that it often perpetuates materialism and unrealistic expectations. Many advertisements expose consumers to idealized lifestyles that are unattainable, resulting in feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction. For example, beauty product advertisements frequently feature models with flawless skin, contributing to negative body image among viewers. Additionally, some advertisements employ manipulative tactics, targeting vulnerable populations such as children, who may lack the critical skills to distinguish between necessity and desire. This can lead to unhealthy spending habits and a culture of overconsumption.In my view, advertising is a complex phenomenon with both positive and negative consequences. While it has the potential to inform and foster competition, its negative impacts on consumer psychology and societal values cannot be ignored. It is essential for consumers to develop discernment and critical thinking in response to advertising messages, while regulatory bodies should ensure that ethical advertising practices are upheld.Ultimately, a balanced approach that leverages the benefits of advertising while mitigating its negative consequences will best serve society. By doing so, we can harness the power of advertising for good while minimizing its potential harms. This balanced approach will enable us to reap the benefits of advertising, such as informed consumer choices and innovation, while protecting consumers from its negative effects, such as materialism and manipulative tactics.
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;The global discussion on nuclear power has gained momentum as the world struggles to address climate change and the pressing need for environmentally friendly energy sources. On one hand, supporters of nuclear energy argue that it offers a dependable and low-emission alternative to traditional fossil fuels. On the other hand, critics highlight the potential risks associated with nuclear technology. However, I firmly believe that the benefits of nuclear power surpass its drawbacks, particularly in terms of energy security, environmental sustainability, and economic feasibility.First and foremost, nuclear power stands out as a highly effective method for generating substantial amounts of energy while keeping greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum. In contrast to coal and natural gas, which emit considerable amounts of CO2 when burned, nuclear reactors produce electricity through a fission process that does not directly release carbon emissions. This attribute makes nuclear energy a vital component in global efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and alleviate the impacts of climate change.Furthermore, nuclear power is remarkably efficient and can operate continuously over extended periods, ensuring a stable energy supply. Unlike renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, which can be irregular, nuclear power plants can generate energy dependably, thus guaranteeing a consistent supply to meet consumer demands. This dependability enhances energy security, minimizing the risk of power outages and protecting economies from energy price fluctuations.Although critics often mention the catastrophic risks linked to nuclear technology, including accident possibilities and radioactive waste disposal challenges, technological advancements have substantially enhanced the safety of modern nuclear reactors. Moreover, numerous countries have enforced strict regulations to manage waste disposal efficiently.In conclusion, the advantages of nuclear power, including its minimal emissions, dependability, and efficiency, far outweigh its disadvantages. As nations seek cleaner energy alternatives, investing in nuclear technology can significantly contribute to achieving a sustainable energy future, ultimately supporting the fight against climate change.
83;Some people argue that the government should give every unemployed person a mobile phone and should make sure they have access to the Internet. They believe this is the best way of using the public money to reduce the problem of unemployment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.;The suggestion to supply every jobless individual with a mobile phone and guarantee their access to the internet has drawn considerable interest. Although the intention behind this notion is laudable, aiming to support people in finding work and increase their chances of being employed, I have doubts about how effective it would be on its own in dealing with the complicated issue of unemployment.Some people might say that having access to mobile phones and the internet can give jobless individuals more power. In today's digital world, a lot of job applications and conversations happen online. So, giving unemployed people technology could make it easier for them to look for jobs. Also, mobile devices can provide access to online learning, job training programs, and networking sites, which could help people improve their skills and connect with possible employers.However, the main reasons for unemployment often go beyond just having access to technology. Things like the state of the economy, changes in industries, lack of relevant skills, and limits due to location play a big part in deciding if someone can get a job. Therefore, while giving mobile phones and internet access could be part of a wider plan to fight unemployment, it wouldn't work without dealing with these deeper issues.Additionally, the cost to the government should be thought about carefully. Public money could be used better to support training programs that are aimed at specific groups, resources for mental health, or initiatives that teach people about money management, which would deal with the different needs of unemployed people. By putting money into complete programs that improve skills and deal with systemic obstacles, we could tackle unemployment in a more complete way.To sum up, while giving mobile phones and internet access to jobless individuals might have some short-term advantages, it shouldn't be seen as a complete solution for a complicated issue. An approach that deals with the root causes of unemployment and has many parts is necessary for solutions that will last.
84;The use of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras in streets, stations, shops and other public places has increased rapidly in recent years. Although we are told that these cameras help in the fight against crime, some people are opposed to their use. They believe that everyone has a right to privacy. What are your views?;Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.;The increasing installation of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in public areas, such as streets, train stations, and shops, reflects a growing focus on safety and security in society. Proponents of CCTV argue that it plays a significant role in deterring crime, aiding law enforcement in solving cases, and improving overall public safety. Statistics often show a correlation between increased CCTV usage and reduced crime rates, suggesting that surveillance can contribute to a safer environment, particularly in urban areas where crime is more prevalent.However, the rapid expansion of CCTV cameras has sparked concerns about the erosion of privacy rights. Critics argue that the constant monitoring of individuals in public spaces infringes on their personal freedoms and right to privacy, potentially altering their behavior and fostering an atmosphere of mistrust. Furthermore, there are concerns about the potential misuse of footage and unauthorized access to personal data collected by these cameras. Instances of government overreach and surveillance abuse, highlighted by privacy advocates, underscore the need to strike a balance between security and individual rights.In my opinion, while CCTV has significant benefits in preventing and investigating crime, these benefits should not come at the expense of individuals' fundamental right to privacy, which is a cornerstone of democratic societies. A balanced approach can be achieved by implementing strict regulations governing the use of CCTV, including clear guidelines on data storage, access controls, and transparency about camera locations. Regular audits can also ensure that these systems serve their intended purpose of enhancing safety while respecting citizens' rights. Ultimately, a thoughtful and balanced strategy is necessary to reconcile the need for security with the values of privacy and freedom.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;The debate about whether children should grow up in rural areas or large cities is a contentious issue that sparks a wide range of opinions. Although both settings have their unique benefits, I strongly argue that a countryside upbringing offers children a more comprehensive and well-rounded experience.The primary advantage of the countryside is that it provides a safer and healthier environment for children. Typically, rural areas have lower crime rates and less pollution, enabling children to play outside without the constant fear of urban dangers. The abundance of fresh air and green spaces encourages physical activity and outdoor play, which are essential for children's health and development. Research has demonstrated that spending time in nature has numerous benefits for children, including improved mental health, stronger immune systems, and enhanced overall well-being.Furthermore, growing up in the countryside can deepen a child's connection to nature. Children raised in rural areas often develop a profound appreciation for the environment and learn the importance of sustainability and conservation. Their interactions with animals and plants can foster empathy and a sense of responsibility, instilling lifelong values of environmental stewardship that are crucial in today's context of climate change and ecological degradation.In comparison, while cities may provide greater access to educational institutions, cultural diversity, and social opportunities, they also present significant challenges. These include higher living costs, crowded populations, and distractions that can hinder academic and personal growth. The constant stimulation of city life can be overwhelming for children, making it difficult for them to focus and form meaningful relationships.In conclusion, although both rural and urban environments have their advantages, I firmly believe that the benefits of growing up in the countryside, including safety, health, and a connection to nature, outweigh those of city life. By providing a nurturing and peaceful environment, rural living can significantly contribute to a child's overall development and well-being.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";The decision to pursue a career within a company or venture into entrepreneurship is a deeply personal one, influenced by individual preferences, risk tolerance, and professional ambitions. Although both options have their advantages, I firmly believe that, for the majority of individuals, securing a position within a company offers a more stable and fulfilling career path.One of the primary benefits of working for a company is the sense of security it provides, which is often elusive in the world of entrepreneurship. As an employee, one can expect a regular income, health insurance, retirement benefits, and other corporate perks. This financial stability enables individuals to make long-term plans and invest in their personal lives, free from the uncertainty that comes with running a business. For example, start-ups often require a significant amount of time to become profitable, leaving entrepreneurs susceptible to financial difficulties.Furthermore, corporate environments provide opportunities for professional growth that may be harder to come by as an entrepreneur. Companies frequently invest in the development of their employees through training programs, mentorship opportunities, and networking events, allowing individuals to acquire new skills and advance in their careers. The collaborative atmosphere of corporate settings fosters strong professional relationships, which can be invaluable in the long term.On the other hand, entrepreneurship can be extremely rewarding for those with a clear vision and the ability to execute it. The satisfaction of creating something from scratch and enjoying the results of one's efforts is undoubtedly appealing. However, the risks involved are substantial. With around 20% of small businesses failing within their first year, it highlights the challenges and unpredictability associated with entrepreneurship.In conclusion, while both career paths have their unique benefits, I believe that, for most people, working for a company is the preferable option. The stability, opportunities for professional development, and collaborative environment provided by corporate employment offer a more secure and enriching experience compared to the unpredictability and risks of entrepreneurship.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"The phrase ""Never, never give up"" is a potent mantra that underscores the importance of perseverance and resilience in achieving one's objectives. I firmly believe in the validity of this statement, as it is in the face of adversity that our true character is revealed. In a world filled with obstacles and setbacks, the capacity to persevere is not only commendable, but also a crucial element of success.The stories of history's most influential innovators and leaders offer compelling testimony to the power of unwavering determination. For example, Thomas Edison's perseverance in the face of thousands of failures before inventing the light bulb is a testament to the significance of grit and resolve. Had he succumbed to discouragement, countless groundbreaking innovations, literary masterpieces, and pivotal movements may have never seen the light of day. The journey to realizing our aspirations is seldom straightforward, often necessitating the overcoming of hurdles that demand strategic and mental adjustments. When confronted with difficulties, a constructive response involves critically evaluating the situation and maintaining focus on our goals. Surrendering not only stifles growth but also leads to overlooked opportunities for learning and self-improvement. Each setback presents an opportunity to garner valuable insights that can better prepare us for future challenges.It is essential, however, to distinguish between perseverance and obstinacy. There are instances where reassessing our goals or altering our approach is necessary for personal growth or well-being. The core of this mantra lies in combining persistence with adaptability. Thus, while striving relentlessly towards our goals is vital, it is equally important to remain receptive to change and evolution.In conclusion, ""Never, never give up"" stands as a poignant reminder of the transformative power of perseverance and dedication in the face of adversity. When coupled with a willingness to learn, evolve, and adapt, this mindset can pave the path to success, empowering us to transcend challenges and achieve our full potential."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;"The argument over whether to prioritize human needs such as agriculture, housing, and industry or to conserve land for endangered species is highly disputed and necessitates a thorough evaluation of both viewpoints. Although it is essential to acknowledge the need for land to facilitate human progress, I am convinced that preserving habitats for endangered species is equally vital for maintaining the sustainability of our ecosystems.Human endeavors like farming, urban expansion, and industrial growth have a profound impact on the environment. The need for agricultural land to produce food is justified, yet this frequently results in deforestation and the destruction of natural habitats, driving numerous species to the edge of extinction. The loss of biodiversity has far-reaching consequences for ecosystems, affecting food chains and the overall health of the environment. For example, the decline of pollinators like bees, which are crucial for food production, due to habitat loss, highlights that neglecting the needs of endangered species can ultimately jeopardize human interests.Additionally, the interdependence between humans and wildlife should not be ignored. Thriving ecosystems provide invaluable services, including clean air, water purification, and climate regulation. Protecting natural habitats not only preserves endangered animals but also ensures these essential services for future generations. Moreover, preserving biodiversity can support eco-tourism and contribute to local economies, rendering conservation an economically feasible option.In conclusion, while human development requirements are legitimate, they should not be met at the cost of the planet's biodiversity. It is feasible to strike a balance that allows for sustainable development while safeguarding endangered species. Prioritizing conservation efforts is not merely a moral choice; it is a necessity for environmental health and the continued prosperity of humanity. Therefore, I strongly believe that conserving land for endangered animals should be a primary consideration in our development policies."
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";"The saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" is a timeless reminder that outward appearances can be deceiving, and I firmly believe that judging someone based on how they look is misguided. By doing so, we overlook the intricate complexities and inherent worth of each individual.When we first meet someone, it's natural to form an opinion based on their style, clothing, or physical features. However, these surface-level characteristics rarely reflect a person's true personality, values, or abilities. For example, someone who appears disheveled or unkempt may possess exceptional intelligence or a compassionate heart, while someone who presents themselves as polished and put-together may harbor biases or insecurities that undermine their character. Judging based on appearance can lead to premature conclusions, causing us to miss out on meaningful connections with people who don't conform to societal standards of beauty or success.Furthermore, different cultures express identity and individuality in unique ways, and judging based on appearance ignores the diverse backgrounds and experiences that each person brings to the table. The superficial indicators we often associate with success or intelligence are influenced by societal norms that shift over time and perpetuate stereotypes, resulting in a narrow and limited view of humanity. This, in turn, hinders social progress and understanding.On the other hand, taking the time to engage with individuals beyond their physical appearance allows us to discover rich and authentic personalities. By learning about someone's thoughts, experiences, and motivations, we can foster deeper, more meaningful relationships and promote inclusivity. It's essential to recognize that every person has a unique story that deserves respect and acknowledgment.In conclusion, it's crucial to resist the urge to judge others based on how they look. By doing so, we open ourselves up to a world of potential relationships and understanding that transcends superficial evaluations, enriching our lives and fostering a more harmonious and inclusive society."
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;The discussion around adopting a single international language is multifaceted, highlighting the intricate relationship between language, communication, and cultural identity. On one hand, proponents of a universal language believe it would greatly improve global communication, reduce miscommunication, and strengthen international ties. A shared language platform would ease travel, trade, and diplomacy, connecting diverse populations and fostering a sense of global unity. In today's interconnected world, effective communication is crucial, and a single language could streamline interactions in fields like education, business, and technology.On the other hand, opponents raise legitimate concerns about the potential loss of cultural identity that could result from the dominance of a single global language. Language embodies a culture's history, customs, and unique viewpoints, making it more than just a means of communication. The decline of minority languages and dialects, often a consequence of language standardization, can lead to the erosion of cultural heritage and a reduction in the diversity of human experience. Languages are imbued with the stories, humor, values, and perspectives that define their speakers' identities. Therefore, imposing a single language could relegate smaller cultures to a relic status, rather than allowing them to thrive as living traditions.In my view, while a global language offers substantial benefits in terms of efficiency and comprehension, preserving linguistic diversity is essential. Instead of imposing one language on everyone, we should strive for multilingualism, where individuals learn international languages for communication while maintaining their native languages. This approach promotes global citizenship and ensures the world's cultural tapestry remains vibrant. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive world where linguistic diversity contributes to unity, rather than division. Ultimately, embracing multilingualism can help us appreciate the richness of global cultures, while facilitating communication and understanding across borders.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;In today's digital age, fashion trends are constantly evolving, making it difficult for individuals to keep pace. Social media, celebrities, and global events significantly influence what's currently in vogue, with new trends emerging almost weekly. Critics argue that these trends are primarily designed to boost sales in the fashion industry, rather than promote genuine personal style, resulting in a culture that values consumption over individuality.There is considerable validity to the notion that people should dress according to their personal preferences, rather than blindly following transient fashion trends. Clothing is a potent means of self-expression and a crucial aspect of one's identity. When individuals intentionally choose attire that aligns with their personal taste, they are more likely to exude confidence and authenticity. This, in turn, fosters a deeper connection with their surroundings, promoting a sense of belonging and self-acceptance.Furthermore, the fast fashion business model, which encourages incessant consumption, poses significant environmental concerns. The pressure to frequently update one's wardrobe contributes to waste and unsustainable practices within the fashion industry. By resisting the pressure to conform to ephemeral trends, individuals can cultivate a more mindful and sustainable approach to fashion, opting for timeless pieces that reflect their unique style.Ultimately, while fashion trends can provide inspiration and variety, prioritizing personal taste over fleeting trends enables individuals to express their identity more authentically. By embracing their true preferences, rather than succumbing to external pressures, people can develop a fashion sense that is both genuine and sustainable.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";The debate over wealth distribution between rich and poor countries continues to be a highly debated topic in global discussions about justice and fairness. Proponents of wealthy nations sharing their wealth argue that due to past injustices, economic inequalities, and global interconnectedness, there is a moral obligation to help poorer nations. Wealthy countries, which have often benefited from colonialism and exploitative trade practices, have a significant responsibility to address the resulting inequalities that affect developing countries. By providing basic necessities like food and education, these countries can contribute to sustainable development, promoting both short-term relief and long-term growth and stability.However, the argument that the governments of poorer nations should be primarily responsible for their citizens' well-being raises important points. National sovereignty and self-determination are fundamental principles that underpin a country's governance. It is essential for these governments to utilize their resources and capabilities to improve their citizens' lives, rather than relying heavily on foreign aid. This approach promotes accountability and fosters a culture of resilience and innovation within poorer nations. Moreover, it is possible that assistance from richer countries can inadvertently create dependency, undermining local governance and diminishing the motivation for self-sufficiency.In conclusion, while it is crucial for wealthy nations to support poorer nations in addressing pressing issues like hunger and lack of education, the ultimate responsibility lies with the capability and commitment of the governments in these developing nations. A balanced approach, which promotes equitable partnerships that empower local communities while acknowledging the historical and ongoing impacts of wealth disparities, may be the most effective way to achieve global progress. Only through cooperation can both wealthy and poor nations work towards a more just and equitable world, where the benefits of wealth distribution are shared fairly and the gap between rich and poor nations is bridged.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;The distribution of a nation's health budget has been a topic of contention among policymakers, medical professionals, and the general public for a long time. The idea that a substantial portion of health funding should be redirected from treatment to focus on health education and preventive measures is worthy of careful consideration. For several compelling reasons, I generally support this viewpoint.The primary advantage of prioritizing health education and preventive measures is that it can substantially decrease the occurrence of preventable illnesses. By educating the public on healthy lifestyle options, including balanced diets, regular physical activity, and the risks associated with tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, individuals are more inclined to adopt healthier habits. This, in turn, can lead to a decrease in the prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, ultimately resulting in a reduction in the demand for costly medical treatments and hospital stays over time.Another significant benefit of preventive healthcare is that it often involves lower costs in the long term. The financial burden of treating chronic diseases can be substantial, affecting both individuals and the healthcare system as a whole. By reallocating funds to preventive programs and health education initiatives, individuals are empowered to manage their health, and the financial strain on healthcare services is alleviated. This reallocation of resources can contribute to a more sustainable healthcare system, enabling better funding of essential services and interventions.However, it's crucial to recognize the importance of a balanced approach. Although preventive measures are vital, completely diverting funds from treatment could leave vulnerable populations without necessary medical care. Thus, a thorough reassessment of resource allocation is necessary, rather than a complete reallocation of funds.In summary, while emphasizing health education and preventive measures is essential for enhancing public health outcomes, it should be implemented in conjunction with maintaining sufficient treatment services. By embracing a more integrated approach, we can foster a healthier population, reduce healthcare costs, and ultimately improve the overall well-being of society.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;The widespread influence of news media on modern society has become a significant phenomenon, shaping cultures, economies, and individual experiences in profound ways. Nevertheless, the impact of this influence is a subject of debate, with some critics arguing that it has a detrimental effect due to concerns over misinformation, sensationalism, and biased reporting. I concur with the perspective that the consequences of news media's popularity can have far-reaching negative implications.One of the key concerns stemming from the pervasive consumption of news media is the dissemination of misinformation. In the pursuit of online engagement and viewership, numerous platforms often prioritize attention-grabbing narratives over factual reporting. This not only skews public perception but also cultivates an environment of distrust among the citizenry. Consequently, individuals are frequently confronted with a complex web of conflicting information, rendering it increasingly challenging to distinguish between fact and fiction. This has severe repercussions, particularly in situations such as electoral processes or public health emergencies, where informed decision-making is paramount.Furthermore, the emphasis on sensationalism can lead to emotional desensitization. Prolonged exposure to distressing news can induce feelings of anxiety and powerlessness, prompting a disconnection from reality. Individuals may become so overwhelmed by the relentless stream of negative stories that they disengage from their civic responsibilities or community participation, believing their actions to be ineffectual in driving change. This not only adversely affects individual mental well-being but can also contribute to a broader societal indifference toward pressing issues.In conclusion, while news media plays a vital role in informing the public and holding those in power accountable, its popularity often manifests in ways that can be detrimental. The pervasive issues of misinformation and sensationalism compromise the quality of public discourse and hinder meaningful civic engagement. Therefore, I firmly believe that the overall impact of news media's popularity can be regarded as a negative development that necessitates rigorous examination and reform to mitigate its harmful effects.
95;Under British and Australian laws, a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.First and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.Apart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.To conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.;"The practice of keeping an accused person's past criminal history from a jury is a fundamental aspect of the justice systems in the UK and Australia. This is based on the idea that every person accused of a crime deserves a fair trial, without being judged because of their past mistakes. The concept of ""presuming innocence"" supports this, meaning that a person is considered not guilty until proven otherwise, based only on the evidence presented in their current case.Some people argue that juries should be allowed to know about a defendant's past criminal record, as it could provide insight into their character and likelihood of committing the alleged crime. They believe that previous convictions could be relevant in determining the likelihood of the defendant committing another crime, especially in cases involving repeat offenders. However, this viewpoint overlooks the potential risks of introducing past records into a trial.If juries are given access to prior criminal records, it could significantly influence their decisions, leading them to make judgments based on preconceived notions of guilt rather than the facts of the current case. Human psychology plays a significant role in this, as jurors may subconsciously associate past criminal behavior with a higher likelihood of guilt, which undermines the principles of impartiality and fairness that a trial requires. This bias could disproportionately harm the chances of a fair trial outcome, contradicting the principles of justice that the legal systems aim to uphold.In summary, although the intention behind allowing juries to access past criminal records may be to ensure informed decision-making, the potential for bias and unfair prejudice far outweighs any potential benefits. Protecting the integrity of the presumption of innocence and ensuring fair treatment for all defendants should remain the primary goal of the justice system."
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;Global sporting events, especially high-profile competitions like the FIFA World Cup, play a significant role in bringing nations together, fostering a sense of community and friendly competition. These events transcend mere entertainment, functioning as cultural phenomena that can alleviate international tensions and provide an outlet for the expression of national pride in a positive manner. I generally concur with the notion that such events make a substantial contribution to promoting global peace and unity.The primary reason for this is that international sporting events cultivate a sense of global togetherness. During these events, people from diverse backgrounds converge to support their teams, creating an atmosphere of shared enthusiasm and respect. This collective experience often supersedes individual nationalist sentiments, allowing for a shared sense of joy and camaraderie among fans of opposing teams. The World Cup, for example, illustrates that despite political disparities, the universal love for sports can bridge divides and foster mutual understanding. A notable instance of this was the 2018 World Cup, where fans from nations with historically adversarial relationships momentarily united in their passion for the sport, displaying a rare display of solidarity.Furthermore, these events frequently prompt international cooperation and cultural exchange. The hosting of such events prompts nations to invest in infrastructural development, tourism, and diplomatic efforts, which can lead to enhanced international relations. The Olympics, for instance, serve not only as a platform for athletic competition but also as an opportunity for cross-cultural dialogue and exchange between participating nations.However, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of sports in alleviating global tensions. While sports have the potential to unite nations, they can also exacerbate rivalries, leading to conflict. Instances of fan violence or politically motivated protests can overshadow the competitive spirit of these events. Therefore, while sporting events have the potential to ease international tensions, they can also be exploited for less positive purposes.In conclusion, international sporting events, such as the football World Cup, can indeed serve as a catalyst for easing tensions and channeling nationalistic fervor in a constructive direction. Nonetheless, it's essential to recognize that these events are not a universal solution for global discord. Ultimately, they offer a valuable opportunity for nations to engage and understand each other better, but it's equally important to address the challenges that accompany these events.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;The debate surrounding child labor is multifaceted and contentious, with two primary perspectives emerging. On the one hand, opponents of child labor strongly believe that any form of paid employment for minors is a violation of their fundamental rights to a carefree childhood, education, and personal development. They contend that children's places are in schools, not workplaces, where they are susceptible to exploitation and poor working conditions. The adverse effects of child labor on physical health, mental well-being, and academic performance are well-documented and alarming, with research indicating that working children often have to sacrifice their education, thereby perpetuating poverty and limiting their future prospects.On the other hand, proponents of child labor argue that working can provide minors with valuable life skills, such as responsibility, time management, and financial acumen. In many economically disadvantaged countries, working is an economic necessity for families, and can give children a sense of purpose and contribution. When properly regulated and balanced with educational commitments, work experiences can serve as a stepping stone for personal and professional growth.Upon examining both viewpoints, it becomes apparent that while work experience can have benefits, context is everything. Child labor must be strictly monitored to prevent it from coming at the expense of education or well-being. Furthermore, initiatives aimed at supporting children should prioritize their rights and provide them with safe and enriching experiences that promote development without sacrificing their childhood. Ultimately, the question of whether children should engage in paid work is not a simple one, and depends on a range of factors, including the nature of the work, working conditions, and the impact on education and overall development. The challenge lies in ensuring that children have access to safe and meaningful work experiences while protecting their rights to education and leisure, which is crucial to addressing the complex issue of child labor.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;In recent years, there has been a growing trend among countries to encourage high school graduates to take a gap year, either by working or traveling, before starting university. This phenomenon has both positive and negative aspects, influencing the outlook, skills, and futures of young people.One of the main benefits of a gap year is the chance for personal development. During this time, young individuals can acquire valuable life experiences, become more independent, and develop resilience as they face new challenges and environments. Working during the gap year helps them develop crucial skills like financial management and professional competence, while traveling exposes them to different cultures and global perspectives, fostering open-mindedness. Furthermore, these experiences can enhance their job prospects and make them more attractive to future employers and academic institutions.Additionally, a gap year gives young people the opportunity to reflect on their interests and academic passions. Without the pressure of academic grades, they can explore different fields and make a more informed decision about their university studies. This exploration can lead to increased motivation and commitment when they start their formal education.However, there are also downsides to taking a gap year. One concern is the potential lack of structure and direction, which can lead to a decline in academic momentum. Students may struggle to adjust to the demands of university life after a year of relative freedom. Moreover, financial constraints can limit access to travel or work opportunities, disproportionately affecting those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This can widen the gap of inequality rather than narrowing it.In summary, while taking a gap year offers significant opportunities for personal and academic growth, it is crucial to consider the potential drawbacks. Young individuals should carefully weigh these factors to make an informed decision that aligns with their long-term goals and aspirations.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;In today's fast-paced world, the concept of success extends far beyond traditional academic accomplishments. Although universities and other academic institutions provide crucial knowledge and fundamental skills, the traits that lead to genuine success often exceed the boundaries of formal education. I partially concur with the idea that success in modern society cannot be solely achieved through academic means.To begin with, essential qualities like resilience, adaptability, and emotional intelligence are vital for tackling the intricate challenges of the contemporary world. These attributes often develop through hands-on experiences rather than theoretical classroom teachings. For example, adapting to new technologies and fluctuating job markets demands a mindset that welcomes change - a trait that is typically refined through practical engagement in diverse situations rather than theoretical instruction.Furthermore, critical thinking and interpersonal skills are indispensable for success in today's collaborative work environments. While academic programs often foster critical analysis, the refinement of interpersonal communication and teamwork skills frequently occurs in real-life scenarios. Participating in extracurricular activities, internships, or volunteering can nurture these vital abilities, providing lessons that traditional academic curricula may overlook.However, it is crucial not to underestimate the importance of academic institutions. They establish the foundation for knowledge and cognitive skills that are critical to professional success. Certain fields, such as engineering, medicine, and law, rely heavily on extensive education, with universities serving as training grounds for future professionals. Therefore, while some essential qualities for success may be developed outside the classroom, a robust academic foundation remains essential in many career paths.In conclusion, I firmly believe that while universities offer invaluable knowledge and skills, the personal qualities necessary for success in today's world are often developed through life experiences, practical challenges, and interpersonal interactions. Success is a complex and multifaceted concept that benefits from both academic achievement and the intangible qualities developed beyond the classroom.
100;People should be allowed to continue to work for as long as they want to, and not forced to retire at a particular age such as 60 or 65. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society. Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.First and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.Apart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.Admittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.In conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.;The debate about whether individuals should have the freedom to choose when to retire, rather than being forced to stop working at a specific age like 60 or 65, touches on crucial matters of personal autonomy, the changing landscape of work, and the value of experience in the workforce. I firmly believe that individuals should have the right to decide their own retirement age, free from compulsion.Primarily, giving people the option to work for as long as they wish acknowledges their fundamental right to decide how they spend their time. Setting a mandatory retirement age can be viewed as discriminatory based on age, which undervalues the contributions and capabilities of older workers. For many, their career is a source of fulfillment and purpose, and being forced into retirement can lead to boredom, identity loss, and a decline in mental health. The freedom to continue working gives individuals the power to maintain their relevance and pursue their passions on their own terms.Furthermore, the nature of work has undergone significant changes over time. With technological advancements and shifts in workplace environments, older workers can remain productive and competitive long after traditional retirement ages. Many sectors urgently need experienced professionals who can mentor, share their knowledge, and drive innovation. By extending their work life, older adults can enrich not only their own lives but also the organizations they are part of.Moreover, as life expectancy increases, the idea of a fixed retirement age becomes less logical. Many people in their 60s and beyond are healthy, active, and keen to contribute. Restricting them based solely on age is unreasonable and unfair.In conclusion, individuals should have the liberty to work for as long as they desire. This approach respects personal autonomy, utilizes the valuable experience of older workers, and adapts to the realities of contemporary life. Adopting a flexible retirement policy can lead to a more inclusive and productive workforce for everyone.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";"The discussion about the importance of public museums and art galleries in a digital age brings up several key points. Although technology has made it possible for people to view historical objects and artworks online, I believe that physical museums and galleries are still crucial for cultural and educational experiences.One major advantage of physical museums and galleries is that they offer a unique sensory experience that cannot be replicated online. Seeing art and artifacts in person allows visitors to fully appreciate their texture, scale, and emotional impact. For example, standing in front of a famous painting like Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" creates a deep emotional connection that a digital image cannot match. Museums provide a space for reflection, contemplation, and meaningful engagement with art.Furthermore, museums serve as community spaces that encourage social interaction, cultural discussion, and shared experiences. They bring together people from different backgrounds, fostering a sense of community and shared understanding of art and history. While online platforms have their benefits, they cannot replace the role of physical spaces in building community and promoting cultural discourse. Museum programs, such as guided tours and educational activities, also enhance the learning experience, providing visitors with a deeper appreciation of the exhibits.Another critical role of public museums and galleries is preserving cultural heritage. Many historical artifacts are sensitive to light and environmental conditions, and require specialized storage and display to prevent deterioration. Museums provide the controlled environments needed to preserve these artifacts for future generations. As custodians of our collective history, museums play an irreplaceable role in ensuring that our cultural heritage is protected and accessible.In summary, while digital platforms have increased access to art and history, they cannot replace the unique experiences offered by public museums and art galleries. These institutions remain essential for preserving cultural heritage, engaging communities, and providing immersive experiences that contribute to our understanding of human creativity and history."
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;The principle of withholding a defendant's past criminal record from the jury is a cornerstone of both British and Australian legal systems, ensuring a fair trial by upholding the presumption of innocence. This fundamental tenet of justice assumes an individual's innocence until proven guilty, and introducing prior convictions could compromise this principle, leading to biased and prejudiced deliberations.Firstly, the introduction of prior records can distort a jury's perception, clouding their judgment with preconceived notions of guilt based on past behavior. This can lead to an unfair trial, where the focus shifts from the current case to historical misdeeds, undermining the judicial process's integrity. The jury's decision should be based solely on the evidence presented, without being influenced by the defendant's past offenses.Moreover, the justice system's goal of rehabilitating offenders is supported by separating past records from current trials. This separation incentivizes individuals to seek rehabilitation, making positive life changes without fear of being defined by their past. This approach aligns with societal values of forgiveness and second chances, fostering a system that encourages transformation over punishment.In conclusion, excluding past criminal records from jury consideration is crucial for maintaining trial fairness. It prevents bias, upholds the presumption of innocence, and supports the justice system's rehabilitative ethos. Introducing past convictions would likely erode these principles, compromising legal proceedings' integrity. Therefore, I strongly disagree with changing this practice, as it is essential for ensuring accurate and equitable justice.
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;The emergence of the Internet has revolutionized the formal education landscape, particularly with the ability of university lecturers to share their lectures online. This development has sparked a debate about the necessity of attending in-person lectures, with opinions sharply divided on its consequences for students and the future of academic pursuits.In my opinion, the role of the Internet in formal education is multifaceted. On the positive side, it provides unparalleled access to educational materials, allowing students to review course content at their own pace and convenience. This flexibility caters to diverse learning styles and speeds, benefiting students who may struggle in traditional classroom settings. Moreover, it has the potential to make education more inclusive, enabling individuals from varied backgrounds to access high-quality information, regardless of their geographical location.However, the diminished importance of in-person lectures is a cause for concern. Direct interaction with instructors and peers is vital for fostering a sense of community, which is essential for comprehensive learning. In-person interactions facilitate discussions, critical thinking, and immediate feedback, which are often lacking in online formats. Moreover, attending lectures helps students develop crucial communication skills and networking opportunities that are vital for their professional growth.The impact of the Internet on the future of academic study is significant. While it simplifies the dissemination of information and resources, it also poses the challenge of maintaining student motivation and engagement. As online platforms become more widespread, institutions will need to innovate and integrate both online and in-person learning experiences to ensure that the educational process remains engaging and effective.In conclusion, although the Internet enhances access to education, it should not replace the invaluable experiences provided by in-person lectures. A balanced approach that combines the benefits of online resources with the enriching environment of traditional classrooms is crucial for nurturing the next generation of learners. This integrated approach will help students reap the benefits of both online and offline learning, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive and effective educational experience.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;The need for pharmaceutical companies in developed countries to provide affordable medications to those in undeveloped nations is a critical and pressing concern. Millions of people die unnecessarily every year from diseases that could be easily treated with access to essential medicines. The harsh reality is that a lack of access to these medicines in impoverished regions leads to preventable deaths, exposing a significant disparity in global healthcare.Pharmaceutical companies, primarily driven by the pursuit of profit, have the ability to develop life-changing medications and therapies. However, the high prices of these innovations often put them out of reach for those who need them most, particularly in developing countries where incomes are significantly lower. This raises a fundamental ethical question: should profits be prioritized over human lives? In my opinion, these companies have a moral duty to ensure their products are accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or economic situation.A potential solution to this issue could be a tiered pricing system, where the cost of medications is adjusted according to a country's economic status. This approach would allow drug manufacturers to maintain their profit margins while providing affordable access to those who need it most. Furthermore, collaborating with international organizations and NGOs could facilitate the distribution of medicines at reduced prices, ensuring they reach the populations most affected by treatable diseases.Additionally, investing in local pharmaceutical production in undeveloped countries can stimulate economic growth and provide essential medications. Pharmaceutical companies should acknowledge their capacity for social responsibility and take proactive steps to address the accessibility gap in global healthcare. Failing to act would be equivalent to accepting the unnecessary loss of life, a prospect that should be entirely unacceptable in a world that values innovation and compassion.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;The debate about smoking in public and private spaces has sparked intense discussions, with various stakeholders expressing strong opinions. Recently, many companies have implemented smoke-free policies in their offices, and several governments have enforced smoking bans in public areas. I strongly support these initiatives, as they promote healthier environments and a culture of wellness.The implementation of no-smoking policies in offices is particularly beneficial, as it significantly improves the work environment. Secondhand smoke exposure poses severe health risks, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and various cancers. By enforcing smoke-free policies, businesses protect their employees' health and create a more productive workplace. Research has shown that healthier employees are generally more focused and engaged, leading to increased job satisfaction and productivity. Moreover, modern workplaces are increasingly adopting smoke-free policies, reflecting societal shifts towards healthier lifestyles.Government-imposed smoking bans in public places also play a vital role in protecting public health. These policies reduce secondhand smoke exposure for non-smokers, particularly vulnerable groups such as children and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. Public areas like parks, restaurants, and public transportation become more enjoyable and welcoming for everyone. As societal attitudes towards smoking continue to evolve, supporting these bans is crucial for promoting a healthier community.Furthermore, smoking bans encourage smokers to reevaluate their habits. With limited smoking areas available, individuals may be motivated to quit or reduce their smoking, leading to long-term health benefits. Public health campaigns against smoking have shown positive results in decreasing smoking rates, an objective that directly correlates with smoke-free policies.In conclusion, prohibiting smoking in workplaces and public areas is a necessary step towards creating healthier communities. By prioritizing the health of employees and the public, we not only create better environments but also pave the way for a society that values wellness and reduces the stigma surrounding smoking.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";The discussion about the impact of human activities on the Earth is intricate and has many facets. Although humans have undoubtedly made notable contributions that improve the quality of life, such as advancements in medicine, technology, and infrastructure, it is equally crucial to recognize the negative effects these activities have on the environment.One perspective emphasizes the accomplishments of human progress, including significant advancements in healthcare that have substantially decreased mortality rates and increased life expectancy. The unprecedented connectivity provided by technology has facilitated the exchange of information and ideas, promoting education, economic growth, and global understanding. Moreover, urban planning and agricultural innovations have transformed landscapes, providing essential resources like food and shelter to billions of people. These achievements highlight humanity's capacity to adapt and enhance life on Earth.However, another viewpoint presents compelling evidence of the environmental deterioration caused by human activities. The process of industrialization, coupled with deforestation and pollution, has led to climate change, the loss of biodiversity, and irreparable damage to ecosystems. The combustion of fossil fuels significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in global warming, while unsustainable agricultural practices have caused soil erosion and water scarcity. The Earth's natural resources are being depleted at an alarming rate, which threatens the long-term sustainability of our planet.In summary, while human endeavors have undoubtedly enhanced certain aspects of life on Earth, the broader perspective reveals a critical reality: many of these advancements come at a substantial environmental cost. The priority now is to find a balance, utilizing our capabilities to improve the quality of life while also adopting sustainable practices that protect the planet. Ultimately, it is essential to acknowledge that harming the Earth jeopardizes our very existence and to work collectively towards fostering a more harmonious and sustainable relationship with our environment.
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The discussion about retiring high-level employees over 55 to make way for younger generations is complex and has many sides. Some people think that encouraging older employees to retire would create opportunities for new talent, but I disagree with this approach because it undervalues the important contributions and expertise that experienced professionals bring to organizations.One key point is that older employees have a lot of experience that can greatly benefit any company. High-level employees usually have a deep understanding of their industry, which they have developed over years of dealing with challenges and changes. This knowledge can guide younger employees and create a culture of mentorship and learning, which can lead to innovation and growth. For instance, senior executives can share valuable insights on making strategic decisions and managing crises, which are hard to gain through only academic or entry-level experience.Moreover, having a mix of ages in the workplace can enhance creativity and problem-solving. Teams with people of different ages can approach challenges from various perspectives, resulting in comprehensive solutions that benefit the entire organization. Often, a synergy forms between younger and older employees, where the energy of youth combines with the wisdom of age, creating a dynamic work environment that thrives on collaboration.Furthermore, forcing older employees to retire or pressuring them to step down raises ethical concerns. Companies should appreciate their employees' contributions and offer flexible work arrangements that allow those over 55 to continue working, possibly in mentorship roles or part-time positions. This benefits not only the employees, who can stay active and engaged, but also the companies that can utilize their vast experience.In summary, rather than encouraging older employees to retire, companies should promote an inclusive workplace that values contributions from individuals of all ages. Age diversity can drive innovation, and the experience of senior employees can be the foundation for developing the next generation of leaders.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;The issue of controlling the media has become increasingly significant in the digital age, where information is easily accessible and constantly being shared. There are two opposing views on this matter: one advocating for stricter media control to prevent the dissemination of false information, protect national security, and maintain social unity, and the other pushing for fewer restrictions to promote freedom of speech and allow individuals to access a wide range of perspectives. My personal stance is in favor of easing media controls to facilitate greater access to information.The primary reason for this stance is that the foundation of democracy relies heavily on the unrestricted flow of information. Overregulation of the media can hinder its ability to facilitate public discussion and informed decision-making, which are essential components of a democratic system. By enabling a broader range of voices to be heard, citizens can form opinions based on a variety of viewpoints, which is crucial for fostering a healthy, pluralistic society where diverse perspectives can coexist and contribute to the national conversation.Furthermore, strict media control can lead to censorship, creating an atmosphere of fear instead of encouraging constructive criticism. Historically, authoritarian regimes have utilized media control to suppress dissent and manipulate public opinion. In contrast, an informed public can challenge injustices and positively influence governance.Nonetheless, it is essential to improve media literacy among the public to combat misinformation. Rather than imposing strict controls, governments and educational institutions should focus on teaching individuals critical thinking skills and how to distinguish between credible and unreliable sources.In conclusion, while there is a need for accountability in the media, a balanced approach that promotes freedom of expression alongside media literacy is crucial. Loosening media controls can empower individuals, foster a more informed and engaged society, and ultimately benefit democracy as a whole. This approach allows for the free flow of information, which is vital for a healthy democracy, and enables citizens to make informed decisions based on a variety of perspectives.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;The debate surrounding the extent of a citizen's responsibilities, is a multifaceted and complex issue. While paying taxes can be viewed as a fundamental civic obligation, providing essential funding for public services like healthcare, education, and security, thereby benefiting the greater good, some argue that citizenship encompasses a broader spectrum of responsibilities. These responsibilities extend beyond mere financial contributions and include active engagement in societal matters, such as participating in local governance, casting votes, volunteering, advocating for social causes, and nurturing community bonds. Such comprehensive civic engagement is vital for fostering a robust and responsive democracy, where citizens can express their values and priorities, and leaders are held accountable. In essence, merely fulfilling tax obligations does not fully encapsulate the role of a citizen in their community. Active civic participation is essential for building social cohesion, reinforcing communal bonds, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility among community members. Engaged citizens play a pivotal role in shaping policies and advocating for change, ensuring that their needs, and those of their community, are being met. Ultimately, it is the synergy between tax payments and broader civic engagement that yields a well-rounded and thriving society. An enlightened citizen recognizes that, while tax payments are indispensable, active civic involvement is what truly enriches a community, making it more equitable, vibrant, and just. This involvement is crucial for a flourishing democracy, where every individual's voice is valued and heard, thereby ensuring the prosperity and advancement of society as a whole.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;The use of animals in testing has been a highly debated topic among scientists, ethicists, and animal rights advocates for a long time. In my opinion, animal testing should be outlawed due to moral concerns, the availability of alternative testing methods, and the questionable accuracy of results obtained from animal tests.The primary reason for this stance is the significant ethical implications associated with using animals for experimental purposes. Like humans, animals are capable of feeling pain, suffering, and emotional distress. It is inherently inhumane to subject them to painful procedures, confinement, and lethal experiments. The notion that animals exist solely for human benefit is rooted in an outdated, human-centered perspective that disregards the inherent value of other living beings. As our understanding of animal sentience grows, it becomes increasingly evident that using animals for testing purposes is morally unjustifiable. Therefore, laws and regulations should reflect societal moral values and prohibit such practices.Furthermore, the field of scientific research is undergoing significant transformations. Advances in technology have made numerous alternative testing methods available, such as in vitro testing, computer simulations, and organ-on-chip technology. These innovative approaches can effectively replace animal experimentation, eliminating the associated ethical dilemmas while often providing more relevant and applicable results to human biology. This, in turn, increases the success rate of medical research.Another crucial aspect to consider is the reliability of animal testing. Research has shown that many drugs that pass animal tests fail in human trials due to issues with safety and efficacy. This discrepancy highlights that relying on animal models is not only morally wrong but also scientifically ineffective, resulting in wasted resources and potential harm to human health.In conclusion, animal testing should be prohibited. Moral concerns, emerging alternative methodologies, and the questionable validity of animal testing results all point to the need for a fundamental change in our approach to scientific research. A society that values humanity and progress should prioritize ethical standards that respect the well-being of all living beings while advancing scientific knowledge.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";Traditional assessment methods, which have long been the foundation of educational evaluation, have typically involved formal, written exams. However, the effectiveness of this approach has been increasingly debated. Although standardized tests can measure a student's knowledge and comprehension, I argue that they are not the best way to evaluate academic achievement.There are several limitations to traditional exams. Firstly, they mainly test a student's ability to recall information under timed conditions, which can unfairly penalize students who have knowledge but struggle with exam anxiety. This approach neglects essential skills like creativity, problem-solving, and applying knowledge in practical situations - skills that are highly valued in the current job market. For example, a student may excel in collaboration, innovation, and critical thinking, but perform poorly on a traditional exam due to the stress of time-limited assessments.Moreover, the emphasis on written exams can unintentionally promote memorization over in-depth understanding. Students may focus on memorizing facts to pass exams rather than engaging critically with the material, leading to knowledge gaps once the exam is completed. This undermines genuine learning and the development of lasting knowledge.It is also crucial to consider the diversity of learning styles. Not all students learn effectively through written exams. By incorporating alternative assessment methods, such as project-based evaluations, presentations, and group work, a broader range of student abilities can be demonstrated, and a more inclusive learning environment can be fostered. These methods can capture essential collaborative skills, promote authentic interest in the subject matter, and provide a more comprehensive picture of a student's abilities.In conclusion, while traditional exams offer a standardized assessment method, they fail to adequately reflect the full range of a student's learning and capabilities. A more multifaceted approach to assessment, incorporating a variety of methods, would provide a more accurate evaluation of academic achievement and better prepare students for the complexities of the modern world.
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;The obstacles hindering development in impoverished nations are often rooted in historical injustices, economic disparities, and systemic inequalities. To overcome these challenges, it is essential for these nations to prioritize advancements in health, education, and trade. However, it is equally crucial for wealthier nations to acknowledge and fulfill their responsibility in supporting these efforts. The interconnected nature of the global economy, combined with the moral imperative of wealthier countries, demands a more proactive and collaborative approach to assisting less affluent nations.Achieving better health outcomes is vital for sustainable development, as poor health can significantly undermine productivity and exacerbate cycles of poverty. Wealthier nations can make a substantial contribution by investing in healthcare infrastructure, providing specialized medical expertise, and supplying critical resources such as vaccines and essential medicines. Such initiatives not only enhance the health and wellbeing of citizens in poorer countries but also promote a global sense of unity and cooperation.Education plays a similarly critical role in empowering individuals and driving societal transformation. The governments of wealthier countries can provide indispensable support for educational initiatives, including funding scholarships for students from poorer nations, facilitating programs for teacher training, and sharing educational materials and technologies. An educated population is better equipped to address economic challenges, leading to a more prosperous and resilient global community.Trade offers another significant avenue for advancement. Wealthier nations should strive to establish fair trade policies that prioritize the needs and opportunities of poorer countries, enabling them to access global markets and compete on a level playing field. This can be achieved by reducing tariffs, streamlining regulatory frameworks, and providing support to local industries in developing nations.Ultimately, the onus of supporting development should not fall exclusively on the poorer nations. Wealthier countries must recognize the critical importance of collaborative efforts aimed at improving health, education, and trade. By actively supporting these areas, they not only meet their moral obligations but also contribute to the development of a more equitable, prosperous, and interconnected global society.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;"The idea that the growing use of computers in education will eventually make teachers unnecessary is a topic of debate. Although technology is undoubtedly crucial in modern education, I firmly believe that it cannot completely replace the role of teachers.One key reason for this is that teachers offer a unique personal touch that technology is unable to match. They are more than just providers of information; they also offer guidance, emotional support, and motivation. The ability of teachers to assess a student's understanding, adjust their teaching to meet individual needs, and encourage critical thinking is vital for creating an effective learning environment. For example, a computer program can provide information, but it cannot empathize with a student's difficulties or celebrate their successes, which are essential parts of the learning experience.Furthermore, education is about more than just transferring knowledge; it also involves personal and social development. Teachers play a vital role in creating a sense of community in the classroom, facilitating discussions, promoting teamwork, and helping students develop interpersonal skills. These skills are essential for success in the future and cannot be developed through computer-based learning alone.While technology can improve the learning experience by offering personalized learning, immediate feedback, and access to a wide range of resources, it should be seen as a tool that complements teaching rather than replacing it. Technologies such as virtual simulations, online assessments, and educational software can enrich the curriculum, but they are most effective when used by skilled teachers who can put the content into context and make it more relatable.In conclusion, as computers become more integrated into education, the role of teachers should change and adapt rather than become less important. Teachers will remain essential in guiding, mentoring, and inspiring future generations, demonstrating that technology and human interaction can coexist effectively in the classroom."
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;The modernization of agriculture has led to a significant increase in food production and a reduction in costs, thanks to the use of advanced fertilizers and machinery. However, these benefits are offset by concerns about the negative impact on human health and the environment. The use of improved fertilizers, particularly synthetic ones, has revolutionized agriculture by allowing crops to absorb essential nutrients more efficiently, resulting in higher yields and lower prices. Similarly, the introduction of advanced machinery has streamlined farming processes, reducing labor costs and increasing productivity.At first glance, these developments seem to benefit both farmers and consumers. Nevertheless, the widespread use of chemical fertilizers poses a significant threat to human health, as they can contaminate groundwater and cause health problems such as respiratory issues and cancer. Moreover, the overuse of fertilizers can lead to nutrient runoff into water bodies, causing ecological imbalances like algal blooms, which can harm humans and wildlife. The mechanization of farming also has socio-economic consequences for local communities. The replacement of manual labor with advanced machinery can lead to job losses and a decline in rural livelihoods, exacerbating economic disparities as wealth becomes concentrated among those who can afford the technology. In conclusion, while improved fertilizers and machinery can increase food production and affordability, they also pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Therefore, it is crucial to adopt a balanced approach that prioritizes sustainable agricultural practices and safeguards the well-being of all stakeholders, ensuring that advancements in farming benefit society as a whole without compromising health and environmental integrity. 
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;The age-old question of whether government funding should be allocated to artists or other vital sectors has ignited a heated debate in modern society. Although it is indisputable that areas such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure warrant significant financial backing, I strongly advocate for the equal importance of investing in the arts for a well-rounded society.Primarily, art serves as a cornerstone of cultural identity and expression, reflecting the values, experiences, and traditions of a community, while fostering unity, tolerance, and cross-cultural understanding. By supporting artists, governments can cultivate a thriving cultural landscape that boosts civic pride, attracts tourism, and yields substantial economic benefits. For instance, cities like Florence and Paris, celebrated for their rich artistic heritage, draw millions of visitors each year, generating considerable revenue for their regions.Furthermore, art plays a pivotal role in driving innovation and creativity across various sectors, including technology, education, and beyond. The artistic mindset encourages novel thinking, out-of-the-box problem-solving, and the development of innovative ideas. By prioritizing funding for the arts, governments can foster creative industries that contribute to job creation, economic expansion, and societal progress. A case in point is the burgeoning video game industry, which relies heavily on artistic talent and has emerged as one of the fastest-growing sectors globally.On the contrary, some posit that limited government resources should be channeled towards pressing social concerns, such as poverty and health emergencies. While these issues are undoubtedly pressing, it is essential to acknowledge that a thriving artistic culture can effectively address social problems. Artists often utilize their work as a platform to raise awareness about social injustices, stimulate meaningful dialogue, and inspire positive change.In conclusion, I firmly believe that government funding for the arts is an essential investment, rather than an extravagance. By allocating resources to support artists, governments can nurture cultural expression, inspire innovation, and address pressing social issues. A balanced approach that values both the arts and essential public services is vital for a thriving, well-rounded society.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The rapid advancement of technology has drastically altered our daily lives, presenting both benefits and environmental drawbacks. As a result, a contentious debate has emerged regarding the most effective strategy to address environmental concerns: adopting a more simplistic lifestyle or leveraging technology to drive innovation.Those in favor of a simpler lifestyle argue that the comforts of modernity have led to excessive resource consumption and increased pollution. They propose that embracing simplicity enables individuals to decrease their environmental impact. Recommended actions include minimizing waste, reducing energy consumption, and opting for locally sourced products. This approach emphasizes a return to traditional practices and a more natural way of living, which can lead to a more sustainable coexistence with the environment. By relying less on technology, proponents believe that emissions can be reduced and resources conserved.Conversely, many are convinced that technology itself possesses the solution to environmental issues. Breakthroughs such as renewable energy, electric transportation, and eco-friendly agricultural methods showcase potential solutions to minimize our ecological footprint. These technological advancements can optimize resource utilization and provide cleaner alternatives to conventional systems. Furthermore, innovations in recycling technologies and carbon capture can mitigate and even reverse existing environmental damage.In my view, a balanced approach is crucial. While simplifying our lifestyles can significantly contribute to environmental sustainability, technology also plays a vital role in tackling the pressing environmental challenges we face. By implementing environmentally friendly technologies and promoting mindful consumption, a synergistic effect can be created, amplifying our efforts to protect the planet. Ultimately, the choice is not between one approach or the other, but rather combining both strategies to foster a sustainable future. By integrating technological innovation with a commitment to simplicity, we can lay the groundwork for a healthier environment.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The vast salaries of professional athletes and entertainers often ignite heated discussions about the value of their contributions in comparison to those in crucial professions. Critics argue that the substantial earnings of football players, musicians, and actors are excessive, especially when compared to the modest compensation received by essential workers such as teachers, nurses, and other vital service providers.A key factor contributing to this pay disparity is the inherent nature of the entertainment industry and professional sports, which rely heavily on consumer demand and corporate sponsorships. For example, popular athletes can secure lucrative contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, not only for their performance, but also for their ability to significantly boost the revenue of leagues and franchises. The NFL, for instance, generates billions of dollars in annual revenue, with star players drawing in substantial viewership and sponsorship deals, making them invaluable assets to their teams. This raises questions about whether the entertainment industry should take precedence over essential services.Teachers, who play a crucial role in shaping the future by educating young minds, often earn modest salaries, with dedicated educators in the United States earning around $50,000 annually. This is in stark contrast to the astronomical paychecks of athletes like Patrick Mahomes, who signed a 10-year, $450 million contract. This disparity highlights a societal imbalance in how we value different professions. Moreover, critical workers such as healthcare professionals often work under immense pressure and long hours, particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, yet their compensation remains relatively modest.The glorification of celebrity culture further exacerbates these financial inequalities. As society places a high premium on entertainment, the compensation for athletic and entertainment figures continues to skyrocket. While they undoubtedly contribute to cultural experiences and joy, their inflated salaries raise concerns about misplaced priorities and the potential neglect of more impactful professions. Ultimately, the argument persists that the earnings of professional athletes and entertainers are out of proportion, particularly when weighed against the essential work of those in the public service field. The question remains: should the value of entertainment surpass that of essential services, or is it time to reassess our priorities?
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;"The significance of computers and the Internet versus traditional schooling in a child's education is a highly relevant topic in today's technology-driven world. Those in favor of digital learning believe that online resources provide unparalleled opportunities for independent learning, offering a vast array of information, educational videos, and interactive tutorials that may not be available in traditional classrooms. This flexibility enables children to learn at their own pace, delve deeper into topics of interest, and develop technological proficiency - a skill deemed essential for success in the modern world.On the other hand, proponents of traditional schooling stress the vital role of teachers, structured learning environments, and the social aspects of education. Schools offer more than just academic knowledge; they provide crucial social skills, emotional support, and the ability to work collaboratively. Trained teachers can identify and cater to the diverse needs of students in ways that artificial intelligence and automated systems cannot. Additionally, schools foster a sense of community, helping children develop vital interpersonal skills.In my view, a balanced integration of both digital and traditional learning methods is essential for effective education. While the Internet is a valuable supplement to traditional curricula, it cannot replace the comprehensive benefits offered by teachers and schools. A blended approach that combines digital resources with classroom learning can provide a well-rounded education, preparing children academically, socially, and emotionally for life's complexities. Ultimately, finding a balance between these two educational methods will equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in a digital world while maintaining essential human connections."
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";The use of capital punishment as a means of justice is a highly debated topic, with proponents and opponents presenting strong arguments for and against its implementation. On one hand, supporters of capital punishment believe that it serves as a deterrent to violent crime, as the fear of execution may prevent individuals from committing heinous acts. They argue that the existence of the death penalty can lead to a significant reduction in serious crimes, such as murder, and that the severity of the punishment conveys societal condemnation of such acts.On the other hand, opponents of capital punishment contend that it is an inhumane and ineffective means of controlling crime. They point to studies that suggest the death penalty does not deter crime more effectively than life imprisonment without parole, and that factors such as socio-economic conditions, mental health issues, and lack of education play a more significant role in criminal behavior. Furthermore, the risk of wrongful convictions and the irreversible nature of the death penalty raise significant ethical concerns.Rather than relying on capital punishment, it is argued that society should focus on preventive measures that address the root causes of violent crime. Initiatives in education, mental health support, and community development could lead to meaningful reductions in crime rates, creating a safer society without resorting to state-sanctioned death. In conclusion, while capital punishment may have its proponents, the evidence suggests that it is not a reliable means of controlling violent crime. Instead, comprehensive strategies that tackle the underlying issues contributing to violence should be prioritized, providing a more effective and humane approach to justice.
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;The idea that companies should do whatever it takes to make a profit is highly debated and sparks a variety of viewpoints. Although making a profit is a key goal for any business, how this goal is achieved is important and should be considered alongside ethical, social, and long-term sustainability factors.Some argue that in a capitalist system, companies must prioritize profit to survive in a competitive market. Without profits, companies cannot afford to operate, pay employees, or innovate. This perspective believes that companies have a duty to maximize profits for their stakeholders, including shareholders and employees. Successful companies also contribute to the economy, create jobs, and drive technological advancements by reinvesting their profits.On the other hand, prioritizing profit above all else can lead to unethical practices and a disregard for social and environmental responsibilities. Companies that focus solely on profit may exploit workers, harm the environment, or use deceptive marketing tactics. These approaches can damage a company's reputation and erode public trust. As consumers become more aware, many prefer to support companies that demonstrate integrity and social responsibility. This shift suggests that a more balanced approach, where profit and ethics coexist, may lead to better long-term outcomes.In fact, companies that prioritize social responsibility often enjoy stronger customer loyalty and higher employee satisfaction. These companies create a positive cycle where ethical practices and profitability thrive together, contributing to a healthier economy and society.In summary, while profit is a crucial objective for businesses, it should not come at the expense of ethical standards and social responsibility. A sustainable business model recognizes that long-term success is best achieved by balancing profit motives with the broader interests of society.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;I am thrilled to hear about the plans for a new high school in my neighborhood, as it brings numerous benefits that I strongly endorse. As a fundamental aspect of community growth, education plays a vital role, and the introduction of a new high school is expected to significantly improve the quality of educational opportunities for local students.One of the primary advantages of the new high school is that it will help reduce overcrowding in existing schools. In many neighborhoods, students are packed into classrooms with limited resources, which can impede their ability to learn effectively. The new high school will provide a much-needed solution to this problem, enabling smaller class sizes and more personalized attention from teachers. This enhanced learning environment will be crucial in promoting better academic results for students.Furthermore, the new high school is likely to increase community involvement and support. With more local teenagers attending school in their own neighborhood, parents and residents are likely to become more engaged in school events, such as sports and academic competitions. This increased participation will help build a stronger sense of community, foster relationships among families, and create a supportive network for students.The new high school will also create opportunities for partnerships with local businesses and organizations, leading to expanded programs, internships, and resources for students. These collaborations will not only enhance the educational experience but also prepare students for the workforce by providing them with practical skills and real-world experiences.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the construction of a new high school in our neighborhood is a welcome development. It has the potential to enhance educational quality, strengthen community bonds, and provide students with valuable opportunities for personal and professional growth. Supporting this initiative is in line with the broader objective of investing in our youth and ensuring they have access to the resources they need to thrive.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;The debate surrounding whether parents or adult relatives should make significant decisions on behalf of their teenage children, aged 15 to 18, is multifaceted and contentious, with compelling arguments on both sides. Nevertheless, I primarily disagree with the notion that parents should be the primary decision-makers, as I firmly believe that while guidance from parents is indispensable, it is equally crucial to empower teenagers to make their own decisions, thereby fostering autonomy, independence, and critical thinking skills.The late teenage years, a period of significant personal development, are pivotal for adolescents as they begin to establish their identities, values, and beliefs. If parents or adult relatives assume control over decision-making, it may impede their capacity for critical thought and responsibility for their choices. Permitting teenagers to make decisions, even if they result in mistakes, is a vital component of personal growth, as it enables them to learn invaluable lessons and develop essential life skills. This stage is crucial for building confidence and preparing them for the challenges of adulthood.Furthermore, the rapidly evolving nature of the world means that the challenges faced by teenagers today are distinct from those encountered by previous generations. As a result, it is essential for teenagers to develop the ability to navigate these changes independently. By making their own decisions, they cultivate critical problem-solving skills and resilience, traits that are fundamental to achieving success in their future academic, professional, and personal pursuits.On the other hand, the importance of parental guidance cannot be overstated. Parents possess a wealth of life experience and wisdom, which can provide a valuable framework for decision-making. However, this guidance should be delivered through a collaborative approach, rather than a dictatorial one. By engaging in open discussions and allowing teenagers to express their thoughts and opinions, parents can assist their children in weighing their options without inhibiting their ability to make their own choices.In conclusion, while parental guidance is essential for teenagers, it is equally beneficial to allow them to make their own significant decisions. By striking a balance between guidance and autonomy, teenagers can develop into more responsible and confident individuals, equipped to face the challenges of the world as adults.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;The notion that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life is a common sentiment, often shared by those who nostalgically reflect on their early years. However, it's essential to recognize the complexity and diversity of human experiences, as this statement may not be universally applicable. While I agree that childhood can be a time of unparalleled joy and innocence, I also acknowledge that it's not a one-size-fits-all experience.Childhood's charm lies in its inherent sense of wonder, imagination, and curiosity. The world is a vast, unexplored territory, full of possibilities, where children can find joy in simple activities like outdoor play, making friends, and discovering nature's beauty. This carefree exploration fosters creativity, curiosity, and cherished memories that can last a lifetime. Moreover, childhood is often characterized by a lack of responsibilities and the absence of adult pressures, leading many to perceive it as a carefree period.Nevertheless, it's crucial to recognize that childhood is not always a joyful experience for everyone. Many children face significant challenges, such as poverty, abuse, or family instability, which can cast a shadow over their early years and leave lasting emotional scars. Research indicates that adverse childhood experiences can have a profound impact on mental health, suggesting that for some, childhood may be a time of hardship rather than happiness. As a result, while some individuals may look back on their childhood with fondness, others may bear emotional scars that can permanently influence their outlook on life.In conclusion, the reality of childhood is multifaceted, marked by both positive and negative experiences that shape individuals in unique ways. Ultimately, happiness is a subjective and personal experience, and the nature of childhood can vary greatly from one person to another, making it challenging to universally declare this phase as the happiest time of life.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;Attending college or university is a personal decision driven by a complex array of motivations, ambitions, and life circumstances. However, three key drivers stand out: the desire for knowledge, career progression, and personal growth.The pursuit of knowledge is a primary motivator for many students. Institutions of higher learning offer unparalleled access to a wide range of academic subjects, expert instructors, and extensive resources, all of which facilitate intellectual exploration and development. For example, someone with a passion for environmental science may choose to attend university to delve deeper into subjects like climate change, sustainability, and conservation ecology. This in-depth academic exploration enhances one's understanding of the world, while also cultivating critical thinking and analytical skills that are indispensable in any professional field.Career advancement is another significant reason individuals enroll in higher education. Many careers necessitate not only specialized knowledge but also specific credentials that can only be obtained through formal education. For instance, those aspiring to careers in healthcare, engineering, and teaching typically must complete specific undergraduate or graduate degree programs to meet licensure requirements or secure employment. Moreover, in the competitive employment landscape of today, holding a college degree is often a prerequisite for securing stable, well-paying positions.Lastly, colleges and universities also function as environments for personal development. These institutions offer students the opportunity to evolve socially and emotionally through participation in extracurricular activities, which teach valuable skills such as teamwork, leadership, and time management. Furthermore, the diverse college and university environments expose students to a multitude of perspectives, thereby enhancing their comprehension of cultural diversity and social issues. Engagement in activities such as debate clubs or volunteer work sharpens communication skills and fosters empathy and social consciousness.In summary, the reasons for attending college or university are multifaceted, spanning the pursuit of knowledge, career ambitions, and personal development. Each motivation underscores the diverse opportunities presented by higher education, emphasizing its crucial role in equipping individuals for professional achievement and a fulfilling life.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;The importance of friendship has been a topic of discussion for a long time, with many people wondering whether it's better to have a small number of close friends or a large number of acquaintances. In my opinion, having one or two very close friends is more valuable than having many casual friends. This is because close friends provide emotional intimacy, support, and deeper relationships.One of the main reasons for this is that having a small number of close friends allows for deeper emotional connections. When friendships are meaningful, people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, fears, and goals without fear of being judged. This creates a strong bond between friends, allowing them to understand each other on a deep level. On the other hand, casual acquaintances often only provide superficial interactions that lack the depth needed for meaningful support during difficult times.Another reason is that close friends offer more substantial emotional support. When people are going through tough times, it's invaluable to have someone who is genuinely invested in their well-being. Close friends are more likely to be there for support, offering comfort and guidance, whereas acquaintances may not have the commitment or understanding to provide meaningful help.Furthermore, interacting with close friends is often more fulfilling than the shallow interactions that come with casual relationships. Having deep conversations and shared experiences with a few close friends can lead to lasting memories and a stronger sense of belonging.In summary, while having a large social network can have benefits, the emotional richness, meaningful support, and satisfaction that come from having one or two close friends far outweigh the advantages of having many casual acquaintances. Close friendships not only make our lives richer, but also have a positive impact on our mental and emotional health, making them extremely valuable throughout our lives.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";In the modern era, it is often asserted that life has become more convenient and enjoyable compared to the experiences of our grandparents during their childhood. I firmly believe in the validity of this statement, as significant strides in technology, healthcare, and societal evolution have collectively transformed daily life, rendering it more accessible and pleasant.The primary factor contributing to this transformation is the technological revolution, which has profoundly altered the manner in which we live and work. The widespread availability of the internet, smartphones, and various appliances has simplified numerous daily tasks. For example, communication has become virtually instantaneous, with the ability to connect with loved ones worldwide in mere seconds through text or video calls, vastly improving upon the traditional methods of letter writing and landline phones that our grandparents relied upon, which often entailed waiting periods of days or weeks for a response. This ease of communication serves to enhance and nurture relationships that were previously challenging to maintain.Furthermore, advancements in the healthcare sector have led to a substantial enhancement in our quality of life. The evolution of medical technology has enabled faster and more accurate diagnoses, as well as the development of effective treatments that were previously unavailable. The implementation of vaccinations and improved public health policies has resulted in a notable decline in the prevalence of infectious diseases that were common during our grandparents' childhood. Consequently, they faced health challenges that are now either preventable or treatable, thereby experiencing greater overall health risks.Additionally, shifts in societal norms have played a crucial role in making life more comfortable. The redefinition of gender roles and the pursuit of equality have led to increased access to educational and employment opportunities. Unlike our grandparents, who may have encountered limitations based on their gender or socio-economic status, individuals from diverse backgrounds can now pursue their aspirations with greater freedom.In conclusion, life in the present day, characterized by its technological advancements, improved healthcare, and progressive societal norms, is unequivocally easier and more comfortable than it was for our grandparents. These developments not only serve to enhance our daily experiences but also empower us to lead lives that are healthier and more fulfilling.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;High schools should offer students the flexibility to select courses that align with their interests and strengths, providing a more personalized and engaging learning experience. In today's specialized world, permitting students to explore subjects that match their aspirations can significantly boost their motivation and enthusiasm for learning.A key benefit of allowing students to choose their courses is that it promotes autonomy, responsibility, and a sense of ownership over their educational journey. When students are empowered to make informed decisions about their academic path, they are more likely to be committed to their studies and develop critical thinking skills. Moreover, students who are passionate about their courses tend to perform better academically, leading to higher achievement levels and greater satisfaction.Tailoring the curriculum to students' interests can also prepare them for their future careers. By giving students the opportunity to take courses relevant to their intended professions, they can gain a competitive edge in a world that increasingly values specialized knowledge and skills. For example, a student interested in environmental science can benefit from courses in biology, chemistry, and policy-making, setting them up for success in their future studies and careers.However, it is crucial to maintain a balance between elective courses and mandatory foundational subjects, ensuring students receive a well-rounded education. While students should have the freedom to explore their interests, core subjects like mathematics, science, and humanities should remain compulsory to provide them with essential skills.In summary, granting high school students the freedom to choose their courses can lead to more motivated and responsible learners. By combining personal interest with a solid academic foundation, students are better prepared for success in higher education and their future careers, making this approach a vital development in educational practices.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";In the midst of today's frenzied world, where deadlines loom, meetings abound, and tasks pile up, many individuals find themselves perpetually rushing to keep pace. While some thrive in this chaotic environment, feeding off the energy of a packed schedule, I strongly advocate for a more leisurely approach to life. Embracing a slower pace, I firmly believe, yields numerous benefits for our mental health and overall well-being.The first advantage of adopting a slower pace is that it allows us to develop a profound appreciation for the nuances of our surroundings. When we're in a hurry, we often gloss over the beauty inherent in mundane moments - a flower blooming, the sound of a child's laughter, or the awe-inspiring sight of a sunset. For instance, during a solitary stroll through the park, I've noticed that the slower my pace, the more I'm able to take in. I observe families enjoying picnics, artists capturing landscapes on canvas, and birds singing their hearts out. These petite pleasures enrich my existence and fill me with a sense of joy that I might otherwise overlook in my haste.Additionally, a slower pace of life facilitates the cultivation of mindfulness and a significant reduction in stress levels. The act of relishing our experiences can lead to enhanced mental clarity and bolstered emotional resilience. By allocating time to reflect on our daily undertakings or engaging in relaxing pursuits like reading or meditation, we grant ourselves the opportunity to replenish our mental energy reserves. Personally, I've incorporated a morning meditation ritual into my daily routine, which has left me feeling more centered and adept at navigating life's challenges.Moreover, embracing a slower pace of life encourages more profound connections with those around us. In our rush to accomplish everything, we often neglect meaningful conversations or let opportunities to nurture relationships slip by. Taking the time to engage with friends and family, whether through shared meals or casual outings, fosters stronger, more resilient bonds and nurtures our emotional well-being.In conclusion, while a frenzied lifestyle may be suited to some, I am a strong proponent of a more thoughtful, intentional approach to living. By embracing a slower pace, we can cultivate mindfulness, appreciate the beauty that surrounds us, and foster meaningful, lasting connections with others, ultimately leading to a more rewarding and fulfilling life.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;The tourism industry is a multibillion-dollar sector that significantly contributes to global economic development, creating millions of job opportunities and generating substantial revenue for local, regional, and national economies. However, the industry's financial benefits are offset by its detrimental impact on local environments and cultures, which necessitates careful consideration.The economic benefits of tourism are undeniable. It generates employment opportunities in sectors such as hospitality, transportation, and entertainment, which in turn reduces unemployment rates and enhances living standards. Many countries rely heavily on tourism as a primary source of income, utilizing tourist revenue to fund infrastructure and public services like education and healthcare. Furthermore, tourism facilitates cultural exchange and understanding by allowing visitors to engage with local customs and lifestyles, thereby fostering deeper intercultural relationships.On the other hand, the environmental consequences of mass tourism are alarming. Overcrowding in popular destinations often results in pollution, habitat destruction, and depletion of natural resources. For example, beaches become littered with waste, and fragile ecosystems are disrupted by the influx of tourists. Moreover, the cultural implications of tourism cannot be ignored, as the commercialization of local customs and traditions to cater to tourists poses a risk of cultural dilution, leading to a loss of authenticity and identity. Traditional practices are altered solely for the sake of tourism, compromising their originality.In conclusion, while tourism is a vital economic driver, it is crucial to achieve a balance between economic gains and the preservation of local environments and cultures. Adopting sustainable tourism practices that prioritize ecological conservation and respect for local heritage is vital to ensure that the benefits of tourism are not achieved at the expense of environmental or cultural integrity. By promoting responsible travel and encouraging eco-friendly practices, it is possible to support local economies without compromising their unique landscapes and traditions, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and responsible tourism industry.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;The distribution of government funds between public services and the arts is a highly debated topic, evoking strong feelings on both sides. Although some argue that public services, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, should take precedence over the arts, I firmly believe that a balance between the two is essential, with the arts playing a vital role in society that warrants considerable funding.Public services are undoubtedly essential for the well-being of citizens, and adequate funding is necessary to ensure quality healthcare, safe transportation, and accessible education. However, the notion that funding the arts is a frivolous expenditure ignores the significant benefits that arts and culture bring to society. Engaging with the arts encourages creativity, cultural understanding, and critical thinking - all of which contribute to a more informed and cohesive society.Furthermore, investing in the arts can have substantial economic benefits. The cultural sector often stimulates local economies, creates jobs, and attracts tourism. Cities with a thriving arts scene tend to draw visitors, resulting in increased spending in local businesses. Government investment in the arts promotes a sense of community and belonging, enhancing the quality of life for all citizens.Additionally, the arts serve as a reflection of society, allowing individuals to explore complex social issues and emotions. They provoke thought, inspire dialogue, and reflect diverse cultures and experiences, thereby enriching our collective consciousness. It is crucial to acknowledge that funding for the arts is not a wasteful expense, but rather an investment in societal development.In conclusion, I firmly believe that while public services should remain a priority, the arts also deserve a significant share of government funding. By supporting both, we cultivate a well-rounded society that values creativity alongside essential services, ultimately fostering a healthier, more inclusive, and dynamic community.
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";The notion of a single, lifelong career is becoming increasingly outdated in today's fast-paced and interconnected world. The swift advancement of technology and globalization has transformed the nature of work, resulting in the emergence of diverse and dynamic career paths. Instead of following a traditional, linear career trajectory, individuals are now exploring multiple avenues for financial gain and personal fulfillment throughout their lives.A key driver of this shift is the rapid evolution of industries, primarily fueled by technological innovations. Many jobs that exist today may become obsolete in the near future, requiring individuals to adapt to new roles and sectors. As a consequence, the capacity to be agile and embrace change has become crucial. Workers are now expected to develop a versatile skill set that can be applied across various fields, leading to a more adaptable approach to career development.Furthermore, the gig economy has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional employment, offering individuals the opportunity to engage in freelance work, side hustles, or entrepreneurial pursuits alongside their primary careers. This diversification of income sources enhances financial stability and allows for greater exploration of personal interests. For example, an individual may work as a software developer during the week while pursuing a passion for photography on the weekends. This blending of professions can lead to a more enriching and fulfilling life.Another vital aspect of this evolving career landscape is lifelong learning. Ongoing education, whether through traditional institutions or online platforms, enables individuals to acquire new skills and knowledge relevant to various fields. This approach fosters adaptability, encourages personal growth, and aligns with the modern workforce's demand for continuous development.In conclusion, the traditional concept of a single career is giving way to a multifaceted approach, where individuals pursue multiple careers and prioritize lifelong learning. In today's dynamic world, this newfound flexibility presents exciting opportunities and a pathway to personal and professional fulfillment.
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;The role of computers in modern society has sparked a heated debate, with opinions sharply divided. On the one hand, some people believe that computers do more harm than good, arguing that over-reliance on technology can have negative consequences such as reduced face-to-face interactions, erosion of social skills, and increased distractions. For example, students who constantly multitask on multiple devices may find it challenging to focus on their studies, which can negatively impact their academic performance. Moreover, the widespread use of computers in the workplace can lead to an unhealthy balance between work and personal life, as the lines between professional and personal spaces become increasingly blurred.On the other hand, many people believe that computers are essential tools that boost productivity and enhance the quality of life. In the workplace, computers simplify operations, enabling tasks to be completed more efficiently. They also facilitate global communication, making remote work a viable option for many individuals. Additionally, in the education sector, computers provide access to a vast array of information and learning resources, enabling students to engage with course materials in innovative ways that were previously unimaginable. The ability to collaborate through online platforms fosters teamwork, innovation, and collective productivity, highlighting the potential of technology to elevate performance.In my view, while it is crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of computer use, the benefits significantly outweigh the disadvantages. Rather than perceiving computers as obstacles, it is vital to adjust our approach to technology. This involves promoting digital literacy, ensuring that individuals can navigate the online world in a healthy and productive manner. By leveraging the benefits of computers while being aware of the potential pitfalls, society can foster a balanced relationship with technology, ultimately leading to personal and professional development. Therefore, instead of rejecting technology, we should strive to integrate it thoughtfully into our daily lives, maximizing its potential to enhance our lives.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;The ongoing debate about the importance of social skills compared to formal qualifications has become a prominent issue in today's job market. Employers are divided in their opinions, with some stressing the significance of social skills, which enable effective communication, teamwork, and adaptability in various social situations, ultimately contributing to a positive work environment. In roles that involve frequent interactions, such as sales and customer service, social skills can be just as crucial as, if not more important than, academic qualifications. They facilitate collaboration, improve client relationships, and shape a company's culture.However, others argue that traditional qualifications and technical expertise are still the foundation of professional success. They believe that formal education and certifications demonstrate a candidate's knowledge, expertise, and ability to perform specific tasks. Certain fields, including engineering, medicine, and finance, require advanced qualifications to ensure employees meet industry standards and regulations. The increasing complexity of many jobs also demands a strong educational foundation, which can only be obtained through formal training.In my view, while qualifications are undoubtedly essential, social skills should not be overlooked. The modern workplace is increasingly collaborative, requiring employees to not only perform their tasks efficiently but also to interact positively with others. An employee who excels in both qualifications and social skills is more likely to contribute to an organization's success. Instead of prioritizing one over the other, employers should adopt a more comprehensive approach when evaluating candidates. By considering both academic and interpersonal aspects, companies can develop a workforce that is skilled, adaptable, and capable of thriving in dynamic environments.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;The discussion about the direction of charitable organizations - whether to provide aid locally or globally - has been a topic of dispute. Those in favor of global aid believe that resources should be allocated based on the level of need, without considering geographical boundaries. They argue that poverty and suffering are universal issues, and that assisting the most disadvantaged individuals, regardless of their location, is a moral imperative. This perspective promotes global unity and compassion, encouraging donors to acknowledge that crises like famine and conflict are not confined to national borders. In today's interconnected world, individuals are encouraged to view themselves as part of a global community, where assistance should be provided based on need rather than nationality.On the other hand, proponents of local charity argue that the focus should be on addressing issues within one's own country. They believe that local charities are often better positioned to understand the social complexities, cultural nuances, and specific needs of their communities. Local organizations can also foster trust and empowerment among beneficiaries, as they are more familiar with the problems faced by their neighbors. Concentrating on domestic needs can also stimulate local economies and drive community development, promoting a locally-driven approach to solving social problems.In my view, while both perspectives have validity, charitable organizations should aim for a balanced approach. Global issues such as climate change, pandemics, and displacement require international cooperation, whereas local problems demand immediate attention. Charities can benefit from adopting a dual strategy, where they raise awareness and funds for pressing global crises while simultaneously investing in their local communities. By doing so, they can ensure a more comprehensive approach to alleviating suffering, thereby fulfilling their mission effectively and ethically. Ultimately, resolving societal issues requires both local and global efforts, advocating for a unified response to humanitarian needs. 
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;"The discussion about whether students learn more from teachers or from other sources like the internet and TV is a significant one in education. In my opinion, students in schools and universities learn much more from teacher-led lessons than from other resources.The main reason for this is that teachers create learning experiences that are tailored to their students' specific needs. Unlike the internet, which is a vast but often overwhelming and unfiltered source of information, teachers curate the content they present, making it coherent and aligned with learning objectives. They are skilled at breaking down complicated ideas into manageable parts, using a variety of teaching methods to cater to different learning styles. This ensures that all students can understand the material effectively.Additionally, lessons taught by teachers encourage interactive learning, which promotes engagement and critical thinking. In a classroom, students can ask questions, take part in discussions, and work together on projects. This kind of dynamic interaction is often missing from passive learning environments like watching TV or doing research on the internet, where there's little feedback and students might not fully understand what they're learning.What's more, teachers are not just about delivering information; they're also role models and mentors. They motivate students to explore their interests and overcome challenges in their studies. The personal bond between teachers and students creates a supportive environment that's crucial for both academic and emotional development. This personal element is something that online platforms can't replicate.To sum up, while the internet and TV can be useful additional resources, they don't have the same personalized, structured, and interactive qualities as lessons taught by teachers. That's why I firmly believe that students benefit more from the direct teaching and guidance provided by teachers than from other sources. The mix of expertise, engagement, and personal connection that teachers offer is priceless for student learning and achievement."
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";Global sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup, significantly contribute to reducing international tensions and provide a healthy outlet for nations to express their patriotism. I concur with this viewpoint for several compelling reasons.Primarily, these events offer a global stage where nations unite, despite their competitive nature. The FIFA World Cup, for example, attracts a worldwide audience, fostering a shared experience that bridges cultural and political divides. The excitement surrounding these tournaments enables fans to channel their national pride in a positive manner, cheering on their teams amidst a celebratory atmosphere. This sense of camaraderie promotes cross-cultural understanding and appreciation, cultivating a sense of global unity.Furthermore, international sporting events frequently provide a temporary reprieve from geopolitical strains. During the Olympic Games, for instance, nations with strained relations can momentarily put aside their differences and focus on the competitive spirit. The symbolic gesture of athletes competing together under a unified banner serves as a poignant reminder of shared human values, aspirations, and objectives - broadening our understanding of our collective existence.Also, sports facilitate dialogue through shared interests. Fans from opposing teams often engage in amicable discussions about the game, fostering a congenial atmosphere that helps alleviate misconceptions. Such interactions humanize competitors, reminding us that individuals from disparate nations share analogous hopes and aspirations.In summation, while international sporting events may not eradicate deep-seated conflicts, they undoubtedly create an atmosphere where international tensions can be alleviated, and national pride can be expressed in a healthy manner. Leveraging this energy for the greater good can foster positive interactions amongst nations, thereby contributing to a more peaceful and harmonious world.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;The popularity of distance learning programs has surged in recent years, driven by their flexibility and accessibility. Nevertheless, a debate persists about their effectiveness in comparison to traditional university or college education. In my opinion, distance learning offers substantial educational advantages, despite having some limitations.A major benefit of distance learning is its accessibility, which enables students to learn at their own pace and create their own schedule. This is particularly advantageous for individuals juggling work, family, or other commitments. As a result, people who may not have had the chance to pursue higher education otherwise can now do so. Furthermore, the plethora of online resources, including lectures, interactive materials, and discussion forums, allows students to personalize their learning experience according to their needs and preferences.Distance learning programs also frequently utilize state-of-the-art technology, enhancing the learning experience. Interactive platforms and multimedia content create a more engaging learning environment, often resulting in improved information retention. The global aspect of online education fosters diverse perspectives, enabling students to interact with peers from varied backgrounds and cultures, thereby enriching their learning experience.However, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of distance learning. The absence of face-to-face interaction may impede the development of interpersonal skills typically acquired in traditional settings. Additionally, students may struggle to stay motivated and disciplined without the structured environment of a physical classroom. Traditional university attendance often provides benefits like networking opportunities, mentorship, and the overall college experience, which distance learning may lack.In conclusion, although distance learning has its drawbacks, I firmly believe it can provide significant educational benefits, especially for those who cannot pursue traditional education pathways. Ultimately, the decision between distance education and university attendance should be based on individual circumstances and learning preferences, as both options have unique strengths to offer.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;The extinction of numerous species has become a pressing concern in the modern world, with diverse perspectives on how to tackle this issue. On one hand, some people advocate for the protection of endangered species, while on the other hand, others believe that human issues should take priority. It is essential to consider both viewpoints, as the relationship between human existence and biodiversity is intricate and multifaceted.Supporters of conservation efforts argue that the loss of biodiversity has severe consequences for ecological balance. Every species has a unique role in its ecosystem, and its extinction can have a ripple effect, disrupting food chains and leading to further environmental degradation. Moreover, many endangered species provide significant benefits to humans, including medicinal resources, pollination, and water purification. Protecting these species is also seen as a moral obligation, given the significant contribution of human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change to their decline. Therefore, safeguarding these animals is both an ecological necessity and a matter of ethical responsibility.In contrast, those who prioritize human concerns argue that resources and efforts should be focused on pressing human challenges, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. They contend that addressing human needs should be the priority, as it directly affects the quality of life and societal stability. The argument is that while biodiversity is important, it should not overshadow the immediate needs of human survival and development. Furthermore, some argue that as human populations continue to grow, conservation efforts may be seen as secondary to ensuring human well-being.In my opinion, both perspectives are valid, but a balanced approach is crucial. Sustainable development is key to addressing human needs while protecting biodiversity. For example, adopting eco-friendly practices can ensure that conservation efforts benefit both humans and wildlife. Ultimately, the survival of our species is inextricably linked to the health of our environment, making it imperative to find a balance between nurturing human needs and preserving the ecological systems on which we all depend.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;The issue of whether universities should implement equal admission quotas for male and female students across all disciplines is a multifaceted and intricate matter that requires thoughtful examination. Although the principle of gender equality is fundamental, the execution of such quotas presents several concerns that need to be taken into account.On the one hand, advocating for equal representation in university admissions promotes fairness and ensures that female students have the same opportunities as their male counterparts, particularly in fields where they have been underrepresented, such as engineering and computer science. This initiative has the potential to break down persistent societal disparities, foster diverse perspectives in academic and professional settings, and create a more balanced environment. By doing so, universities can contribute to a society where both genders make equal contributions to various fields, ultimately leading to enhanced creativity and problem-solving abilities.On the other hand, enforcing equal numbers of male and female students in each subject may compromise the fundamental principle of merit-based admissions. Ideally, admissions should be based on individual qualifications, interests, and capabilities, rather than strict adherence to gender parity. Implementing quotas may inadvertently lower academic standards and undermine the achievements of students who have earned their admission based on merit. Moreover, certain subjects may naturally attract more students of one gender due to cultural, social, or individual preferences, and a rigid quota system could disrupt the natural distribution of interest across disciplines. This could lead to discontent among students who feel pressured to conform to arbitrary ratios rather than pursuing their genuine interests.In conclusion, while striving for gender equity is crucial, enforcing equal numbers of male and female students in every subject may not be an effective approach. A more effective strategy would involve creating an inclusive environment that encourages students to pursue their interests, while also implementing supportive measures to increase the participation of underrepresented genders in specific fields, all without compromising academic integrity. This approach would allow universities to promote gender equity while maintaining the principles of meritocracy and academic excellence.
140;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The rise of digital communication has sparked a timely debate about the superiority of face-to-face interaction over other methods, such as written correspondence, email, or phone calls. I strongly believe that face-to-face communication reigns supreme due to its instantaneous nature, emotional resonance, and capacity to forge authentic connections.One of the primary advantages of face-to-face communication is its ability to facilitate immediate interaction and clarification. Real-time conversations enable individuals to swiftly address misconceptions or queries, while non-verbal cues like body language and facial expressions play a vital role in guiding the conversation's flow and ensuring accurate message conveyance. For example, subtle nods or frowns can add context to spoken words, enriching the dialogue in ways that digital communication cannot match. This immediacy allows for more effective and efficient communication.Furthermore, face-to-face communication boasts an unparalleled emotional depth. The physical presence of individuals creates an intimate atmosphere, fostering deeper connections and more meaningful relationships. In-person conversations transcend mere words, enabling us to experience empathy and understanding through our shared humanity. In contrast, digital conversations often lack the personal touch, making it easier to misinterpret emotions or intentions. The absence of visual and tactile elements can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.Moreover, face-to-face interactions have the potential to yield more productive brainstorming sessions and collaborations. When individuals gather in person, the exchange of ideas flows more naturally, sparking creativity and innovation that may be stifled in slower, written communications. The synergy that arises from in-person interactions can lead to more effective problem-solving and decision-making.In conclusion, while digital communication methods offer convenience, they often lack the richness, clarity, and emotional connection that face-to-face interactions provide. Engaging fully with another person in real-time leads to better understanding, stronger relationships, and more effective collaboration. Therefore, I advocate for a greater emphasis on in-person communication in an increasingly virtual world, where the value of face-to-face interaction should not be underestimated.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;The significant increase in human lifespan resulting from advancements in medical care is a notable accomplishment that highlights our progress in science and technology. Nevertheless, it is vital to weigh the pros and cons of this trend and consider whether its drawbacks outweigh its advantages.On the positive side, a longer life gives people the opportunity to experience life more fully. Thanks to better healthcare, many individuals can enjoy healthier and longer lives, which enables them to pursue their passions, continue learning, and spend quality time with loved ones. This enrichment of personal lives also contributes to the greater good of society, as older adults can share their valuable knowledge and experience. From an economic perspective, a healthier and older workforce can boost productivity, as seasoned workers often possess unique expertise that is hard to replace.On the other hand, the extension of human lifespan poses substantial societal and economic hurdles. The growing aging population puts increasing strain on healthcare systems and social services. As people age, they are more likely to encounter chronic health problems that necessitate ongoing medical care, thereby overburdening available resources. Furthermore, pension schemes may become unsustainable due to the decreasing number of working individuals supporting a rising number of retirees, which could lead to economic inequality and potential funding crises.Additionally, there are concerns regarding the quality of life as it is extended. Living longer does not guarantee a life devoid of suffering or disability. Many people may endure prolonged periods of decline, requiring substantial care without regaining adequate physical or mental wellbeing. This situation raises ethical questions regarding end-of-life care and the preservation of dignity.In summary, while advancements in medical care have undeniably led to increased lifespan, the potential drawbacks - including the strain on healthcare and pension systems, coupled with concerns about the quality of life - present considerable challenges. Therefore, it is crucial for society to find innovative solutions to ensure that longer lives are not only possible but also healthier and more fulfilling, thereby achieving a balance between acknowledging the accomplishments and addressing the difficulties associated with increased life expectancy.
142;Successful people do something new or take risks rather than only doing something they know how to do well. AGREE OR DISAGREE.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.Admittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";In today's fast-paced world, it's clear that successful individuals often achieve greatness by venturing into unexplored territories and taking calculated risks, rather than just relying on their existing skills. I strongly believe that exploring new horizons fosters personal growth and paves the way for remarkable accomplishments.To begin with, risk-taking is essential for innovation. Many groundbreaking discoveries were made by individuals who dared to step out of their comfort zones. For example, Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, transformed the tech industry by combining creativity with risk-taking, resulting in revolutionary products like the iPhone. Jobs' willingness to experiment and navigate uncertainty enabled him to create new markets and change consumer behaviors. This demonstrates that success often stems from a willingness to explore the unknown.Furthermore, engaging in new pursuits helps develop crucial skills for success in today's competitive environment. The ability to adapt and learn quickly is invaluable across various industries. Those who limit themselves to their existing strengths may find their skills becoming outdated due to technological advancements and societal changes. In contrast, individuals who take risks by trying new roles or projects are more likely to develop a diverse skill set, making them more resilient in the workforce.Lastly, exploring new territories fosters resilience and a growth mindset. Viewing failure as a learning opportunity encourages perseverance, a trait embodied by successful individuals. Through trial and error, they gather valuable insights that can ultimately lead to greater success.In summary, the link between taking risks, exploring new paths, and achieving success is unmistakable. Embracing change and uncertainty drives innovation and equips individuals with the tools needed to thrive in a constantly evolving world. Therefore, instead of relying solely on familiar skills, aspiring individuals should embrace new challenges as a pathway to success.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;The discussion about access to higher education has become a central theme in modern discourse, highlighting the contrast between education for all and admission based on achievement. One faction argues that every individual, regardless of their academic record, should have the chance to attend college or university. They believe that education is a basic right that can give people power, promote fairness, and help them move up the social ladder. From this viewpoint, higher education is seen as a way to improve society and encourage innovation, with the idea that diverse learning environments lead to more engaging conversations and deeper insights.On the other hand, supporters of a merit-based system think that only students who show academic excellence should have access to higher education. They argue that this ensures students are well-prepared for the challenges of advanced learning. This perspective prioritizes the quality of education, suggesting that upholding high standards is crucial for the integrity of academic institutions and the value of their degrees.Although both perspectives have valid points, I personally believe that higher education should be available to everyone. Education plays a vital role in developing potential, and reducing barriers to entry can lead to surprising discoveries and innovations from individuals who may not fit traditional academic expectations. Moreover, not all students demonstrate their abilities through conventional testing or grading methods. By allowing a wider range of students to access higher education, society can tap into diverse talents and viewpoints that would otherwise go unutilized.In summary, making higher education equally available to all promotes a society where everyone can contribute to the collective knowledge and progress of humanity. While academic standards are important, creating opportunities for access can ultimately lead to a more informed and innovative society, benefiting everyone.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The debate about whether universities should focus their spending on upgrading facilities or recruiting famous professors is complex, but I tend to agree that investing in better facilities can have a greater impact on the university experience than hiring well-known faculty members.Upgrading facilities, especially in practical fields, can greatly improve the quality of education. State-of-the-art labs with modern technology enable students to participate in hands-on learning, which leads to a deeper understanding of their subjects. Access to cutting-edge resources such as specialized software, equipment, or modern study areas creates an environment that encourages innovation and creativity. When students have access to the necessary tools, they are more likely to achieve academic success and prepare effectively for their future careers.Furthermore, well-maintained and modern facilities can attract a diverse range of students seeking these resources for their education. Even the most skilled teachers may struggle to provide a high-quality educational experience without adequate resources. Investing in facilities can have a positive impact on the entire institution, enhancing its reputation and leading to better student outcomes, which in turn attracts more talent, both among students and faculty.On the other hand, while prominent professors can certainly enhance a university's reputation and provide valuable insights, their effectiveness often depends on the environment in which they teach. A renowned teacher may not be able to perform at their best if they are limited by outdated infrastructure or poorly maintained facilities.In summary, while both faculty and facilities are essential to a university's success, investing in modern facilities can offer more significant long-term benefits. By prioritizing investments in upgraded facilities, universities can create enriching learning environments that ultimately benefit students, faculty, and the institution as a whole.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;I firmly believe that high schools should grant students the autonomy to pursue the courses that genuinely interest them. By doing so, we empower them to take charge of their educational journey, ignite their passion for learning, and foster a deeper commitment to academic excellence.The benefits of student-directed learning are multifaceted. Firstly, when students are given the liberty to choose their courses, they are more likely to develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for their academic path. This, in turn, motivates them to invest more time and effort into their studies. For example, a student with a passion for the arts can thrive in an environment that offers classes in painting, graphic design, or other creative pursuits, rather than being restricted to traditional subjects that fail to resonate with their interests. This autonomy not only enriches their high school experience but also equips them with the decision-making skills necessary for success in higher education and their future careers.Furthermore, the freedom to choose courses enables students to nurture their passions and acquire a more nuanced understanding of the subjects that captivate them. A student fascinated by technology, for instance, can opt for courses in coding, robotics, or other related fields, thereby developing skills that align with their career aspirations. By focusing on areas that genuinely interest them, students can explore, deepen their knowledge, and potentially drive innovation in their chosen fields.Moreover, research has consistently shown that students who are invested in their coursework exhibit higher levels of academic engagement, leading to improved grades, better retention rates, and enhanced overall performance. When students are given the opportunity to select courses that align with their interests, they are more likely to be motivated, dedicated, and committed to achieving academic excellence.In conclusion, providing high school students with the freedom to choose their courses is crucial for cultivating an educational environment that is engaging, personalized, and motivational. By empowering students to pursue their passions, we not only prepare them for future success but also foster a lifelong love of learning, equipping them with the skills, knowledge, and motivation necessary to thrive in an ever-evolving world.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;The notion that games are solely for children is a common misconception. In reality, I firmly believe that games play an equally important role in the lives of adults. Engaging in gaming activities offers a multitude of benefits that go far beyond mere entertainment, including the promotion of mental well-being, social connections, and cognitive development - all of which are essential for a healthy and balanced adulthood.One of the primary advantages of gaming for adults is its ability to provide a significant outlet for stress relief. In today's fast-paced world, where responsibilities and challenges abound, adults are increasingly susceptible to high levels of stress and anxiety. By participating in games, whether it be video games, board games, or sports, adults can find a much-needed escape from the pressures of everyday life, facilitating relaxation and mental rejuvenation. Research has demonstrated that engaging in gaming activities can lead to reduced anxiety levels and improved mood, allowing adults to recharge and refocus.Moreover, games offer a valuable means of fostering social interaction, a crucial element of a healthy lifestyle. In an era where busy work schedules often leave adults feeling isolated, games provide a unique opportunity for connection and community building. Online multiplayer games enable friends and family to come together over shared interests, while traditional board games facilitate face-to-face interactions, strengthening relationships and promoting a sense of belonging. These shared gaming experiences also enhance teamwork and communication skills, which are vital in both personal and professional spheres.Furthermore, gaming can have a profound impact on cognitive abilities. Many games require strategic thinking, problem-solving, and quick decision-making - skills that are highly beneficial in career advancement and everyday life. For example, engaging in complex strategy games can sharpen critical thinking and analytical skills, enabling players to approach real-life challenges with greater ease and effectiveness.In conclusion, games should not be viewed as frivolous pursuits reserved for children. Rather, they offer a wide range of benefits to adults, including stress relief, enhanced social connections, and improved cognitive skills. It is essential for adults to recognize the value and importance of gaming as a vital component of a balanced and fulfilling life. By embracing gaming as a legitimate and worthwhile activity, adults can reap the numerous rewards that it has to offer, leading to a more relaxed, connected, and mentally agile life.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";In the modern era of global interconnectedness, technology has been instrumental in shaping a unified global culture, despite the complexities involved. The notion that technology is creating a homogeneous cultural landscape is one that I support, primarily driven by the advent of the internet, social media, and global communication networks.One of the primary ways in which technology achieves this is through the internet, which acts as a robust medium for cultural exchange. It enables individuals from varied backgrounds to exchange ideas, cultural practices, and ways of life. Social media platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram have made it possible for users worldwide to access, engage with, and share global content. A notable example is the global phenomenon of K-pop, which has successfully transitioned from a local genre to an internationally recognized form of music, thereby creating a shared musical experience that transcends geographical boundaries. This not only fosters a unified taste in music but also encourages the fusion of cultural influences, leading to the creation of hybrid artistic expressions.Furthermore, social media plays a vital role in unifying cultural narratives and values across the globe. Global movements, such as activism for climate change and social justice, gain momentum through the use of universal hashtags. This interconnectedness facilitates a unified voice that can challenge local norms and inspire collective action, demonstrating the power of modern technology in reshaping cultural paradigms.However, it's essential to acknowledge that while technology contributes to the development of a global culture, it does not eradicate local cultures. Instead, it often initiates a dialogue between global and local cultures, prompting individuals to redefine their identities in innovative ways. While traditional customs and practices are preserved, they are increasingly influenced by global cultural trends, leading to a dynamic interchange between the global and the local.In conclusion, technology is undoubtedly a driving force behind the emergence of a single, unified world culture, facilitated by cross-cultural interactions and shared global experiences. Although this trend poses challenges to the diversity of cultures, it also presents opportunities for deeper dialogue and mutual understanding among diverse cultures, ultimately enriching our global cultural tapestry.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;The notion that achieving success is significantly easier with the support of one's family holds considerable truth in today's world. The role of familial support in individual achievements has always been vital, but its nature and extent have undergone a profound transformation over time, making it more accessible and effective.One major factor is the revolution in modern communication technologies, which has fundamentally altered the way families interact. Unlike the past, where geographical distances often kept family members apart and limited their ability to provide guidance and support, today's instant messaging, video calls, and social media platforms enable family members to offer encouragement and advice from anywhere. This ease of access allows individuals to draw on their family's experiences and wisdom at crucial moments in their personal and professional lives.Furthermore, the dynamics within modern families have evolved to become more collaborative and supportive. Many families now prioritize education and personal development, stressing the importance of pursuing one's passions and goals. Parents are more likely to invest time and resources in developing their children's skills, whether through tutoring, mentorship, or emotional support, thereby laying a strong foundation for future success.The definition of success itself has also broadened, now encompassing not just financial achievements but also mental wellbeing, fulfillment, and happiness. This shift in understanding means families can foster a supportive environment that encourages the pursuit of a wide range of aspirations, thereby enhancing their members' chances of achieving success.However, it's crucial to recognize that not all families have the capacity to offer such support due to societal and economic disparities that can limit a family's ability to aid its members. Despite this, for those with supportive family networks, the available resources and encouragement provide a significant advantage in pursuing success, arguably making it easier than in previous generations.In conclusion, the modern family plays a central role in fostering success by advocating for and supporting individuals in more holistic and accessible ways than ever before, thereby underscoring the significant merit in the assertion that family support is key to achieving success in today's world.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";"The age-old debate between reading fiction and watching movies has been a longstanding topic of discussion among audiences, and I strongly believe that reading fiction surpasses the enjoyment of watching films. Although both mediums offer unique storytelling experiences, literature provides a more immersive experience than cinema.I prefer reading fiction for several reasons, primarily due to the depth and richness it offers. Novels allow readers to delve into the intricate thoughts, emotions, and motivations of characters, fostering a deeper connection with them. This is often lacking in movie adaptations, which prioritize visual storytelling over psychological depth. For instance, in Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", readers can intimately follow Elizabeth Bennet's evolving feelings towards Mr. Darcy, an experience that is often oversimplified in screen adaptations.Furthermore, reading stimulates the imagination in ways that watching movies cannot. When reading a fictional narrative, readers must use their imagination to visualize settings, create characters' appearances, and interpret the story in their own way. This process encourages cognitive engagement, personal reflection, and creativity. In contrast, movies provide a passive experience, where the visuals are predetermined by the director's vision, limiting the viewer's imaginative participation.Another advantage of reading is the ability to control the pacing of the story. Readers can choose to slow down or speed up their reading, allowing them to fully absorb and appreciate the narrative. Movies, on the other hand, are paced by the director, which can result in rushed or dragged-out scenes.In conclusion, while both literature and cinema have their own merits, reading fiction offers a more enriching and enjoyable experience due to its depth, imaginative engagement, and personalized pacing. Embracing the world of novels and short stories not only cultivates a love for storytelling but also enhances our ability to empathize and think critically, making it a more rewarding pursuit overall."
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";The issue of language extinction has sparked intense debate in recent years, with opinions strongly polarized on whether the decline of languages is beneficial or harmful to the global community. On one hand, proponents of language extinction claim that a reduction in the number of languages can improve communication and understanding among individuals. In a world where global connections are increasingly prevalent, a shared language can facilitate diplomacy, business, and cooperation across various sectors. The reasoning behind this argument is that when people share a common language, misunderstandings and miscommunications can be minimized, thereby promoting global unity and cohesion.On the other hand, critics of this viewpoint emphasize the significant cultural and intellectual losses that occur when languages disappear. Each language embodies a distinct perspective, history, tradition, and identity, contributing to the rich diversity of human experience. The loss of a language puts an entire corpus of knowledge and cultural heritage at risk of being lost forever. Indigenous languages, in particular, contain valuable insights into ecosystems, medicine, and social practices that are often not documented elsewhere. Consequently, linguistic diversity enriches humanity's collective experience, offering diverse ways of perceiving and interacting with the world.In my opinion, while the convenience of communication in a single language is appealing, the loss of linguistic diversity poses a greater threat to cultural richness and human experience. Language extinction represents not just a reduction in communication methods, but the erasure of irreplaceable cultural identities and histories. Instead of accepting language extinction, efforts should be made to promote multilingualism and preserve endangered languages. Supporting linguistic diversity can lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation of different cultures, ultimately fostering genuine harmony that goes beyond mere communication. In conclusion, preserving languages is essential for maintaining cultural heritage and promoting a truly inclusive global society.
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;The notion that life was simpler and better in the past, particularly among the elderly, is a common sentiment in many cultures. Although there are valid arguments supporting the idea that life was indeed less complicated in the past, I think this view can be overly idealized and neglects the substantial progress and challenges that have taken place.One major reason why older individuals may view their past as superior is the more leisurely pace of life back then. In earlier decades, face-to-face interactions, letters, and landline phones facilitated stronger social bonds and a greater sense of community. Many retirees fondly recall the warmth of neighborhood gatherings and the less frantic lifestyle. This appreciation for time spent with loved ones contrasts sharply with the frenetic digital era, which overwhelms us with data and distractions.However, this portrayal of the past often glosses over the numerous difficulties that characterized those times. For instance, the limited medical advancements led to higher mortality rates and restricted access to healthcare. Diseases like polio or tuberculosis, which are now easily preventable or treatable, could ravage communities. Furthermore, societal norms and expectations resulted in significant inequalities, especially for marginalized groups, which many elderly individuals experienced firsthand.While nostalgia can evoke fond memories of simpler times, it's essential to acknowledge the advancements we've made. Modern amenities such as sophisticated healthcare, access to information, global connectivity, and improved living standards have significantly enhanced the quality of life for many people. Rather than viewing the past as unequivocally superior, it's more beneficial to appreciate both the benefits of modern life and the lessons learned from the past. This approach promotes a balanced perception, recognizing the complexities of both eras while embracing the progress of human society.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;In the current complex and fast-paced financial environment, the discussion about whether secondary and higher education students should be taught money management is highly relevant and significant. I strongly believe that providing students with practical financial skills is crucial for their future success and well-being.The importance of financial literacy cannot be overstated. It is a vital life skill that enables individuals to make informed financial decisions. As students transition into adulthood, they face numerous financial responsibilities, including budgeting, saving, and investing. Without a solid foundation in financial knowledge, they may struggle to avoid debt, manage expenses, or make wise investment choices. By incorporating money management into school curricula, the risk of financial mistakes that could have long-term consequences, such as debt or poor credit ratings, can be significantly reduced.Furthermore, teaching financial education in schools prepares students for the financial challenges they will encounter in the real world. In an era where student loans and credit card debt are common, understanding concepts such as interest rates, inflation, and the importance of saving is essential. Financial literacy programs can help clarify these topics, allowing students to navigate their financial futures with confidence. Additionally, the earlier individuals develop good financial habits, the more likely they are to maintain them into adulthood.Moreover, teaching money management can also promote social equality. Students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds often have varying levels of access to financial knowledge. By providing a standard curriculum on money management, schools can help create a level playing field, ensuring that every individual has the tools to achieve financial stability and success, regardless of their background.In conclusion, integrating money management education into secondary and higher education is essential. Not only does it equip students with vital life skills, prepare them for the realities of adult financial responsibilities, and promote social equality, but it also fosters a generation that is financially literate and capable of making sound economic decisions. By doing so, we can empower students to make informed financial choices, achieve financial stability, and contribute to a more economically responsible society.
153;Some single people like to live with a roommate, while others prefer to live alone. Which would you prefer? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.Apart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.Finally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.In conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.;For many single individuals, the decision to live alone or with a roommate is a crucial one, with each option offering its unique benefits and drawbacks. On a personal note, I favor living alone, driven by my desire for autonomy, personal space, and the freedom to craft my ideal living space.The primary advantage of living alone is the independence it affords. This independence allows me to make decisions about my daily schedule, social engagements, and household habits without needing to consider someone else's opinions or preferences. For example, I can host friends at late hours or pursue my hobbies without worrying about disturbing a roommate. This autonomy enables me to lead a lifestyle that truly reflects my priorities and tastes.Another significant benefit for me is having my own personal space. Living alone gives me complete authority over my living environment, from arranging furniture to selecting decorations. I can create a space that truly represents my personality and values, which is incredibly fulfilling. For instance, I can maintain a quiet and peaceful atmosphere that is perfect for studying or relaxation, free from the distractions that might come from a roommate's activities.Living alone also promotes self-sufficiency and personal development. It compels me to handle my finances, do chores, and resolve issues on my own, which nurtures a sense of responsibility and enhances my maturity. Although living with a roommate can offer opportunities for social interaction, the solitude of living alone provides valuable time for self-reflection and personal growth.In summary, while sharing a living space with a roommate can offer companionship and lower living expenses, my preference for living alone stems from the independence, control over my living space, and opportunities for personal growth it offers. This choice enables me to fully express my individuality and lead a lifestyle that truly resonates with me.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;The discussion about smoking in public areas, especially in restaurants, has gained significant attention in recent years. I strongly believe that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants and support the implementation of state laws that ban the practice. My position is based on concerns about public health, environmental quality, and individual rights.The primary reason for this stance is the substantial health risks associated with smoking, which affect not only smokers but also those exposed to secondhand smoke. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that secondhand smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic and can cause serious health problems, including respiratory diseases and cancer. In restaurants, where people gather to eat and socialize, smoking can create an unhealthy atmosphere that jeopardizes public well-being. Therefore, laws prohibiting smoking in these establishments are crucial for safeguarding the health of patrons and employees.Furthermore, enforcing these laws enhances the overall dining experience. Many people prefer to eat in a smoke-free environment, and restaurants that enforce non-smoking policies often attract more customers by catering to the growing demographic that values health and comfort. This results in a mutually beneficial situation, where restaurants can increase revenue while prioritizing their guests' health.Additionally, supporting laws that prohibit smoking in restaurants aligns with the broader social trend towards healthier lifestyles. As people become more aware of the health implications of smoking, it is essential for legislation to reflect these values. Upholding state laws that ban smoking in restaurants is a necessary step towards fostering a culture of health awareness and responsibility.In summary, I firmly believe that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants, backed by state laws that safeguard the health and well-being of the community. Prioritizing public health is essential to ensure that dining areas are safe and enjoyable for everyone.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;The issue of whether the rising level of violence in films is having a negative impact on young people is a highly relevant and pressing concern that requires thoughtful consideration. In my opinion, the increasing depiction of violence in movies is indeed having a harmful effect on younger viewers, leading to desensitization, aggressive behavior, and a distorted view of reality.The repeated exposure of young people to violent images can lead to a loss of emotional response, making them less reactive to the seriousness of violence and more likely to view it as an acceptable way to resolve conflicts. Research has demonstrated that this desensitization can result in a reduced capacity for empathy and compassion towards victims of real-life violence. For instance, when children and adolescents are constantly exposed to disturbing scenes, they may become numb to the gravity of violence.Furthermore, the portrayal of violence in films is often glamorized, depicting it as exciting and appealing. This can create a false impression among young audiences that aggression and hostility are effective ways to manage personal conflicts or assert power. Studies have shown a link between watching violent films and an increase in aggressive behavior among children. Instead of learning constructive methods of conflict resolution, young people may imitate the violent behaviors they see on screen, resulting in a higher incidence of bullying and other forms of aggression.Additionally, the explicit depiction of violence can distort young people's understanding of societal norms and values. Films often show violence without the consequences that would normally follow in real life, fostering a false belief that such actions can be taken without repercussions. This distorted view can shape their perspective on justice, morality, and ethics, potentially leading to antisocial behavior as they interact with others.In conclusion, it is clear that the growing level of violence in films is having a negative impact on young people. The risks of desensitization, the normalization of aggressive behavior, and the distorted perception of reality necessitate a critical examination of the content presented to young audiences. As responsible stewards of media consumption, it is essential to promote responsible viewing habits that prioritize the emotional and psychological well-being of our youth.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";In today's digital age, where information is abundant and easily accessible, it is more important than ever to consult multiple news sources to stay informed. I strongly support this idea, as relying on a single source of information can lead to a distorted view of current events and issues.First and foremost, different news outlets have distinct editorial perspectives, biases, and reporting styles, which can result in vastly different portrayals of the same story. For instance, a news article in a conservative publication may present facts in a way that supports its ideological stance, while a liberal outlet may report on the same story from a completely different angle. By reading a wide range of news sources, including those with different political leanings and formats such as print, online, and broadcast media, readers can gain a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the topics at hand. This broader perspective is essential for forming balanced opinions and making informed decisions.Moreover, the concept of selective exposure, where people seek out information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs, can lead to the spread of misinformation and polarization. When individuals only follow a single news source, they are likely to miss out on important viewpoints and essential facts. Engaging with diverse perspectives not only helps to counteract confirmation bias but also encourages critical thinking, enabling individuals to evaluate the credibility of the information presented to them.Additionally, in an era where misinformation and fake news can spread rapidly through social media, consulting multiple news sources serves as a safeguard against deception. To be well-informed, one must be able to distinguish between credible reporting and misleading information, and the best way to achieve this is by conducting comprehensive research across various outlets.In conclusion, consulting multiple news sources is vital for anyone seeking to stay well-informed. It promotes a deeper understanding of complex issues, combats bias, and enhances critical analytical skills, ultimately contributing to a more informed and enlightened society.
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;The discussion around preserving old buildings versus pursuing new development in urban areas is multifaceted, echoing the broader values of society concerning history, culture, and economic expansion. Proponents of redevelopment argue that urban land is a scarce and valuable asset, and with the rising demand for housing and commercial spaces, especially in densely populated cities, removing old structures seems like a sensible solution. They claim that replacing or repurposing old buildings with modern developments optimizes land usage and boosts economic activity by providing space for contemporary businesses and residences that cater to current market demands.However, advocates for preserving old buildings stress the significance of cultural legacy and historical backdrop. Old buildings often narrate the history of a city, embodying architectural styles and craftsmanship that reflect the community's history, values, and identity. Preserving these structures can nurture a sense of community and continuity, enriching the urban landscape and boosting tourism. They also serve as landmarks, connecting future generations to their past. Moreover, many old buildings have one-of-a-kind design elements and materials that cannot be replicated in modern construction, thus enhancing the aesthetic and cultural worth of urban spaces.In my view, while the pressures of urban growth and space needs are undeniable, finding a balance is crucial. Rather than seeing old buildings as mere obstacles to development, cities should adopt adaptive reuse strategies, where these structures are repurposed for modern uses while maintaining their historical importance. This method not only preserves cultural heritage but also supports sustainable development, creating urban settings that honor the past and accommodate the future.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;The widespread use of mobile phones among young people has become a hallmark of modern life. Although some people think that this reliance on mobile phones is harmful, I believe that it has both beneficial and detrimental effects, reflecting the complexities of contemporary communication and lifestyles.On the one hand, mobile phones provide unparalleled access to information and enable effortless communication. For example, young individuals can stay up-to-date with global events through news applications and social media, allowing them to participate in discussions and feel more connected to the world. Furthermore, mobile phones offer a wealth of educational resources at users' fingertips, facilitating more effective learning outside the classroom. My own experiences illustrate this advantage, as I frequently use my mobile phone to access online lectures and collaborate with classmates via messaging applications, thereby enhancing my academic experience.On the other hand, the pervasive use of mobile phones can have numerous negative consequences. Excessive screen time can hinder the development of essential social skills, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. I have observed, for instance, that friends who overuse their mobile phones during social gatherings tend to contribute less to conversations, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere. Moreover, the constant stream of social media notifications can lead to anxiety, distraction, and decreased mental well-being, ultimately affecting academic performance.In conclusion, the popularity of mobile phones among young people has brought significant benefits, such as improved access to information and enhanced communication. However, it also poses challenges that must be addressed. By adopting a balanced approach to mobile phone usage, young individuals can minimize the negative effects while maximizing the benefits, ultimately thriving in both their personal and academic lives.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";The discussion around whether to implement fixed punishments for each crime type or to consider individual circumstances during sentencing is intricate and has multiple facets. Those in favor of fixed punishments believe that a standardized system ensures fairness, equality, and consistency within the justice system. They argue that consistent penalties effectively deter crime by clearly communicating the consequences of specific actions. With predetermined penalties, individuals are less likely to believe they can avoid justice, and the system appears more efficient and less prone to bias.On the other hand, the opposing viewpoint advocates for a more nuanced approach, taking into account the unique circumstances surrounding each crime. Crimes can vary significantly in context and motivation - for example, a theft driven by financial desperation versus one committed out of greed. By examining the individual context, judges can make more informed decisions that prioritize justice, rehabilitation, and understanding over mere punishment. This approach promotes a more compassionate justice system, where individuals can learn from their mistakes rather than receiving blanket penalties that fail to address the underlying causes of their behavior.Moreover, inflexible sentencing can result in punishments that are disproportionate and overlook a person's background, mental health, or coercive circumstances. For instance, a young person from a troubled background may react differently to a situation compared to an adult acting with full intention. Therefore, allowing flexibility in sentencing enables more tailored and constructive outcomes.In summary, although fixed punishments provide clarity and uniformity, considering individual circumstances during sentencing can lead to a more just and effective justice system. By balancing the need for consistent legal standards with the recognition of personal circumstances, it's possible to create a system that upholds both justice and compassion.
160;Some people prefer to spend their free time outdoors. Other people prefer to spend their leisure time indoors. Would you prefer to be outside or would you prefer to be inside for your leisure activities? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your choice.;People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. Moreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.Admittedly, indoor activities are fun. There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity. Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time.;When it comes to how I like to spend my free time, I have to say that being outdoors is my top choice. There are many reasons for this, including how good it is for my body and mind, and how it lets me connect with nature. One of the main reasons I love being outside is that it gives me a chance to be around nature, which always leaves me feeling refreshed and full of energy. Whether I'm hiking, biking, or just walking on the beach, I find that being in nature is amazing for my mood and energy. The beautiful views, the sounds of the wind, and the fresh air all come together to make me feel happy and calm. For example, I went on a hike recently and the views were so beautiful that they lifted my mood and made me feel connected to the world around me.Another great thing about being outside is that it's good for my physical health. Doing sports like soccer, running, or swimming encourages me to be more active. I really enjoy jogging early in the morning when it's quiet, which helps me get ready for the day and clears my mind. Exercising outside gives me a natural high and helps me feel more clear-headed and less stressed.Lastly, spending time outside is a great way to spend time with friends and family. Doing things like team sports or having a barbecue outside gives us a chance to bond and have fun together. This kind of togetherness is hard to find when we're inside, where things can feel more lonely, like when we're watching TV or reading.In the end, I love spending my free time outside because it lets me be around nature, get exercise, and spend time with people I care about. Being outside is a great way to relax and feel fulfilled, and it's a big part of how I like to spend my free time.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The discussion about affordable air travel is often characterized by two distinct viewpoints. On one hand, proponents of budget-friendly air travel highlight its ability to make mobility more inclusive, providing ordinary individuals with the chance to visit far-off destinations. Low-cost airlines have transformed the travel landscape by making flying more accessible to people who may have previously considered it a luxury. This increased accessibility promotes cultural exchange, stimulates local economies through tourism, and enriches personal experiences by allowing people to explore diverse environments.On the other hand, critics contend that while cheap air travel expands our horizons, it also worsens environmental problems. The aviation sector is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, and the surge in flights resulting from lower fares can lead to increased pollution and depletion of natural resources. As air travel becomes more frequent, its environmental consequences intensify, posing a threat not only to the climate but also to biodiversity. As a result, some argue that increasing ticket prices could discourage unnecessary travel and promote more sustainable behaviors, such as opting for trains or choosing local destinations that require less carbon-intensive transportation methods.In my view, a balanced approach is necessary. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as high-speed trains, alongside affordable air travel, we can mitigate some of the environmental impacts. Implementing carbon offset initiatives and promoting sustainable aviation technologies may also help reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without limiting accessibility. Raising awareness about the environmental effects of air travel can foster a more mindful travel culture, where people make more informed choices.To sum up, while affordable air travel promotes personal freedom and economic growth, it is crucial that we address its negative environmental consequences. Finding a balance that allows for exploration without compromising the planet's well-being is essential for the sake of future generations.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;The decision to live in a small town versus a big city is often a matter of personal preference and values. Although both have their advantages, I am drawn to the quaintness and peacefulness of a small town.A significant benefit of residing in a small town is the strong sense of community and security that comes with it. In these close-knit communities, relationships are often more intimate and meaningful. Neighbors tend to be familiar with one another, frequently engaging in conversations and lending a helping hand when needed. For example, in my hometown, events like farmers' markets and festivals promote a strong sense of belonging among residents, who gather to celebrate their heritage and culture. This communal atmosphere fosters deeper connections and a sense of safety and support that can be elusive in the fast-paced environment of a big city.Furthermore, small towns usually offer a more leisurely pace of life, allowing for a more relaxed and rewarding lifestyle. The streets are less crowded, and the daily rush is replaced by an abundance of green spaces and nature. Growing up, I enjoyed spending time outdoors in nearby parks, where I could hike, cycle, or simply bask in the serenity that nature provided. This access to natural beauty is often lacking in urban settings, where it is overshadowed by concrete and constant traffic.Additionally, the cost of living in small towns is generally significantly lower than in big cities. Housing is often more affordable, enabling individuals and families to enjoy a better quality of life. With less financial pressure, residents can pursue a more balanced lifestyle, dedicating time to hobbies and personal interests rather than worrying about inflated housing costs and expenses.In conclusion, while big cities offer certain amenities and opportunities, I find the peacefulness, community spirit, and affordability of small towns to be far more appealing. The idyllic life they offer serves as a retreat from the demands and chaos of urban environments, making it an ideal choice for me.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;"Beyond traditional salary increases and promotions, there are numerous alternative rewards that can motivate employees to maintain excellent performance. These incentives can lead to increased job satisfaction, loyalty, and a more productive work environment. A powerful non-monetary incentive is recognition, which can significantly enhance employee morale and motivation. For example, companies can establish an ""Employee of the Month"" program or hold regular meetings to acknowledge individual achievements. This approach not only validates the hard work of recognized employees but also motivates others to strive for similar recognition.Flexible work arrangements are another effective incentive. By offering employees the option to work from home or adjust their schedules, companies can help them achieve a better balance between work and personal life. Tech companies like Google often provide flexible working conditions, demonstrating trust in their employees' ability to manage their time effectively. This autonomy can result in increased productivity and a culture of responsibility.Investing in employees' professional growth is also a potent reward. Companies that provide opportunities for development demonstrate a commitment to their employees' career advancement. Access to training programs, workshops, and courses can make employees feel valued, encouraging loyalty. For instance, Deloitte's robust mentorship programs enhance employee skills and build a supportive work community.Additionally, team-building activities and wellness initiatives can foster a sense of camaraderie and engagement among employees. Organizing retreats, workshops, and wellness days can promote team unity and demonstrate a company's investment in employee well-being. Companies like Zappos, which prioritize community and culture, often achieve high levels of employee satisfaction.In conclusion, recognition, flexibility, professional development, and wellness initiatives are effective tools for motivating and rewarding employees, beyond traditional financial incentives. By creating an environment that values employee contributions and well-being, organizations can cultivate a motivated and committed workforce."
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;The question of whether university students should be required to attend classes or have the option to skip them is a contentious issue in the world of education. In my opinion, mandatory class attendance is the way to go, and I have several strong arguments to support this stance.The most significant advantage of compulsory attendance is the face-to-face interaction it facilitates between students and professors. This interaction is crucial in creating a stimulating learning environment where students can engage in real-time discussions, ask questions, and participate in debates that help them grasp the subject matter more deeply. Engaging in these conversations not only improves knowledge retention but also enables students to develop vital skills like critical thinking and communication, which are highly valued in the job market. Students who miss classes may miss out on these valuable learning opportunities, which can negatively impact their academic performance.In addition to this, making attendance mandatory promotes a sense of responsibility among students. For many, university is a stepping stone to independence, but this transition can be tough. By requiring students to attend classes, they develop discipline, a sense of responsibility for their own learning, and essential time management skills. This structured approach helps students establish a routine that is vital for achieving success in their academic and professional lives. On the other hand, optional attendance may encourage students to procrastinate and show a lack of commitment to their studies.It's also worth noting the social benefits of attending classes. Universities are not just institutions for academic learning, but also for personal growth and networking. Interacting with peers in a classroom setting can lead to joint projects, study groups, and lasting friendships. These social interactions are a key part of the university experience and can greatly enhance a student's personal and professional development.To sum up, while some people may advocate for the flexibility of optional attendance, the advantages of requiring university students to attend classes – including improved learning, accountability, and social interaction – are too significant to ignore. A structured approach to attendance fosters a dynamic and supportive learning environment, ultimately preparing students for their future pursuits.
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;The age-old debate between residing in a small town and a big city is a multifaceted one, encompassing various lifestyle aspects, personal inclinations, and societal norms. Although both options have their merits, my personal preference leans towards living in a small town.What I find particularly appealing about small-town living is the strong sense of community that tends to thrive in these environments. In smaller communities, residents often know and interact with their neighbors, fostering deeper, more meaningful relationships. This, in turn, creates a supportive atmosphere where individuals look out for one another. Local events, such as festivals and markets, provide ample opportunities for people to connect and form lasting bonds, which can be challenging to establish in the anonymous urban jungle. The close-knit ambiance of small towns cultivates a sense of belonging, often lacking in big cities.Moreover, small towns typically offer a more serene and peaceful way of life. The constant din and chaos of metropolitan areas can be overwhelming, with incessant noise and traffic contributing to heightened stress levels. In contrast, small towns are often nestled in picturesque natural surroundings, providing ample opportunities for outdoor pursuits like hiking, biking, and simply appreciating nature. This connection with the outdoors can substantially enhance one's quality of life, promoting improved mental and physical well-being.Another significant advantage of small towns is the generally lower cost of living. For instance, housing costs are often more affordable than in urban areas, allowing for a better balance between work and personal life. With lower expenses, individuals can allocate more time to enjoying life's simple pleasures, rather than dedicating excessive hours to work.In conclusion, although big cities boast excitement and diverse opportunities, the benefits of small-town living, including community ties, tranquility, and affordability, present a more appealing and fulfilling lifestyle, in my opinion. The decision of where to reside significantly influences our overall happiness, and I firmly believe that living in a small town would provide a rich and satisfying experience.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;"The emergence of computers has had a profound impact on every facet of human existence, sparking a range of opinions about their effects on our daily lives. Although some people believe that computers have greatly simplified life, I argue that they have also brought about new layers of complexity and stress that did not previously exist.On the one hand, computers have undoubtedly increased convenience in numerous ways. Tasks that formerly required hours can now be accomplished in a matter of minutes. For example, online banking has transformed the way we manage our finances, eliminating the need to physically visit a bank to deposit checks or transfer funds. Moreover, the internet has enabled instant access to information, allowing students to conduct research quickly and efficiently, thereby enhancing the learning process. The internet has also revolutionized communication, enabling us to connect with people worldwide with just a few clicks, fostering relationships and collaborations that were previously limited by geographical constraints.On the other hand, the convenience offered by computers can often mask the growing intricacies of our daily lives. The vast array of applications and software can be overwhelming to navigate, and the constant technological updates and changes can cause stress as users struggle to keep pace. Furthermore, the proliferation of social media and online interactions has created a paradox: while we are more ""connected"" than ever, the pressure to maintain an online presence can lead to feelings of anxiety and inadequacy. The constant stream of notifications and demands for our attention can also distract us from meaningful offline experiences.In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly made many aspects of life more convenient and easier, they have also introduced complexities and stresses that can be overwhelming. It is essential to strike a balance between the benefits and challenges of technology in order to understand our relationship with it. Ultimately, it is crucial for individuals to navigate this ever-evolving digital landscape thoughtfully, ensuring that technology serves as a means to enhance life rather than complicate it."
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;The emergence of technology, particularly computers and modems, has revolutionized the traditional workplace, allowing office workers to fulfill their duties from the comfort of their own homes. The discussion surrounding the promotion of remote work is complex, with strong arguments in favor of this practice.One of the most significant benefits of working remotely is the improvement of work-life balance. Employees can organize their days to accommodate personal obligations, such as taking care of children or engaging in health-promoting activities, resulting in increased job satisfaction. This flexibility often leads to higher productivity levels, as workers can perform in environments that suit their individual preferences. Furthermore, the elimination of daily commutes not only saves time but also reduces stress, enabling employees to focus their energy more efficiently on their tasks.Moreover, companies can substantially reduce operational costs associated with maintaining physical office spaces. These savings can be redirected towards employee benefits, technological upgrades, or training programs, thereby enhancing a company's competitive edge in the market and fostering a culture of innovation and adaptability.However, there are also convincing arguments against widespread remote work. Critics contend that the lack of face-to-face interaction can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection among team members, potentially hindering collaboration and the development of a unified workplace culture. Additionally, not all employees may have ideal home environments that promote productivity, which could lead to distractions that impact performance.In conclusion, despite valid concerns regarding remote work, I firmly believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Encouraging employees to adopt this flexible approach can result in increased satisfaction, productivity, and cost efficiency. By addressing the challenges through effective communication and providing necessary resources, businesses can establish a thriving work environment that aligns with the evolving needs of the modern workforce.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;The debate about the role of university professors has been ongoing, with a particular focus on the balance between research and teaching. In my opinion, a professor's primary responsibility should be to educate students, as this is the core purpose of universities and has a significant impact on society.The primary goal of universities is to promote learning and knowledge growth among students. Professors play a vital role in shaping the minds of future leaders, professionals, and thinkers, and are not just mere transmitters of knowledge. Effective teaching helps develop critical thinking, creativity, and intellectual curiosity, all of which are essential in today's fast-paced world. By prioritizing their teaching role, professors can ensure that students deeply engage with their subjects and acquire the necessary skills for their future careers.It's also worth noting that a professor's research can enhance the learning process. When professors are involved in cutting-edge research, they bring new insights and real-world experiences to the classroom. However, if research takes precedence over teaching, students may miss out on personalized guidance and mentorship, leading to a less interactive classroom environment and reduced critical dialogue between students and educators.The impact of education extends far beyond the classroom, as educated individuals contribute significantly to societal progress, driving innovation, social change, and informed citizenship. The knowledge and skills imparted in universities can have far-reaching consequences, making the role of professors as educators crucial.In conclusion, while research is undoubtedly important for advancing knowledge and institutional prestige, the core of a professor's role lies in educating students. Striking a balance between research and teaching is essential, but prioritizing education ensures that students are equipped to navigate and contribute to the world effectively. This approach ultimately aligns with the fundamental purpose of universities and has a profound impact on society.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;The past century has seen unprecedented technological advancements, which have profoundly impacted nearly every facet of human existence. These developments have made significant contributions to societal, economic, and environmental realms. Nevertheless, the swift pace of technological progress has also given rise to several detrimental effects that cannot be disregarded. In my opinion, while the advantages of technology are considerable, its unfavorable consequences necessitate thorough examination.On the positive side, technology has greatly enhanced communication, healthcare, and education. The advent of the internet, for instance, has revolutionized the manner in which individuals interact and access information, effectively bridging geographical divides. Advances in medical technology, including telemedicine and the utilization of artificial intelligence in diagnosis, have yielded improved health outcomes and an increase in life expectancy. Furthermore, technology has facilitated access to education via online learning platforms, thereby empowering individuals in underserved regions to acquire knowledge and skills.However, the negative repercussions of technological advancements are substantial. A primary concern is the erosion of privacy, as digital surveillance becomes increasingly pervasive. The proliferation of social media and data collection has led to the exploitation of personal information, resulting in a loss of autonomy and heightened vulnerability to cybercrime. Moreover, the rise of automation poses a threat to job security for millions, as machines supplant human labor in various sectors. This, in turn, has raised pressing economic concerns regarding unemployment and income disparity.Moreover, the environmental implications of technology cannot be overlooked. The manufacture and disposal of electronic devices contribute to pollution and the depletion of resources. The increasing reliance on fossil fuels to power these technologies exacerbates the climate crisis.In conclusion, while technological progress has undoubtedly enhanced the quality of life and fostered global development, its negative consequences present pressing challenges that warrant attention. Striking a balance between embracing innovation and mitigating its repercussions is essential for ensuring a sustainable and equitable future. 
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The old adage ""prevention is better than cure"" is a widely accepted principle in the fields of public health and wellness. Many healthcare experts and policymakers agree that spending more on health education and preventative care, rather than treatment, is a good idea. I also think this is true, as focusing on prevention can have many long-term benefits for both individuals and the healthcare system.The main advantage of investing in prevention is that it can greatly reduce the number of cases of long-term illnesses like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. These conditions can often be prevented by teaching people about healthy lifestyles, good nutrition, and regular exercise. By giving people the knowledge and tools they need to make healthier choices, we can reduce the strain these illnesses put on healthcare systems and improve overall quality of life.Another benefit of preventative care is that it can lower healthcare costs in the long run. Treating advanced illnesses is often much more expensive than preventing them. For example, the cost of dealing with complications from long-term illnesses, like hospital stays and long-term therapies, can be very high. On the other hand, community health programs, screenings, and vaccination campaigns can save a lot of money and make sure healthcare resources are used effectively.However, it's crucial to remember that while prevention is very important, it shouldn't overshadow the need for good treatment options. We need a balanced approach that funds both prevention and treatment properly. For instance, people who already have health issues need ongoing care to manage their conditions effectively.In summary, I firmly believe that spending a big part of a country's health budget on health education and preventative measures is key to improving public health. This approach not only helps individuals stay healthy, but also creates a sustainable healthcare system, leading to healthier communities and less financial strain on national resources."
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;When considering accommodation options during university, students are often faced with the dilemma of choosing between living in university dormitories and renting an apartment in the surrounding area. Both options have unique benefits that cater to different tastes and lifestyles.Residing in university dormitories offers a smooth introduction to university life, with one of the main advantages being the easy access to campus facilities such as libraries,,assistant, and recreational centers. This close proximity to campus makes it easier to attend classes and participate in university activities. Furthermore, dormitories often promote a sense of community among residents, which can be beneficial for students looking to form new friendships and participate in social events. The close living quarters encourage interaction among students, helping to alleviate the feelings of loneliness that some students may experience during their first year.In contrast, opting to live in a community apartment presents a distinct set of advantages. An apartment typically provides more independence and autonomy, allowing students to establish their own routines and living environments. Students living off-campus may also have access to larger living spaces and the ability to prepare their own meals, leading to healthier eating habits. Additionally, living in a residential neighborhood can provide a more diverse social experience, exposing students to the local culture and community life beyond the university environment.From a personal perspective, I would prefer to live in a community apartment. Although I appreciate the convenience and social opportunities provided by university housing, I value the independence and personal space that comes with living off-campus. Having the freedom to create my own schedule, cook my own meals, and engage with the broader community would significantly contribute to my personal growth during my university years. Moreover, acquiring essential life skills such as budgeting and managing household responsibilities would be invaluable experiences that are crucial for my transition into adulthood.
172;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.When people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. Finally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.;The role and value of zoos in contemporary society has been a subject of debate for a long time, with opinions sharply divided on their utility. However, I firmly believe that zoos possess considerable significance, both in terms of educational value and the conservation of species.Primarily, modern zoos are indispensable in educating the public about the natural world and environmental issues. They offer visitors the chance to observe animals in a controlled yet realistic setting, which might not be achievable in the wild. For instance, through interactive programs and guided tours, children can gain insights into biodiversity, ecosystems, and the necessity of conservation efforts. By promoting awareness and appreciation of wildlife, zoos motivate upcoming generations to take part in environmental protection and endorse conservation endeavors.Additionally, zoos are pivotal in the preservation of species that are at risk of extinction. Many zoos are involved in breeding programs designed to boost the numbers of endangered species. The effectiveness of these initiatives is evident in the recovery of species such as the California condor and the Arabian oryx, which, following extensive efforts in captivity, have been successfully reintroduced into their natural habitats. Without the intervention of zoos, these species would likely be driven towards extinction due to habitat destruction and poaching.Critics of zoos often claim that keeping animals in enclosures is cruel. Nonetheless, many contemporary zoos give priority to animal welfare, creating environments that simulate the animals' natural habitats, thereby allowing them to exhibit behaviors that are natural to them. Forward-thinking zoos are dedicated to conducting research that enhances their animal care practices and produces valuable data for global wildlife conservation.In summary, zoos are certainly not without purpose. They function as crucial institutions for both education and the conservation of species. By fostering an appreciation for the natural world and playing a pivotal role in safeguarding endangered species, zoos make a positive contribution to society and the planet at large.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"In the world of cinema, various genres cater to different tastes, captivating audiences in diverse ways. On a personal level, I'm drawn to thought-provoking films that inspire contemplation and self-reflection. Although entertaining films undoubtedly have their value, I find that serious movies, with their depth and complexity, resonate with me on a deeper level.My affinity for serious films stems from their ability to stimulate critical thinking and encourage viewers to engage with complex issues. Movies that tackle difficult themes, such as social injustices, moral ambiguities, or existential queries, often leave a lasting impression on the audience. For example, films like ""Schindler's List"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" not only chronicle historical atrocities but also offer insights into human compassion, nature, and the consequences of inaction. By confronting audiences with challenging subjects, these films foster empathy and understanding towards others' experiences.Moreover, serious films frequently feature intricate narrative structures and character development, which invests audiences emotionally in the characters' journeys. A film like ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" portrays the struggles of a father striving to create a better life for his son, exploring themes of resilience, hope, and the pursuit of happiness. This prompts viewers to reflect on their own lives, aspirations, and values.Serious films also have the power to spark discussions and debates among audiences, promoting a deeper understanding of complex issues. Films like ""The Social Network"" can initiate conversations about ambition, ethics, and the intricacies of human relationships in the digital era. Such discussions enrich our understanding of contemporary society, allowing audiences to examine their beliefs, values, and perspectives.In conclusion, while comedic films have their appeal and provide light-hearted entertainment, my preference is for serious movies that encourage introspection, engagement with significant themes, and critical thinking. The transformative potential of these films creates a rewarding cinematic experience that lingers long after the viewing, leaving a lasting impact on the audience."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;The media's impact on shaping public opinion is undeniable in today's digital world, particularly when it comes to public figures and celebrities. I strongly believe that the media, including TV, newspapers, and magazines, gives too much attention to the personal lives of these individuals, often at the cost of more important issues that deserve public discussion.A major issue is that the constant focus on celebrity culture takes away from important news coverage. While the mundane aspects of a celebrity's life, such as their relationships or fashion sense, dominate the headlines, critical global issues like climate change, corruption, and social justice are often pushed to the side and overshadowed by sensational gossip. This unbalanced focus not only makes light of significant social issues but also promotes a culture of superficiality, where people may prioritize entertainment over education or awareness.Moreover, the media's obsession with the personal lives of public figures can lead to harmful and damaging narratives. The constant scrutiny by the media often results in an invasion of privacy, and celebrities become targets of unwarranted criticism and judgment. The mental health struggles of public figures, which are made worse by invasive media coverage, highlight the toxic environment created by this fixation. Such attention can dehumanize these individuals, reinforcing stereotypes and perpetuating a culture of judgment rather than understanding and empathy.Additionally, the overemphasis on celebrity personal lives can distort societal values, leading the public to idolize fame rather than achievement, integrity, or meaningful contributions to society. Young audiences, in particular, may equate success with notoriety rather than hard work, dedication, or positive impact.In conclusion, while media coverage of public figures can provide entertainment and distraction, I firmly believe that the excessive focus on their personal lives is detrimental to both individuals and society as a whole. It is crucial to promote a more balanced media landscape that prioritizes valuable and informative content over sensationalism, and encourages a more nuanced and thoughtful public discourse.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;For many travelers, visiting museums is an essential aspect of their journey. Museums are not just storehouses of art and history, but also play a crucial role in exploring and understanding various cultures, thereby broadening our knowledge of the world.A primary motivation for visiting museums is to delve deeper into the history and culture of a particular region. By showcasing artifacts, artworks, and exhibitions, museums offer a tangible link to the past, allowing travelers to grasp the evolution of civilizations. For instance, the British Museum in London features the Rosetta Stone and other ancient relics, providing valuable insights into Egyptian culture. Such encounters enable travelers to appreciate the distinctiveness of the culture they are exploring and cultivate a sense of global unity.Another significant reason for visiting museums is the prospect of acquiring knowledge and finding inspiration. Many museums provide interactive exhibits and guided tours tailored to diverse interests and age groups. For example, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History offers engaging science and natural history exhibits for children, while the Louvre provides an immersive experience for art enthusiasts. These experiences can ignite curiosity, promote learning, and even inspire creative thinking among visitors.Moreover, museums frequently reflect on contemporary societal concerns, prompting critical thinking and encouraging visitors to engage with the world in meaningful ways. Exhibitions focusing on pressing global issues, such as climate change or social justice, can stimulate discussions and raise awareness, urging travelers to contemplate their role in advocacy.In summary, people visit museums during their travels for a variety of reasons, including the desire to connect with local culture and history, to educate and inspire themselves, and to engage with important societal themes. Museums enhance travel experiences, foster lasting memories, and offer more than just sightseeing, leaving a profound impact on travelers.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";In the ever-changing world of education, students are faced with a crucial decision: to learn from home using technology or to attend traditional schools. Both options have their strengths, but I strongly believe that studying at home with the aid of technology provides distinct benefits that cater more effectively to the diverse needs of modern students.One of the primary advantages of learning from home is its flexibility. By allowing students to create their own schedules, they can study at times when they are most focused and productive. This flexibility enables students to strike a balance between their academic responsibilities and other activities or interests, promoting a more well-rounded educational experience. For instance, a student who is passionate about sports can dedicate more time to practice without having to sacrifice their academic commitments, leading to higher motivation and overall satisfaction.Additionally, technology-based learning offers access to a vast array of educational resources. Online platforms can provide interactive learning materials, virtual experiments, and a multitude of digital resources tailored to different learning styles. For example, students who are visual learners can benefit from video content, while those who are auditory learners can gain from recorded lectures. This wide range of resources ensures that students can find the most effective way to understand complex ideas, thereby enhancing their academic achievements.Another significant benefit of studying at home is the decrease in social pressures that are commonly found in traditional school environments. Many students encounter challenges such as bullying or social pressure, which can detract from their learning experience. Home learning creates a secure and supportive environment where students can concentrate on their studies without the distractions caused by social interactions.In conclusion, while traditional schools provide structure and social engagement, I prefer the flexibility and diversity of studying at home through technology. The capability to personalize learning, combined with access to a wide range of resources and a low-stress environment, makes home-based learning an increasingly practical and appealing choice for future generations of students.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;The proposal to build a large shopping center in my neighborhood has sparked a divided reaction among residents, but I strongly believe that it should be rejected. Although some people may think that a shopping center would bring benefits like increased convenience and job opportunities, I think the negative effects on our community, traffic, and environment are more significant.First and foremost, a shopping center would likely change the special character of our neighborhood. Our area is known for its strong sense of community and local businesses that reflect who we are. If a big retail complex were to be built, it could hurt these small businesses that rely on local customers and community involvement. Instead of celebrating what makes our neighborhood unique, a shopping center could make it look like every other commercial area, losing the special flavor that makes our community special.Another major concern is the traffic. Our streets are already busy, especially during rush hour, and adding a shopping center would make the problem worse. This would make the streets unsafe for walkers and bike riders. More traffic also means more accidents and a less pleasant place for families and residents who enjoy the peacefulness of our neighborhood.We also need to think about how this would affect the environment. Building a shopping center usually means big changes to the land and can hurt local animal habitats. Clearing land for stores can also lead to more pollution and less green space, which is important for keeping nature healthy and giving residents places to relax.In summary, while having a shopping center might seem convenient and create jobs, the downsides - including losing our community's special character, more traffic, and hurting the environment - outweigh the good points. We should prioritize keeping our neighborhood's unique charm and well-being over business interests.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";"In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, developing strong communication skills is vital for achieving success. This skill involves more than just basic conversation; it requires the ability to clearly convey ideas, actively listen, and build meaningful relationships with others. With technology and globalization bringing people closer together, effective communication has become essential in both personal and professional life.There are several reasons why effective communication is crucial. Firstly, it promotes successful collaboration. In team-based work environments, the ability to clearly express thoughts and ideas is key to driving projects forward. For example, consider a team working on a new product development project. Team members who can clearly express their ideas and engage in discussions are more likely to contribute innovative solutions, leading to better outcomes. Effective communication fosters trust, encourages open dialogue, and allows diverse perspectives to be shared, ultimately resulting in better decision-making.Secondly, effective communication is vital for navigating cultural differences in an increasingly globalized workplace. As companies expand across borders, professionals often work with colleagues from diverse cultural backgrounds. Understanding and respecting different communication styles can prevent misunderstandings and promote a harmonious work environment. For instance, a manager who practices active listening and adapts their communication style to suit team members from diverse cultures is more likely to build a cohesive team, reducing conflict and enhancing productivity.Lastly, effective communication is essential for personal branding in a social media-dominated era. Individuals who can present themselves attractively can create opportunities for networking, job prospects, and partnerships. For example, a professional with strong writing skills can showcase their expertise through LinkedIn articles, making them more visible to potential employers and opening up new career opportunities.In conclusion, mastering effective communication is a vital skill for success in today's world. It enables collaboration, bridges cultural gaps, and enhances personal branding. As the world becomes increasingly complex and interconnected, the ability to communicate effectively will undoubtedly set individuals apart and contribute to their achievements, making it an essential skill to acquire in today's fast-paced and evolving world."
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";The lives of many individuals are profoundly impacted by groups and organizations, which serve as essential foundations for social interaction, personal growth, and support. The significance of these entities can be grasped through three key aspects: the provision of social connections, the pursuit of shared objectives, and the offer of collective support.Initially, groups facilitate vital social connections, addressing the inherent human need for companionship and a sense of belonging. This can be observed in various types of groups, such as book clubs, sports teams, or professional organizations, where members develop lasting relationships and a sense of camaraderie. For example, a study group not only enhances academic understanding but also fosters lifelong friendships. Through group interactions, individuals exchange experiences, cultural backgrounds, and perspectives, thereby broadening their worldview and contributing to personal development.Furthermore, organizations bring together individuals who share common goals, providing a collective platform for action towards these shared interests. Members of a charity, for instance, collaborate to address pressing societal issues like poverty or education. By combining their resources and talents, they achieve more than any single individual could, giving their efforts a deeper sense of purpose. The structured nature of these organizations also enhances productivity, as clear roles and responsibilities facilitate focused and efficient work towards shared goals.Lastly, groups and organizations function as critical support networks. During times of crisis or significant life changes, individuals often rely on these networks for guidance and encouragement. Support groups, such as those for addiction recovery or grief, offer a safe environment where individuals can share experiences and emotions, validating their struggles and fostering resilience. The emotional and psychological benefits of these interactions can be transformative, providing hope and strength in challenging times.In summary, groups and organizations play a vital role in the lives of many, providing social connection, collaborative purpose, and emotional support. Their impact extends beyond mere membership, influencing personal identities and overall well-being. Recognizing their importance can encourage individuals to seek and engage with various groups and organizations, leading to a more enriched and fulfilling life.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;The idea of building a new university in our community has both good and bad points that need to be thought about carefully. On the positive side, having a university here could help our local economy grow. Universities create many jobs, not just for teachers and staff, but also for people who take care of the buildings and for local businesses that benefit from the students and staff who come here. More people walking around can help shops, restaurants, and housing, making our community a lively place. Also, a university can bring in money for research and work with businesses to promote new ideas and entrepreneurship.Another good thing is that it would give people who live here a chance to get a higher education without having to travel far. This could help people in our community learn new skills and be more competitive for jobs. Plus, having a university could make our community smarter and more cultured, with places for talks, workshops, and events that everyone can enjoy.However, there are also some negative points to think about. Building and running a university could make traffic and noise worse, which might disturb the quiet atmosphere we enjoy now. Our roads and public transport might get too crowded, needing upgrades that could be expensive for the city. Also, with more students coming, the cost of housing might go up, which could make it hard for long-time residents to stay or for families to afford living here.In summary, while having a university in our community could bring many benefits like economic growth and education, it also has challenges like making our infrastructure busier and housing more expensive. We need to think about all these points carefully to understand how this project might affect us in the long run.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";The discussion around funding for higher education is complex, with strong arguments on both sides. Proponents of free college education believe that accessing higher education should be a fundamental right, similar to elementary and high school education. They argue that by offering free education, the government can remove socio-economic obstacles that prevent gifted individuals from achieving their academic goals. A well-educated population can contribute to the economy more effectively, drive innovation, and enhance social mobility. Additionally, countries like Germany and Sweden, which have implemented free college education, often have higher enrollment rates and lower student debt, providing a model that could be replicated elsewhere.On the other hand, those against free college education argue that individuals should be responsible for their own educational costs. They claim that government-funded education could lead to inefficiencies, as it may reduce the perceived value of a college degree. The competition for college admission might decrease, potentially flooding the job market with graduates and devaluing degrees. Moreover, the financial burden of free education would likely be borne by taxpayers, raising concerns about the long-term viability of such programs.Ultimately, both perspectives present valid points. While free college education aligns with principles of fairness and societal benefit, it also raises practical concerns about funding and the value of a degree. Finding a balance between government support and individual responsibility could lead to a more sustainable and equitable education system. Potential middle-ground solutions, such as income-based repayment plans, scholarships, and targeted government funding for underrepresented communities, could ensure access to education while maintaining personal accountability.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";The notion that television is detrimental to communication among friends and family is a common criticism in today's world. However, I do not agree that television is the root of destroyed communication. On the contrary, I believe that television, when consumed in moderation, can be a powerful catalyst for conversation and bonding among loved ones.One of the primary advantages of television is its ability to provide shared experiences that bring people together. Watching a popular show, for example, can initiate discussions about characters, plot developments, and underlying messages, fostering deeper connections among viewers. Moreover, familiarity with cultural references from popular series or movies can enrich relationships by offering common ground for conversation. Families who regularly gather to watch their favorite program often discover new topics to discuss, which in turn, strengthens their bonds.Furthermore, television can be a valuable educational tool that encourages discussions about important issues within families. Documentary and news programs bring critical topics into the living room, providing a platform for family members to express their opinions and learn from each other. This can lead to meaningful conversations about societal issues, personal beliefs, and values, ultimately fortifying family relationships.It is, however, crucial to acknowledge the potential for television to become a communication barrier if viewing habits are not moderated. When individuals become too engrossed in their screens and fail to interact with each other, the quality of their interactions can suffer. Therefore, setting boundaries around television viewing is essential to ensure that it remains a source of enrichment rather than a distraction.In conclusion, rather than viewing television as a destructive force, we should recognize its potential to enhance relationships when used thoughtfully. While excessive television viewing can indeed hinder communication, it can also provide valuable opportunities for connection and conversation when approached with mindfulness. By consuming television in a thoughtful manner, we can harness its power to foster deeper connections and more meaningful relationships among friends and family.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life.";I am convinced that attending a live event is a more thrilling experience than watching it on television. The sensation of being part of a live audience, surrounded by the energy and excitement of the moment, is unbeatable and brings an extra layer of enjoyment to any performance.One of the primary advantages of live performances is that they offer an immersive experience that cannot be replicated on a TV screen. For instance, attending a concert provides a multisensory experience, with the music resonating through your body, captivating visual effects, and the sight of the performer on stage, creating an emotional bond that is often missing when watching from home. The electric atmosphere, collective audience reactions, and spontaneity of live events generate a unique ambiance that amplifies the enjoyment. In contrast, watching on TV often feels distant and lacks the emotional investment that comes with experiencing an event in person.Furthermore, attending live events provides the chance to connect with like-minded fans and share the experience with them. The sense of camaraderie and togetherness felt when cheering for a favorite team or singing along at a concert fosters a sense of belonging and community. These shared moments often lead to treasured memories, such as singing along to a favorite song or celebrating a winning moment. In contrast, watching an event alone at home can feel isolating and less rewarding.Another significant advantage of live performances is that they often feature unexpected surprises, such as special guest appearances or unscripted moments, which add to their excitement and appeal. These unique moments make each performance memorable and one-of-a-kind. In contrast, televised events can be overly scripted and predictable, lacking the spontaneity and excitement that live experiences offer.In summary, the excitement of attending a live performance - its immersive atmosphere, communal engagement, and unpredictability - makes it a more enjoyable experience than watching the same event on TV. These elements combine to create unforgettable memories that last long after the event has ended.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";The shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is a pressing issue in today's society, with ongoing debates and a growing sense of urgency. I strongly believe that renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, will ultimately supplant fossil fuels like gas, oil, and coal. This transition is both necessary and inevitable, driven by environmental, economic, and technological considerations.A major driver of this transition is the imperative to address climate change. The combustion of fossil fuels is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming and extreme weather events. In contrast, renewable energy sources provide a clean alternative, capable of substantially reducing carbon emissions. For example, solar and wind energy generate electricity without the harmful emissions associated with fossil fuels.Furthermore, the economic feasibility of renewable energy is becoming increasingly apparent. The costs of solar panels and wind turbines have decreased dramatically over the past decade, a trend likely to persist as innovation continues and economies of scale are achieved. Transitioning to renewable energy promotes job creation in energy production and maintenance, while also reducing dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets prone to geopolitical tensions.Technological breakthroughs are also pivotal in facilitating this transition. Advances in energy storage systems, such as batteries, have enabled the storage and utilization of excess solar or wind energy during periods of low generation. These innovations enhance the reliability of renewable energy sources, making them more appealing for widespread adoption.In summary, the pressing need for environmental sustainability, the decreasing costs of renewable technologies, and ongoing advancements in energy solutions make it evident that resources like solar, wind, and water are not only feasible alternatives to fossil fuels but are likely to dominate the energy landscape in the future. Consequently, I firmly believe that the transition to renewable energy is not only achievable but essential for a sustainable future. 
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;The discussion about whether to prioritize human needs or preserve land for endangered species is complex and necessitates a thorough evaluation of the ecological balance. Although human development, including agriculture, housing, and industry, is vital for societal advancement and economic stability, I strongly believe that the preservation of habitats for endangered species should not be neglected.The connection between human well-being and ecosystem health is undeniable. Biodiversity is essential for maintaining environmental stability and resilience, and endangered species often play a crucial role in their ecosystems. The loss of these species can have severe consequences, including the disruption of food chains and the degradation of habitats that humans rely on for essential resources like clean air, water, and food. For example, the decline of bee populations poses a significant threat to pollination, which is vital for crop production and, in turn, human survival.Moreover, the expansion of human activities such as agriculture, housing, and industry often comes at the expense of wildlife habitats, resulting in irreversible biodiversity loss. Prioritizing short-term human interests without considering the long-term environmental consequences can lead to an unsustainable future. The deforestation of the Amazon rainforest for agricultural and industrial purposes is a pertinent example, as it not only affects numerous animal species but also contributes to climate change, ultimately impacting human livelihoods.It is also important to note that preserving endangered species can have significant economic benefits. The eco-tourism industry, which relies on diverse wildlife, is growing and can provide opportunities for economic gain through tourism and conservation efforts. By protecting natural habitats, we can safeguard these species while also creating opportunities for economic growth.In conclusion, while addressing human needs is essential, the preservation of land for endangered animals should not be disregarded. Finding a balance between development and conservation is not only a moral obligation but also a pragmatic approach to ensuring a sustainable future for both humans and the planet.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;In today's globalized world, acquiring a foreign language is a crucial aspect of both personal and professional growth. A common debate revolves around the benefits of learning a language in its native country versus a non-native environment, with many advocating for the superiority of learning in the country of origin due to its immersive advantages. I support this viewpoint, as it combines the benefits of cultural immersion, practical experience, and increased motivation.Primarily, learning a language in its native setting provides a comprehensive cultural immersion. This allows learners to grasp not just the language's nuances but also the customs, traditions, and daily life of its native speakers. For example, learning Spanish in Spain enables students to engage with locals, experience authentic dialects, and understand idiomatic expressions that may not translate well in a classroom elsewhere. This cultural understanding enhances both retention and practical application of the language.Additionally, learning in a foreign country facilitates everyday practice. Learners interact with native speakers, reinforcing language skills beyond the classroom. Engaging in real-world scenarios like ordering food, asking directions, or participating in social events improves fluency and confidence. In contrast, learning in a non-native country may limit such interactions, often confining learners to controlled classroom environments.Lastly, learning in an immersive environment significantly boosts motivation. The need to communicate in the target language combines urgency with exposure, compelling learners to actively engage with the language daily. For many, the desire to connect with locals and navigate daily life in a foreign language fosters a deeper commitment to mastering it.In conclusion, while learning a foreign language in any context is beneficial, immersing oneself in the language's native country offers unique advantages. The combination of cultural exposure, practical usage, and heightened motivation enhances the language acquisition experience, making it a more effective approach for many learners.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";The question of whether physical exercise should be a compulsory part of the daily school schedule or if schools should focus solely on academic pursuits has sparked a significant amount of debate in recent years. In my opinion, incorporating physical exercise into the daily school routine is vital for the comprehensive development of students.There are several key reasons why physical exercise is essential. Firstly, it is crucial for maintaining the overall health and well-being of students. Given the increasing prevalence of sedentary lifestyles among young people, largely due to the rise of technology, it is more important than ever to encourage physical activity from an early age. Regular exercise has numerous health benefits, including improved heart health, stronger muscles and bones, and more effective weight management. By making exercise a part of the school day, schools can play a significant role in combating obesity and other health issues that affect many young people today.In addition to its physical benefits, exercise also has a significant impact on mental health. Participating in sports and fitness activities can help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, boost mood, and increase self-esteem among students. Exercise has also been shown to improve concentration and cognitive function, leading to better academic performance. Therefore, physical activity should not be viewed as merely a physical outlet, but as an essential component that supports and enhances academic learning.Furthermore, physical activity helps develop important life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership. Through participating in team sports and group exercises, students learn to work together, develop resilience, and manage stress, all of which are crucial skills that extend beyond the classroom and prepare students for the challenges they will face in life.In conclusion, while academic studies are undoubtedly crucial, prioritizing physical exercise in schools is essential for developing healthier, happier, and more well-rounded individuals. A balanced approach that combines academic studies with physical fitness will ultimately provide students with the necessary tools to succeed in all areas of life.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;The debate surrounding teenagers holding jobs while still in school has gained significant attention worldwide in recent years. Although some people believe that part-time employment can hinder academic achievement, I strongly argue that having a job during adolescence offers numerous benefits and should be supported, as long as it is managed effectively.Primarily, working while studying enables teenagers to acquire vital life skills, such as time management, organization, and prioritization, which are essential for both academic success and future professional pursuits. For example, a teenager who successfully balances part-time work with school responsibilities develops the ability to manage multiple tasks, a highly valued skill in today's fast-paced environment.Furthermore, part-time employment provides teenagers with hands-on experience and valuable insights into the professional world. It introduces them to the realities of working environments, fostering a sense of responsibility and independence. For instance, a student working in a restaurant or as a cashier gains experience in customer service, teamwork, and financial management, all of which complement classroom learning and enhance personal growth.Additionally, having a job can alleviate financial pressures on teenagers and their families. Many students use their earnings to cover expenses such as school supplies, extracurricular activities, or college savings, promoting a sense of financial responsibility and money management awareness. These skills are crucial as they transition into adulthood.However, it is crucial to maintain a balance between work and academic responsibilities. Excessive work hours can lead to burnout and negatively impact academic performance. Therefore, it is essential for schools and parents to guide students in finding suitable job opportunities that do not compromise their educational goals.In conclusion, while there are legitimate concerns about the potential drawbacks of teenagers working during their studies, the benefits of skill development, practical experience, and financial independence outweigh these concerns. With proper guidance and support, part-time employment can be a valuable stepping stone for teenagers as they navigate their path to adulthood.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;The discussion surrounding the benefits and drawbacks of zoos is a multifaceted issue, with proponents arguing that they serve as vital institutions for conservation, education, and research. However, I firmly believe that the practice of keeping animals in zoos raises significant ethical concerns that supersede the potential advantages. On one hand, zoos claim to contribute meaningfully to the conservation of species, particularly those that are endangered. They undertake breeding programs aimed at boosting population numbers and eventually reintroducing these animals into their natural habitats. Although this goal is admirable, the reality is that a substantial number of zoos function primarily as entertainment venues, where profit takes precedence over genuine conservation endeavors. Moreover, research indicates that animals bred in captivity frequently struggle to adapt to life in the wild, which undermines the effectiveness of these conservation efforts.On the other hand, the ethical implications of confining animals in zoos cannot be overlooked. Many species exhibit intricate behaviors that underscore their advanced intelligence and complex social structures. Yet, these animals are often confined to limited enclosures in zoos that fail to replicate their natural environments. This dearth of space and stimulation can lead to psychological distress and unnatural behaviors, a phenomenon known as zoochosis. This situation poses a profound moral question: Can we justify the confinement of creatures with such intricate lives solely for the purpose of human education or entertainment?Furthermore, technological advancements have made available alternative methods for educating the public about wildlife, thereby circumventing the ethical dilemmas associated with zoos. Virtual reality experiences, documentaries, and observations of wildlife in their natural habitats enable people to engage with nature without the need for zoos.In conclusion, although zoos may provide certain educational and conservation benefits, the ethical ramifications of confining animals are considerable. Rather than supporting institutions that may cause harm to animals, we should champion more compassionate and effective alternatives that acknowledge and respect the natural behaviors and habitats of these creatures.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;The decision to study alone or in a group often reflects a person's individual learning style and personality. For me, studying alone is the preferred method, and there are several key reasons why it enhances my learning experience.One major advantage of studying alone is the ability to focus and concentrate without distractions. In a quiet environment, free from the disruptions that can come with group study sessions, such as unrelated conversations or differing work speeds, I can fully immerse myself in the material. For instance, when preparing for exams, I've found that studying alone allows me to cover topics in greater depth and retain the information more effectively, as I can work at my own pace. This uninterrupted focus enables me to engage with the material on a deeper level, which in turn enhances my understanding and ability to remember it.Another significant benefit of solo studying is the flexibility it offers. I can customize my study sessions to fit my specific needs, choosing which subjects to prioritize, how much time to allocate to each, and taking breaks as necessary, all without being tied to a group schedule. Last semester, when I was struggling with complex math concepts, I was able to devote extra time to practicing challenging problems, a freedom that might not have been possible in a group setting where time is typically divided among multiple subjects and individual requirements.Furthermore, studying alone promotes independence and self-reliance, traits that are not only beneficial in academics but also invaluable throughout life. As I navigate my educational path, I develop the skills to find resources, solve problems, and trust in my own abilities, all without dependency on others.In comparison, although studying in a group can offer advantages like collaborative learning and diverse viewpoints, for me, the downsides often outweigh these benefits. Consequently, studying alone perfectly aligns with my need for focus, flexibility, and self-discipline, leading to a more effective and satisfying educational experience.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;The decision to spend time with either a small, close-knit group of friends or a larger social circle offers distinct advantages, catering to individual preferences and social requirements. Opting for a smaller circle of friends allows for more profound and personal interactions. This choice facilitates meaningful conversations, emotional support, and trust development. With fewer individuals involved, it becomes easier to share personal thoughts, seek guidance, and participate in activities that require a higher level of comfort and understanding. Close friends are often more empathetic towards each other, creating a supportive environment where individuals feel appreciated and understood.In contrast, socializing with a larger group of friends can expose individuals to a broader range of viewpoints and experiences. This option is ideal for expanding one's social network, thereby enhancing social skills and adaptability. Larger group settings can also create a dynamic atmosphere filled with shared laughter and diverse activities that may not be possible in smaller gatherings. Furthermore, a larger friend circle can provide a sense of security, as the loss of one friendship can be mitigated by the presence of many others.On a personal note, I have a preference for spending time with a small, close group of friends. This stems from my emphasis on the quality of relationships over their quantity. I find it easier to form strong bonds, offer support during challenging times, and engage in discussions that foster mutual growth in smaller groups. Although I occasionally enjoy the energy of larger gatherings, the deeper connections I cultivate with a select few bring me greater fulfillment and happiness.In conclusion, both options offer unique benefits, with smaller, intimate gatherings facilitating deep connections and larger groups providing social diversity. Ultimately, one's personal inclinations determine the preferred choice in how time is spent with friends.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The allocation of government funds for either road and highway development or the enhancement of public transportation systems is a pressing concern in modern urban planning and infrastructure management. Although both alternatives have their merits, a balanced approach that prioritizes public transportation presents a forward-thinking and sustainable solution to the mobility challenges faced by expanding populations.Investing in public transportation, including buses, trains, and subways, tackles multiple societal issues. As urban populations grow, congestion increases, and enhancing public transportation offers an efficient alternative to private vehicle usage, thereby alleviating congestion. Research indicates that robust public transit systems correlate with reduced traffic congestion, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and improved air quality, contributing to healthier urban environments.Furthermore, public transportation fosters social equity by providing mobility to those without access to private vehicles, predominantly low-income individuals. This facilitates access to employment, education, and community activities, promoting economic opportunities and bridging social gaps.In contrast, excessive expenditure on road and highway improvements may yield short-term benefits but neglects long-term sustainability. Expanding road capacity can exacerbate car dependency and urban sprawl, ultimately leading to increased traffic and pollution. Moreover, diverting funds to highway projects can undermine public transit initiatives, resulting in a fragmented transportation system.Ultimately, while road and highway maintenance is necessary, prioritizing public transportation investment is vital for sustainable urban growth. By promoting public transit, governments can create more efficient, equitable, and environmentally friendly cities, laying the groundwork for resilient communities in the future.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;The discussion about keeping animals in zoos has become more popular recently, with more and more people thinking that animals should be free and not locked up. I completely agree that animals should not be kept in zoos because it takes away their natural behaviors, homes, and freedom.One reason for this is that animals in zoos often don't have enough space or things to do, which can cause mental health problems. In the wild, animals do important things like hunting, finding food, and interacting with each other to survive. Zoos, on the other hand, can be too small and fake, which doesn't meet the animals' emotional and physical needs. For example, elephants, which are supposed to move around a lot, can develop serious behavioral problems like walking back and forth or being aggressive when they are kept in small spaces.Another reason is that zoos often care more about entertaining people than about the animals' well-being. The main goal of a zoo is to attract visitors, which can lead to poor living conditions for the animals. Rare animals are often shown off to create a show, but this can ignore the animals' natural instincts and make them feel bad about themselves. A good example of this is the famous case of polar bears being kept in warm places, where they struggle to adapt and get health problems.Some people might say that zoos are good for learning about wild animals, but this argument is not strong enough. While zoos might provide a way to learn about wildlife, they don't give a real understanding of these animals in their natural homes. To really protect animals, we should focus on saving their homes and the systems they live in, rather than keeping them in zoos.In summary, I strongly believe that animals should be free and not kept in zoos. Keeping them locked up leads to bad effects on their minds, hurts their well-being, and is not a true way to protect them. Instead, we should support efforts that save natural homes and let wild animals thrive where they belong.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;In light of my country's developmental goals and economic aspirations, I strongly advocate for the establishment of an agricultural research center. Although business research has the potential to drive economic growth, agriculture plays a vital role in our economy, food supply, and environmental conservation. By concentrating on agricultural research, we can address both short-term and long-term challenges that our society is currently facing.Agriculture is the mainstay of our economy, providing employment opportunities for a significant portion of the population and ensuring food security. Investing in agricultural research enables us to improve crop yields, adopt sustainable farming practices, and incorporate modern technologies into agricultural production. This approach not only guarantees that we can meet the food needs of our population but also enhances the livelihoods of numerous farmers who rely on outdated methods that are not adapted to the changing climate.Furthermore, agricultural research can facilitate the discovery of innovative solutions to pressing environmental concerns, including soil erosion, water scarcity, and climate change. For example, research on drought-tolerant crops and eco-friendly pest management systems can assist farmers in mitigating the effects of climate fluctuations. These advancements will lead to a more resilient agricultural sector that can maintain productivity despite environmental challenges.Additionally, supporting an agricultural research center can elevate our country's global reputation. As the international community increasingly focuses on sustainability and food security, having a dedicated agricultural research center positions us to contribute to global discussions on best practices and innovations in agriculture. This, in turn, can attract international partnerships and funding, leading to further advancements and collaboration opportunities.In summary, while a business research center may offer some advantages, prioritizing an agricultural research center will have profound implications for economic stability, environmental sustainability, and food security. This focus is aligned with our country's core needs and provides a pathway toward a more resilient future for both farmers and the broader community.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;The process of learning is complex and varied, and individuals often have unique preferences for how they acquire new information. For me, learning through hands-on experience, or experiential learning, has proven to be the most effective approach. This method not only engages my senses but also helps to solidify concepts in a way that traditional reading or listening cannot match.My experience with hands-on learning began in high school, where I participated in a science fair project that allowed me to explore chemical reactions in a practical way. By conducting experiments and observing the results firsthand, I gained a deeper understanding of chemistry principles than I would have through passive learning alone. The process of mixing substances, observing reactions, and recording results helped to make complex concepts more tangible and memorable, giving me a clearer understanding of how different chemicals interact.I also had the opportunity to apply this learning style during an internship at a local community center, where I was responsible for organizing events. While initial training sessions provided a foundation, the real learning took place when I was actively involved in planning and executing events. This immersive experience allowed me to hone my organizational skills, adapt to unexpected challenges, and learn from my mistakes in a way that would not have been possible through reading alone.In summary, while there are many effective learning methods, including reading and listening, I have found that learning by doing resonates with me the most. This approach not only enhances my understanding of concepts but also develops critical skills that are essential for practical applications. As I move forward in my educational journey, I plan to actively seek out opportunities for experiential learning, as I believe this method will lead to more profound and lasting knowledge.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;"The discussion around budget air travel is complex and has multiple facets. On one hand, it has made traveling more accessible to the general public, allowing people from different socioeconomic backgrounds to explore new places. This increased accessibility has fostered cultural exchange, promoted tourism in underdeveloped areas, and expanded individuals' perspectives, ultimately boosting the global economy. For many people, traveling is not just a luxury, but also a chance for self-discovery and adventure, which contributes to a more interconnected world.On the other hand, critics point out the negative environmental impact of mass air travel. The aviation industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which accelerates climate change and affects air quality. As air travel becomes more affordable, more people are flying, resulting in increased air traffic and more strain on the planet's resources. Environmentalists argue that the rise of cheap flights could hinder efforts to combat climate change and suggest that making air travel more expensive could discourage unnecessary flights and promote more sustainable transportation methods, such as trains or buses.In my view, while budget air travel has undeniable benefits, it's crucial to find a balance between accessibility and environmental sustainability. Encouraging responsible travel practices, such as carbon pricing or incentives for eco-friendly transportation, would allow people to travel without causing significant harm to the environment. Additionally, raising awareness about the ecological impact of flying could encourage travelers to make more thoughtful decisions when planning their trips. Ultimately, supporting sustainable practices doesn't limit the freedom to travel; it ensures that future generations can have the same experiences without jeopardizing the planet's health."
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;The debate over whether governments should prioritize funding for road and highway improvements or public transportation systems is a complex issue that depends on various factors, including environmental considerations, urban planning, and the overall efficiency of transportation networks. Although both areas require investment, it is becoming increasingly evident that public transportation should be the primary focus.The main argument in favor of investing in public transportation is its ability to alleviate traffic congestion and mitigate its negative environmental impact. While roads and highways are crucial for the movement of goods and people, they can lead to urban expansion and increased dependence on personal vehicles. By enhancing public transit infrastructure, such as buses, trains, and subways, governments can offer viable alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles. Effective public transportation systems can substantially reduce the number of cars on the road, resulting in lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. This is especially important in the context of climate change, as cities aim to achieve sustainability goals.In addition to its environmental benefits, investing in public transportation can also promote social equity. Many low-income individuals rely on public transit due to lack of access to private vehicles, making it essential for accessing employment, education, and healthcare. By prioritizing public transportation, governments can foster inclusivity and economic mobility, ultimately benefiting the entire society.Moreover, improved public transportation can drive economic growth by creating jobs and enhancing access to various regions. A well-connected public transportation system can attract businesses, stimulate local development, and lead to a more vibrant economy.In summary, while upgrading roads and highways is undoubtedly necessary, the long-term advantages of investing in public transportation - including environmental sustainability, social equity, and economic growth - make it the more sensible choice for government expenditure. As urban populations continue to grow, the demand for efficient, reliable, and sustainable transportation options will become increasingly pressing.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;The age-old debate among students is whether to study individually or in a group setting, with each approach having its own set of benefits. From my perspective, I find that studying alone is the most effective method for me, as it grants me the autonomy to focus intensely, tailor my study approach to suit my needs, and progress at my own speed.Solo studying creates an environment that is conducive to deep concentration. Without the distractions that often come with group study sessions, such as conversations and differing viewpoints, I can fully immerse myself in my studies. This concentrated approach allows me to thoroughly explore complex subjects, understand intricate ideas, and retain information more efficiently. For example, when preparing for exams, I often retreat to a quiet space where I can review my notes and textbooks uninterrupted. This peaceful setting significantly enhances my understanding and facilitates a more effective absorption of knowledge.Another significant advantage of studying alone is the ability to personalize my study methods. Given that each student has a unique learning style, while some may thrive in discussion-based learning environments, I have found that visual tools, flashcards, and note-taking are the strategies that work best for me. This customized approach to learning is not only more fulfilling but also more productive, as it enables me to experiment with different techniques without having to adapt to a group consensus. A notable instance of this was during my preparation for a history exam, where I created mind maps to connect themes and timelines - an approach that would have been difficult to implement in a group setting.Lastly, studying by myself helps foster independence and self-discipline. I learn to manage my time effectively, set personal targets, and overcome challenges on my own. This skill is beneficial not only for academic success but also for future professional responsibilities, equipping me with the tools necessary to succeed in various aspects of life.Although group studying can offer the benefits of collaboration and diverse viewpoints, I firmly believe that solo studying aligns best with my academic preferences and learning style. It allows me to maximize my potential and achieve my academic goals in the most effective manner possible.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";The discussion about the effects of human behavior on the Earth is complex, with credible arguments on both sides. Nevertheless, I strongly believe that human actions have caused considerable harm to the planet, resulting in negative consequences that surpass any beneficial effects.Firstly, the process of industrialization has had a devastating impact on the environment. The emission of greenhouse gases from factories, vehicles, and power plants has severely affected the Earth's atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that these emissions are a primary cause of climate change, leading to extreme weather conditions, rising sea levels, and a loss of biodiversity. The increasing frequency of natural disasters illustrates that the planet is struggling to cope with the consequences of human behavior.Furthermore, deforestation resulting from logging, agriculture, and urban expansion has led to the destruction of crucial ecosystems. Forests, which serve as carbon sinks, are being depleted at an alarming rate. The loss of trees not only contributes to increased carbon dioxide levels but also endangers numerous species that rely on these habitats for survival. The extinction of species disrupts the delicate balance of our ecosystems, posing additional risks to human survival.On the other hand, proponents of human progress argue that technological advancements and infrastructure development have improved living standards. Although it is true that medical and technological innovations can enhance the quality of life, these benefits often come at a significant environmental cost. For example, the conveniences of modern life often lead to increased waste and pollution, undermining the foundations of a healthy planet.In conclusion, while human behavior has led to improvements in certain aspects of life, the overwhelming evidence of environmental degradation suggests that human actions are causing more harm than good to the Earth. To ensure a sustainable future for generations to come, it is essential to acknowledge the impact of our actions, adopt more environmentally friendly practices, and prioritize the health of our planet.
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";"When a company is faced with the decision of allocating funds to either support the arts or protect the environment, it is essential to consider the long-term consequences of this choice. In light of the growing urgency of environmental concerns, I firmly believe that the company will opt to prioritize environmental protection, and there are several compelling arguments that support this decision.Primarily, the escalating global climate crisis has intensified awareness and a sense of urgency around environmental issues. The far-reaching consequences of neglecting environmental protection, ranging from extreme weather events to biodiversity loss, are unmistakable. As a result, companies are increasingly acknowledging their duty to adopt sustainable and eco-friendly practices. By investing in environmental initiatives, the company can make a significant contribution to combating climate change and ensuring a healthier planet for future generations.Furthermore, prioritizing environmental protection can enhance the company's reputation and appeal to a broader customer base. Modern consumers are more aware of corporate social responsibility and tend to prefer engaging with businesses that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. By investing in environmental protection, the company not only makes a positive impact on society but also fosters brand loyalty and trust among environmentally conscious consumers.Additionally, funding environmental projects can create opportunities for innovation and growth. Investing in renewable energy, conservation technologies, and sustainable agriculture can attract talented individuals and stimulate creative solutions. This shift towards sustainability can drive economic growth while addressing pressing issues, presenting a win-win scenario for both the company and the environment.In comparison, while funding the arts is undoubtedly valuable for preserving cultural heritage and enriching communities, it may not possess the same level of urgency as environmental protection in the current context. The interconnection between environmental health and quality of life affects all aspects of society, including the arts; a deteriorated environment can hinder artistic expression and the appreciation of cultural outputs.In conclusion, considering the pressing nature of environmental challenges, the positive implications for business, and the potential for innovative growth, I strongly believe that the company will choose to allocate its funds towards protecting the environment."
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;In modern workplaces, characterized by diversity and constant change, the presence of effective coworkers plays a pivotal role in boosting productivity, enhancing morale, and ensuring overall job satisfaction. An exceptional coworker is distinguished by several key attributes, including the ability to communicate effectively, being reliable, and adaptable.Effective communication is the cornerstone of successful teamwork. A coworker who excels in articulating their thoughts and actively listening creates an environment conducive to collaboration and creativity. For example, within a marketing team, when a member effectively communicates innovative ideas and provides constructive feedback, it not only stimulates dialogue but also fosters a culture of innovation. Clear communication has the dual benefit of streamlining tasks and minimizing misunderstandings, thereby leading to more efficient outcomes. Therefore, prioritizing ongoing communication and clarifying expectations is essential for promoting a unified team effort.Reliability is another vital trait of a commendable coworker. Individuals who consistently honor their commitments and meet deadlines cultivate trust among team members. This reliability is particularly crucial in projects where the stakes are high and each member's contribution is interdependent. For instance, in a research team, a member known for delivering well-researched data on time reassures the team that their collective objectives will be achieved. When coworkers can count on one another, it significantly enhances team productivity and fosters a supportive and dependable work culture.Adaptability is also a crucial quality, especially in fast-paced work environments where changes are frequent and unpredictable. A coworker who is open to challenges and adept at adjusting to new situations can guide the team through unforeseen obstacles. For example, in the ever-evolving tech industry, when a product development strategy needs to pivot due to emerging trends, an adaptable coworker can swiftly adjust plans, ensuring the project remains on course. Their readiness to embrace change alleviates potential stress and drives innovation, contributing to the team's resilience and success.In conclusion, the attributes of effective communication, reliability, and adaptability are fundamental to being a successful and valued coworker. These qualities contribute significantly to a positive and productive work environment, leading to both personal and collective success within any organization. By embodying these traits, coworkers can elevate their team's performance, foster a collaborative spirit, and navigate the challenges of a dynamic work landscape with greater ease and effectiveness.
202;When people succeed it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success. Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.First, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.Secondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. Thirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. Although it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.;"The idea that success is exclusively the result of hard work, with no consideration of luck, is a debated issue. Although I recognize the importance of diligent effort in attaining goals, I do not agree that luck has no impact on success. A more refined perspective acknowledges that success often involves a intricate combination of hard work and fortunate events.Primarily, hard work is undoubtedly crucial for achieving success. Individuals who commit to their pursuits, whether in academics, sports, or business, are more likely to acquire the necessary skills, resilience, and discipline to excel. For example, notable figures like Thomas Edison, who famously said, ""Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration,"" demonstrate how unrelenting effort can lead to groundbreaking accomplishments. Edison's development of the electric light bulb was the result of numerous experiments and a tireless work ethic.Nevertheless, the influence of luck on success cannot be entirely disregarded. An individual may work diligently yet still be subject to circumstances beyond their control. Consider, for instance, a gifted athlete who trains exceptionally hard. Despite their dedication, they may not qualify for the Olympics if they suffer an injury or if other competitors unexpectedly outperform them. Furthermore, factors such as socioeconomic background, connections, and timing often determine the opportunities available to individuals, implying that even the most hardworking individuals may benefit from a favorable turn of events.In conclusion, while hard work is a fundamental element of success, the significance of luck should not be underestimated. An individual's path to achievement is often shaped by a multitude of factors, creating a complex interplay of effort and fortunate circumstances. Recognizing this complexity enables a more comprehensive understanding of what it means to achieve success."
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;The emergence of technology has revolutionized the education sector in recent years, sparking a heated debate about whether online learning and computer-based classes should supplant traditional classroom instruction. Although both approaches have their strengths, the trend towards online education seems to offer unique benefits that can enrich the learning experience for a significant number of students.One major advantage of distance learning is its unparalleled flexibility. Conventional classrooms are often bound by inflexible scheduling, requiring students to attend classes at specific times and locations. In contrast, online courses provide learners with the freedom to access study materials and complete assignments at their own pace and convenience. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for non-traditional students, such as working professionals or those with family commitments, who may find it challenging to attend scheduled classes. By allowing education to be tailored to individual schedules, the distance learning model promotes a more inclusive learning environment and expands opportunities for a wider range of participants.Furthermore, online education can cater to diverse learning preferences. Digital learning platforms frequently incorporate multimedia resources, including videos, interactive quizzes, and discussion forums, which can enhance comprehension and engagement. This variety enables students to customize their learning experience according to their individual preferences, potentially leading to improved knowledge retention and mastery. Additionally, many online courses utilize adaptive learning technologies that can analyze a student's progress and tailor the learning experience to meet their specific needs.Nonetheless, it is essential to recognize the importance of face-to-face interactions that are characteristic of traditional classrooms. In-person engagement fosters a sense of community, collaboration, and social skills development, all of which are crucial for building network connections. Therefore, while online learning offers numerous advantages, it should be seen as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, traditional education.In conclusion, distance learning and online classes offer significant benefits, primarily in terms of flexibility and personalized learning experiences. As educational institutions continue to integrate technology into their curricula, a balanced approach that combines the strengths of both online and in-person learning could lead to the most effective educational outcomes.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The question of whether university students should be required to attend classes or have the freedom to choose their attendance is a pressing concern in modern higher education. Although both sides of the argument have valid points, I strongly believe that mandatory attendance is essential for students.Attending classes provides a structured learning environment that promotes academic discipline, which is the primary reason I support mandatory attendance. With numerous responsibilities competing for their attention, students often find university life overwhelming. By making attendance compulsory, students are forced to prioritize their education, developing vital habits like punctuality, organization, and responsibility. This structured approach is especially beneficial for younger students or those transitioning from high school, where attendance is closely monitored.Another significant advantage of mandatory attendance is that it encourages engagement and interaction among peers and professors. The classroom setting facilitates discussion, critical thinking, and collaborative learning, all of which are difficult to replicate through solo study or online resources. Engaging with diverse perspectives and asking questions in real-time fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter, crucial for mastering complex topics. Moreover, relationships formed in the classroom can lead to valuable networking opportunities and collaborations that enhance students' educational experiences and future careers.Moreover, the skills acquired in a classroom setting go beyond academic knowledge. Essential competencies like interpersonal communication, teamwork, and public speaking are vital in any professional setting. Mandatory attendance ensures that students actively participate in these crucial learning experiences, developing skills that will benefit them throughout their lives.In conclusion, while flexibility in learning may be appealing, the benefits of mandatory class attendance, including discipline, engagement, and skill development, outweigh the drawbacks. By requiring students to attend classes, universities are not only preparing them for academic success but also for their future careers and personal growth, providing them with a comprehensive education that extends beyond the classroom.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;As I weigh the pros and cons of residing in a small town versus a big city, I am drawn to the quaint and serene atmosphere of a small town. Several factors contribute to the allure of small-town living, including a deep sense of community, a more leisurely pace of life, and a profound connection to the natural world.One of the primary advantages of small-town living is the close-knit community that often develops. Neighbors typically know and look out for one another, fostering a supportive environment that enhances overall well-being. This sense of belonging can be particularly meaningful, as it facilitates social connections and support networks through community events, casual encounters, and local gatherings - all of which can be more challenging to establish in the impersonal setting of a big city.Additionally, the pace of life in small towns is often more laid-back. Without the constant commotion of urban life, residents can savor a more tranquil lifestyle, which is associated with reduced stress levels. This peaceful atmosphere allows individuals to appreciate life's simple pleasures, such as strolling through the park or spending quality time with loved ones.Furthermore, small towns frequently feature stunning natural scenery and a wide range of outdoor recreational activities. The proximity to nature promotes a healthier way of living, as residents can engage in pursuits like cycling, hiking, or merely taking in the beauty of their surroundings. The relative absence of pollution and noise that characterizes larger cities also contributes to a more serene living experience.In summary, although big cities undoubtedly have their own set of benefits, the charms of small-town living - including its strong sense of community, relaxed pace of life, and harmonious connection with nature - resonate more deeply with my personal values and preferences. I firmly believe that residing in a small town offers the perfect setting for achieving personal fulfillment and well-being.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;"The migration of young individuals from rural areas to urban centers has emerged as a prominent trend globally, driven by the quest for enhanced educational prospects, higher income potential, and a more dynamic social experience. This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors, including the pursuit of superior educational opportunities, the lure of greater financial rewards, and the promise of a more vibrant social life.A primary driver of this migration is the disparity in educational resources between urban and rural areas. Cities are often home to renowned universities, diverse vocational training institutions, and a wide range of extracurricular activities, all of which can significantly enrich a young person's educational experience. In contrast, rural schools frequently grapple with constraints related to funding, resources, and advanced academic programs, prompting many young individuals to seek better educational environments in cities.Economic considerations also play a pivotal role in this trend. Urban areas typically boast a broader spectrum of job opportunities with potentially higher salaries compared to rural areas, which often struggle with limited employment prospects. The allure of financial autonomy and career advancement is a potent motivator, particularly for young individuals eager to establish themselves in the workforce.However, the migration to urban centers is not without its drawbacks. The exodus of young people from rural areas can lead to a decline in local economies, exacerbating issues such as underemployment and reduced community services. Furthermore, urban life presents its own set of challenges, including a higher cost of living, overcrowding, and intensified competition for jobs.In conclusion, the migration of young people from rural to urban areas is primarily driven by the pursuit of superior educational and job opportunities. While this trend yields economic benefits and personal growth potential for individuals, it also has the potential to deplete rural communities and create urban challenges. It is essential to strike a balance between these dynamics; thus, while the advantages may outweigh the disadvantages at an individual level, the broader implications for rural areas necessitate careful consideration and strategic interventions to ensure the prosperity of both environments."
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;I firmly believe that introducing a basic economics course into high school curricula is crucial. As the world becomes more interconnected and complex, it's essential for young individuals to grasp economic principles to successfully navigate their future, both personally and professionally.Primarily, studying basic economics provides students with vital life skills. Understanding concepts like supply and demand, budgeting, and financial literacy enables them to make informed decisions about their spending and saving habits. In a society where consumerism prevails and young people are constantly exposed to advertisements promoting impulse buying, having a grasp of economic principles helps them differentiate between their needs and wants. As they transition into adulthood, this knowledge becomes indispensable, allowing them to manage their finances effectively, plan for higher education, and comprehend the implications of debts or loans.Moreover, economics offers a framework for students to understand broader societal issues. Topics like unemployment, inflation, and government policies have a direct impact on their lives, yet often seem abstract without formal education. By learning how these factors interact, students can become more informed citizens, engage in meaningful policy discussions, and participate in the democratic process with a deeper understanding of how economic decisions affect communities.Additionally, a basic economics course can spark an interest in the subject, potentially motivating students to pursue careers in fields like finance, business, or public policy. With a solid foundation in economics, students are better equipped to contribute positively to the economy upon graduating, whether as entrepreneurs, informed voters, or responsible consumers.In conclusion, incorporating basic economics into high school curricula is not only beneficial, but necessary. It promotes critical thinking, equips students with practical skills, and fosters an understanding of the economic forces that shape our world.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The debate about whether higher education should be exclusive to top-performing students or made available to a broader range of young individuals is highly contentious, with valid arguments on both sides. However, I firmly believe that a more inclusive higher education system benefits society as a whole.At first glance, limiting university access to high-achieving students appears reasonable, as they often exhibit strong motivation, academic ability, and the capacity to excel in demanding academic environments. Advocates of this approach argue that by concentrating resources on the most talented students, institutions can uphold high academic standards, ensuring graduates are well-equipped for challenging professional roles. Nevertheless, this viewpoint overlooks the diverse range of talents and potential that exist beyond conventional academic measurements.On the other hand, providing broader access to higher education promotes a more equitable society. Many young people possess unique skills, life experiences, and viewpoints that enhance the academic environment, even if they do not thrive in traditional academic settings. By enabling a diverse range of students to pursue higher education, society benefits from a more varied and skilled workforce. Furthermore, education is not solely focused on academic achievement, but also on personal development, critical thinking, and social growth. Access to higher education can transform individuals' lives, equipping them with the necessary tools to contribute positively to their communities.In conclusion, although there are legitimate arguments for restricting higher education to top-performing students, the benefits of inclusivity and diversity in education outweigh these considerations. By providing opportunities to a wider range of young people, we foster a more vibrant and dynamic society that values the potential of every individual.
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The old saying ""prevention is better than cure"" highlights a vital principle in healthcare that promotes taking a proactive approach to managing health. I strongly believe that a large part of a country's healthcare budget should be spent on health education and preventive measures rather than treatment. This change in approach has significant effects on public health, economic efficiency, and the overall quality of life.To start with, investing in health education can greatly reduce the number of cases of diseases that can be prevented. By teaching people about healthy habits like good food, exercise, and taking care of their minds, they are more likely to make choices that reduce their chances of getting long-term diseases like diabetes, heart problems, and being overweight. For example, campaigns that encourage people to be physically active and eat well can lead to a healthier population, which reduces the pressure on healthcare systems caused by diseases that can be prevented.Furthermore, preventive measures are often cheaper than treatment. Healthcare systems that focus on prevention, such as giving people shots to prevent diseases and doing health checks, can greatly reduce the long-term financial burden of treating diseases that are advanced. By finding health problems early, we can avoid expensive hospital stays and complicated medical procedures, which saves public money that can be used for more preventive programs.In addition, a healthy population is more productive and helps the economy grow. When people are not sick, they can contribute more to society, which means fewer sick days and more people working. This not only makes the economy stronger but also improves the well-being of the community as a whole.In summary, using a large part of healthcare budgets for education and preventive measures is a smart strategy that follows the principles of being sustainable and proactive in managing health. By prioritizing prevention, countries can create healthier communities, reduce costs, and improve the quality of life for their people, making this approach not just better, but necessary."
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;The idea of removing non-academic subjects from school curricula to focus solely on academic subjects has gained momentum in recent years. However, despite the undeniable pressure on students to perform well academically, I firmly believe that subjects like physical education and cooking should remain part of educational programs.The inclusion of non-academic subjects in the curriculum is vital for the comprehensive development of students. For instance, physical education promotes physical fitness, teamwork, and mental well-being, all of which are crucial for maintaining a balanced lifestyle. Research has shown that regular physical activity improves concentration and cognitive function, which in turn can have a positive impact on academic performance. Rather than hindering academic success, physical education can actually enhance it by ensuring students maintain physical and mental health.In addition to physical education, practical subjects such as cooking provide students with essential life skills. In today's health-conscious world, teaching students how to prepare nutritious meals is vital. This knowledge encourages independence, boosts self-esteem, and promotes healthier eating habits, ultimately leading to better academic and physical health outcomes. Cooking also fosters creativity, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking, all of which are valuable in academic disciplines.The intense pressure to excel academically can lead to burnout and mental health issues among students. Non-academic subjects provide a necessary break from the rigorous academic demands, helping to alleviate stress and anxiety. They create a more diverse and balanced learning environment where students can express themselves, explore their interests, and develop essential social skills.In conclusion, although academic success is important, eliminating non-academic subjects from school curricula would be detrimental to students' overall growth and development. A well-rounded education that incorporates both physical and practical subjects is essential for nurturing individuals who are equipped to succeed in all aspects of life.
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When individuals immigrate to a new country, they are often confronted with the decision of whether to assimilate into the local culture or preserve their native customs. This dilemma presents a unique set of benefits and drawbacks, influenced by varying perspectives on identity, belonging, and the process of integration.Assimilating into the new culture can facilitate a smoother transition into society and foster a sense of belonging among immigrants. By engaging with local customs, language, and social norms, newcomers can establish relationships with native-born citizens, form friendships, and strengthen community bonds. For example, participating in local festivals and holidays can provide immigrants with a deeper understanding of their new environment and enhance their connections with the community. Moreover, adapting to the host country's customs can also improve job prospects, as employers often favor candidates who demonstrate cultural awareness and can integrate seamlessly into the company culture.In contrast, preserving one's native customs provides a sense of continuity and identity, which is vital for navigating the challenges of relocation. Cultural heritage can offer comfort and stability in an unfamiliar environment, enabling immigrants to maintain a connection to their roots. This choice promotes cultural diversity within the host country, as diverse customs can bring unique perspectives and practices that enrich the social fabric. For instance, immigrants who observe their native festivals contribute to multiculturalism, enriching the local culture and fostering tolerance and understanding among different communities.From a personal standpoint, I advocate for a balanced approach that combines elements of the new culture with the preservation of one's own heritage. This blended identity can foster personal growth, encourage intercultural dialogue, and promote mutual respect. By navigating both cultural realms, individuals can celebrate their roots while adapting to their new surroundings, ultimately enriching both their personal lives and the communities they join. This hybrid approach allows immigrants to embrace the benefits of both worlds, creating a rich and diverse experience that enhances their sense of belonging and identity.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;The ability to work efficiently, both independently and in a team, is a vital skill in academic and professional environments. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that the ability to collaborate with others is more significant. This belief stems from the numerous benefits of teamwork, including the exchange of diverse perspectives, heightened creativity, and the development of essential interpersonal skills.Collaboration offers numerous advantages, primarily the opportunity to draw from a wide range of experiences and viewpoints. Each team member brings their distinct knowledge and skills to the table, often resulting in groundbreaking solutions to intricate problems. For example, in a marketing class group project, students from different backgrounds and interests may contribute varied insights, culminating in a multifaceted campaign that surpasses what one individual could have achieved alone. The fusion of ideas frequently yields superior outcomes that exceed individual capabilities.Furthermore, teamwork cultivates a sense of community, promoting effective communication and interpersonal skills. In the modern workforce, collaboration is the norm, with most projects requiring teamwork to align with corporate objectives. For instance, in a corporate setting, employees must frequently collaborate to achieve shared goals, enhancing work quality, building trust, and fortifying relationships that are crucial for future endeavors.Although working independently has its benefits, such as promoting personal accountability and individual creativity, the capacity to collaborate effectively has become more valuable in an increasingly interconnected world. Successful projects often rely on the synergy generated by teamwork, leading to heightened morale and a shared sense of accomplishment.In conclusion, while independent work is an essential skill, the benefits of teamwork make it a critical competency in today's environment. The ability to collaborate effectively enhances creativity, problem-solving, and prepares individuals for success in a world that is becoming increasingly cooperative.
213;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Use examples and specific reasons to support your position.;Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.First of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.Furthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. Lastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. To conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.;I firmly believe that smoking should be banned in restaurants and that state laws prohibiting it should be enforced. The negative impact of secondhand smoke on public health, the improvement of the overall dining experience, and the economic advantages of smoke-free environments all provide strong arguments in support of this position.Primarily, secondhand smoke poses a significant threat to the health of both smokers and non-smokers alike. A multitude of studies have demonstrated that exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to severe health problems, including respiratory issues, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer. When people eat in a smoke-filled environment, they involuntarily inhale toxic substances, which is a violation of their right to breathe clean air. By banning smoking in restaurants, we can protect the health of both customers and employees from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke.Furthermore, a smoke-free environment in restaurants enhances the overall dining experience. Families with children, who might otherwise avoid eating out, can enjoy their meals in a more pleasant atmosphere. Without the unpleasant smell of smoke and the discomfort it causes, diners are more likely to enjoy their meals and stay longer, which promotes a more social and enjoyable experience. This environment encourages more customers to visit restaurants, which benefits owners and employees alike.Lastly, maintaining smoke-free laws in restaurants has significant economic benefits. Research indicates that smoke-free regulations lead to increased customer numbers, as more people prefer to eat in a smoke-free environment. Restaurants can attract a broader customer base, which translates to higher revenues and job creation. In essence, smoke-free policies are beneficial not only for health but also for the economic prosperity of the food service industry.In conclusion, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants due to the health risks associated with secondhand smoke, the improvement of the dining experience, and the economic benefits resulting from smoke-free environments. Upholding state laws that prohibit smoking in these establishments is crucial for promoting a healthier, more enjoyable, and economically viable dining culture.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";Participating in hobbies and physical activities outside of one's profession is crucial for maintaining a healthy work-life balance and achieving a fulfilling life. I strongly believe that pursuing such activities is vital for several reasons.To begin with, hobbies and physical activities act as a powerful remedy for the stress and monotony that often come with a job. Many work environments are characterized by high expectations, tight deadlines, and intense pressure, which can lead to burnout if not managed properly. Engaging in activities unrelated to one's job allows individuals to create a mental and emotional barrier, providing a much-needed break from the demands of their profession. For example, someone who spends most of their time in a corporate setting may find immense relief in activities like painting or hiking, which offer a refreshing change of scenery and mental stimulation. These activities foster creativity, broader perspectives, and can even enhance job performance.Furthermore, hobbies often facilitate personal growth and skill development. They enable individuals to explore interests that promote leadership, teamwork, and resilience - essential qualities that can be transferred to the workplace. For instance, participating in team sports can improve communication and collaboration skills, while creative hobbies like writing or music can enhance problem-solving abilities.Moreover, physical activities are essential for maintaining overall health and wellbeing. Regular exercise has been proven to improve mental health, boost mood, and increase energy levels, leading to greater productivity and job satisfaction. The endorphins released during physical activities can also alleviate anxiety, helping to combat the challenges of a demanding career.In conclusion, engaging in hobbies and physical activities that are distinct from one's profession can greatly enrich personal life and positively impact work performance. Therefore, cultivating interests outside of work is a vital strategy for ensuring overall wellbeing and professional fulfillment.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;The allocation of government funds towards either road and highway improvement or the enhancement of public transportation systems is a crucial consideration in urban planning and infrastructure development. Both areas are vital for a comprehensive transit network, but prioritizing public transportation yields a multitude of benefits that enhance urban lifestyles and tackle modern societal challenges.One of the primary advantages of investing in public transportation, including buses, trains, and subways, is its potential to substantially alleviate traffic congestion. As urban populations expand, roads often become overcrowded, resulting in prolonged travel times and heightened pollution levels. The expansion and enhancement of public transit networks encourage individuals to opt for public transport over personal vehicles, thereby reducing traffic congestion and lowering emissions of greenhouse gases. Furthermore, improved public transportation systems offer a convenient mobility option for those without access to private vehicles, promoting inclusivity and mobility across all socioeconomic groups.Investing in public transportation also has profound economic implications. A well-designed public transit system enhances job accessibility, potentially leading to economic growth and reduced unemployment rates within communities. Moreover, improved public transport stimulates local economies by increasing foot traffic in commercial areas and broadening the consumer base, thereby supporting local businesses.In addition to its social and economic benefits, public transportation is often more environmentally sustainable than the expansion of road networks. The continuous maintenance and development required for highways lead to habitat destruction and increased carbon footprints. In contrast, investing in public transportation provides a greener alternative that aligns with global initiatives aimed at combating climate change.In conclusion, while the improvement of roads and highways is undoubtedly crucial for accommodating vehicular traffic, prioritizing public transportation emerges as a more strategic choice for fostering a society that is sustainable, equitable, and economically vibrant. By focusing on the development of public transit systems, governments can effectively address pressing urban challenges, minimize environmental impact, and pave the way for a more accessible and sustainable future for all citizens.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;The path to understanding life is complex and multifaceted, often traversed through the wisdom of others or the lessons learned from personal experiences. Both methods offer distinct benefits that shape one's perception of life and influence future choices.Seeking guidance from family and friends offers a wealth of knowledge rooted in shared experiences and lessons learned. The people closest to us often provide valuable insights based on their own life struggles, successes, and failures, serving as a crucial source of support and wisdom. This approach has two main advantages: it promotes a sense of belonging and community, while also potentially shielding one from mistakes that others have made. For example, a friend's advice on managing finances, gained from their own experiences, can help avoid costly errors, while lessons from family members on relationships can aid in navigating social complexities more effectively.On the other hand, personal experience breeds resilience and promotes a deeper understanding of life. The knowledge gained from direct experiences is often more profound, as the emotions, challenges, and successes encountered create lasting memories and personal growth. This approach enables individuals to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills as they navigate various life situations independently. Overcoming adversity or achieving success through one's own efforts can lead to a sense of empowerment and confidence that external guidance may not provide.Ultimately, the most effective method may be a combination of both approaches, rather than a strict preference for one over the other. While the insights of family and friends can provide valuable guidance, personal experience allows individuals to navigate life's path with authenticity and self-awareness. It is believed that learning about life is most effectively achieved when one seeks the wisdom of others while also embracing their unique journey. By balancing these approaches, one can broaden their perspective and enrich their understanding of what it means to lead a fulfilling life.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;"The notion that childhood is the most joyful period in a person's life is a subjective assertion that, although widely accepted, can be disputed from multiple angles. The idea that childhood is typically marked by happiness and innocence has some validity, but it neglects the complexity and variability of individual experiences and the potential for happiness that exists in other life stages.The primary argument for considering childhood as the happiest phase of life is based on the freedom, imagination, and lack of adult responsibilities that characterize this period. Children are generally free to explore their world without the burdens that come with adulthood, engaging in play, discovery, and creativity, and viewing the world with an unjaded sense of wonder. Additionally, the nurturing relationships formed with family and friends provide a sense of security and unconditional love, further contributing to their happiness.However, this romanticized view of childhood overlooks the difficulties faced by many children. Problems like bullying, dysfunctional family environments, poverty, and mental health issues can significantly diminish the joy associated with childhood. For many individuals, these challenges can overshadow the happy moments, leading to long-lasting impacts that may extend into adulthood.Furthermore, happiness does not come to an end with the transition to adulthood; instead, it evolves. Adults often derive fulfillment from achievements, relationships, and personal development. The satisfaction of building a career, raising a family, or fostering deep friendships can offer a sense of purpose that may exceed the straightforward pleasures of childhood.In summary, while childhood can indeed be a period of joy characterized by innocence and exploration, it is overly simplistic to claim it as the happiest time of life universally. Happiness is a multifaceted and dynamic concept that continues to evolve with our experiences, relationships, and personal growth across every stage of life. Thus, it is essential to acknowledge that each phase of life has the potential to be filled with happiness, albeit in unique and diverse ways."
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;The introduction of modern conveniences in food preparation has had a profound impact on our lives, largely for the better. As our daily routines become increasingly busy, the simplicity of food preparation can substantially reduce stress, save time, and improve our overall quality of life.Firstly, the widespread availability of processed foods and ready-to-cook meals has radically changed the way we cook. For individuals with busy schedules, such as working parents and students, the ability to rapidly prepare a meal enables them to maintain a balanced diet despite their time limitations. Pre-chopped vegetables and frozen meals, for example, can be prepared in mere minutes, allowing people to devote less time to cooking and more time to activities that bring them joy and fulfillment, such as spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, or practicing self-care.Furthermore, technological advancements have been instrumental in streamlining food preparation. The emergence of appliances like air fryers, pressure cookers, and slow cookers provides efficient cooking methods, allowing individuals to enjoy healthy meals without the burden of lengthy preparation. A slow cooker, for instance, can transform tough cuts of meat and simple vegetables into nutritious stews with just a few hours of unattended cooking, not only providing sustenance but also fostering a sense of pride and delight in home-cooked meals.Moreover, the accessibility of online recipes and cooking tutorials has made culinary skills more accessible, enabling anyone to explore diverse cuisines and cooking techniques. This encourages creativity in meal planning and can become a calming and enjoyable hobby, ultimately leading to a more positive relationship with food.In summary, the ease of food preparation in today's world has greatly enhanced the way people live. By facilitating quicker meal preparation, promoting efficiency through technology, and encouraging culinary exploration, these advancements have allowed many to lead healthier, more balanced lives, enriching both their physical and emotional well-being.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;The period of transition from adolescence to adulthood is a pivotal stage in life, often marked by differing perspectives on living arrangements. Some young adults strive to achieve independence from their parents as quickly as possible, while others prefer the security and comfort of living with their family. In my view, attaining independence at a young age is essential for fostering personal growth, responsibility, and resilience, thereby equipping young adults with the necessary tools to tackle future challenges.Primarily, independence provides young adults with the opportunity to develop vital life skills. By living on their own, they are forced to manage daily tasks such as preparing meals, creating budgets, and maintaining their households. For example, a young adult who is responsible for paying rent must learn to balance their finances, plan their meals, and keep their living space clean and organized. These practical experiences contribute to a sense of self-sufficiency, which is crucial for success in adulthood. Furthermore, the experience gained from managing a household prepares individuals for future challenges, whether in their personal or professional lives.Moreover, living independently allows young adults to explore their identities and make decisions that reflect their personal values and beliefs. In an independent living situation, they have the freedom to experiment with different lifestyles, which can contribute to building confidence and facilitating self-discovery. For instance, a young adult may discover a passion for a particular hobby or career without the influence of their parents, allowing them to gain a clearer understanding of their desires and aspirations.On the other hand, living with parents can provide emotional support and stability, which can be beneficial in certain circumstances, such as during significant life transitions like attending college or starting a new job. However, over-reliance on parental guidance can hinder personal growth and the development of essential coping skills needed to navigate the challenges of adulthood.In conclusion, while both living independently and living with parents have their advantages, I firmly believe that attaining independence at a young age offers young adults the best opportunity to develop essential life skills, foster self-discovery, and prepare for future responsibilities. Embracing this transition can ultimately lead to a more confident, accomplished, and successful adult life.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;The notion that zoos are devoid of purpose is a disputed claim, and although some people may contest the relevance of zoos in today's society, I strongly disagree. Zoos fulfill multiple vital roles, including education, conservation, scientific research, and recreation, making them essential to the way society interacts with wildlife.One of the primary functions of zoos is education. By offering a chance for people to observe and learn about animals up close, zoos cultivate a strong bond between the public and wildlife. Programs designed for both children and adults raise awareness about ecological issues, the significance of biodiversity, and the necessity of conservation efforts. For example, interactive exhibits and presentations enable visitors to learn about the natural habitats and behaviors of animals, fostering empathy and a desire to protect them in their natural environments.In addition to their educational value, zoos make significant contributions to conservation. With many species facing endangerment due to habitat destruction, poaching, and climate change, zoos help alleviate some of this pressure by participating in breeding programs for threatened species, maintaining genetic diversity, and conducting research to improve the chances of survival for these animals. The success of initiatives such as the California condor recovery program demonstrates how well-managed breeding in captivity can facilitate the reintroduction of species into their natural habitats.Furthermore, zoos function as invaluable research centers for scientists and veterinarians. They provide an accessible setting for studying animal behavior, health, and reproductive biology, which enhances our understanding of wildlife and contributes to the development of better management practices for animals in both captivity and the wild.In conclusion, while it is crucial to acknowledge the ethical considerations surrounding zoos, they undoubtedly serve vital purposes in education, conservation, and research. Rather than being outdated, zoos are indispensable in fostering a deeper understanding of wildlife and supporting efforts to preserve the planet's natural heritage.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;I strongly support the notion that parents are the most effective educators for young children, as their impact on a child's early development is unparalleled. The role of parents in shaping a child's foundational skills, values, and understanding is crucial, as these elements form the basis of their future growth and development.Initially, parents are responsible for providing the first and most fundamental form of education. From birth, children begin learning through observing, imitating, and interacting with their parents. The home environment plays a vital role in nurturing essential life skills, such as motor skills, language development, and social interactions, which are often developed through play, conversations, and daily routines. This initial exposure not only facilitates educational development but also emotional growth, as parents offer the comfort and security that encourages children to explore and learn.Furthermore, parents are uniquely positioned to impart their values, ethics, and social norms to their children. Unlike traditional educational settings, which may not align with every family's beliefs or values, parents have the opportunity to teach their children what they deem important, right, and worthy of respect. This foundational understanding has a profound impact on a child's character and influences their decisions and actions throughout their lives.However, it is essential to recognize that while parents play a vital role in their children's early education, they are not the only educators. Other influential figures, such as professional teachers, caregivers, and the broader community, also contribute significantly to a child's learning experience, often bringing specialized knowledge and diverse perspectives that may not be available to parents.In conclusion, I firmly believe that parents are indeed the most significant educators for young children, as their influence during the formative years is profound and lasting. They equip children with the essential skills and values necessary to navigate life. Nevertheless, it is crucial to view parental teaching as complementary to, rather than a replacement for, the contributions made by other educators and the community at large.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;"The impact of television on young children has been a topic of debate since its inception, with some arguing that it has a negative influence. However, I believe that the issue lies not with the medium itself, but with the type of content and how it is consumed. Exposure to unsuitable content is a primary concern when it comes to children's television viewing. Many shows feature violence, offensive language, and negative stereotypes, which can have a distorting effect on young minds, leading to increased aggression and desensitization to violence. Moreover, excessive television watching can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in health problems like obesity. Without proper parental oversight and guidelines, television can have detrimental effects on children.On the other hand, television also has the potential to be a valuable educational tool. Educational shows, documentaries, and well-made children's programs can spark curiosity, improve vocabulary, and introduce kids to diverse cultures and ideas. For example, shows like ""Sesame Street"" and ""Blue Planet"" are both entertaining and educational, teaching children about maths, language skills, and environmental awareness. The rise of streaming services has also made it easier for parents to choose content that aligns with their values and educational goals.In conclusion, while television can have a negative impact on children when consumed without discretion, it also has the potential for positive influence when used thoughtfully. The key to this is parental guidance, careful content selection, and creating an environment where children engage with educational and enriching programs. By taking an active role in children's media consumption, parents can help their kids navigate the complexities of television in a way that supports healthy development."
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;The concept of hiring employees for life is a notion that warrants scrutiny. Although the traditional idea of lifelong employment may convey a sense of stability and dedication, I argue that it is no longer suitable for the modern job market. A more adaptable employment model is better suited to the ever-changing needs of both employees and employers in today's dynamic work environment.There are several reasons why lifelong employment is no longer viable. Firstly, the rapid pace of technological advancements demands that businesses be agile and responsive to stay competitive. As industries evolve, the necessary skills to succeed also change. Long-term employment can hinder this adaptability, as employees may become complacent in their roles and resistant to acquiring new skills. For example, the information technology and renewable energy sectors are constantly transforming, requiring employees who are willing to learn and adapt. Hiring employees for life can stifle innovation and limit the influx of fresh ideas that new employees can bring, ultimately detracting from a company's long-term success.Secondly, employees often strive for personal growth and career development. Many individuals experience changes in interests or life circumstances that prompt them to seek new opportunities. A lifelong job can lead to dissatisfaction if an employee feels unfulfilled or unchallenged. Moreover, companies benefit from a diverse workforce that includes new perspectives, experiences, and ideas. Hiring employees on a shorter-term basis allows for a rotation of talent that can revitalize a company's culture and drive innovation.Lastly, the modern workforce prioritizes work-life balance and flexibility. The growth of remote work and gig economies reflects a new reality in which employees prioritize autonomy over job security. Companies that embrace this trend can attract top talent who are increasingly looking for opportunities that align with their personal and professional goals.In conclusion, although the idea of lifelong employment may seem appealing, the realities of a rapidly changing business environment suggest that a more flexible and adaptive approach to hiring is necessary. Businesses should focus on fostering continuous learning and providing opportunities for growth, ultimately benefiting both employees and organizations. By adopting a more dynamic employment model, companies can stay competitive, drive innovation, and attract top talent in today's fast-paced job market.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";The notion that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life is a sentiment that resonates deeply with me. The unbridled joy, freedom from worry, and innocence of youth converge to create an environment that is conducive to happiness. Several aspects of childhood contribute to its unique capacity for joy.One notable aspect is the ability of children to find delight in everyday experiences. Their enthusiasm is contagious, whether they're playing outdoors, discovering new games, or simply enjoying the thrill of running through the rain. Reflecting on my own childhood, I'm reminded of how a simple outing to the park with friends could effortlessly transform into an unforgettable adventure, replete with laughter and creativity. Unfortunately, as we grow older, the weight of adult responsibilities often overshadows these carefree moments, diminishing our capacity to derive joy from the simple things.Another characteristic of childhood is the absence of significant responsibilities. Unencumbered by the pressures of employment, financial obligations, and complex social expectations, children are free to explore and discover themselves without the burden of adult pressures. I recall numerous summer days spent exploring nearby woods, with the sole concern being to return home in time for dinner. Such moments of unadulterated freedom foster a profound sense of happiness that is seldom replicated in later life.Furthermore, childhood is a time when enduring bonds with family and friends are formed, giving rise to lasting memories of love and connection. The affection and support received during these years lay the groundwork for emotional well-being. Celebrations such as birthdays, holidays, and family gatherings during childhood are often imbued with love and joy, reinforcing the idea that these early years are particularly replete with happiness.In summary, while each stage of life has its unique joys and challenges, childhood undoubtedly occupies a special place as the happiest time. The amalgam of innocence, freedom, and emotional connections during this period culminates in a reservoir of joy that is frequently unmatched in subsequent years.
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";The idea that studying the past has no relevance to our current lives and future decisions is a misguided perspective that neglects the significant influence of history on our present and future. I strongly disagree with this viewpoint, and for good reason.Firstly, history offers valuable insights that can inform our decision-making in the present. By examining past errors, such as wars fueled by nationalism or the economic downturn of the Great Depression, we can learn from the consequences of our actions. This knowledge enables societies to develop policies that prevent similar mistakes from recurring. For example, the aftermath of World War II had a profound impact on modern international relations, prompting nations to prioritize diplomacy and cooperation, which in turn led to a decline in conflicts.Moreover, understanding history helps shape our sense of identity and continuity. Our present is deeply rooted in the legacies of our predecessors. Cultural traditions, social norms, and political systems have evolved over time, reflecting the imprint of historical events. The civil rights movements of the 20th century, for instance, continue to inform contemporary discussions about equality and justice, serving as a reminder that the struggle for human rights is an ongoing endeavor that demands vigilance and engagement. Without an appreciation for these historical contexts, individuals may lack a comprehensive understanding of their roles and responsibilities within society.Furthermore, engaging with history cultivates critical thinking skills. Analyzing historical events requires the evaluation of sources, consideration of multiple perspectives, and the ability to think critically. These skills are essential in today's world, where misinformation can spread quickly. By learning how to assess historical narratives, individuals are better equipped to navigate complex contemporary issues, such as climate change, global pandemics, and social inequality.In conclusion, dismissing the value of learning from the past is a serious error. History informs our choices, shapes our identities, and enhances our critical thinking abilities. Embracing the lessons of the past enriches our understanding of the present and prepares us for a more informed and conscientious future. By recognizing the significance of history, we can make more informed decisions, foster a deeper sense of identity and continuity, and develop the critical thinking skills necessary to navigate the complexities of the modern world.
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;For centuries, humanity has been fascinated by the exploration of outer space, prompting governments worldwide to dedicate substantial resources to various space missions. Although some critics contend that the funds allocated to space travel could be more effectively utilized to address pressing issues on our planet, I firmly believe that such investments are not only justified but also vital for the future of our species.The primary reason for this is that space exploration is a key driver of technological innovation. The complexities and challenges of space travel necessitate the development of novel solutions, leading to the creation of state-of-the-art technologies that frequently have applications in our daily lives. Examples of this include advancements in materials science, telecommunications, and medical technology, all of which have been derived from research undertaken for space exploration. These technological breakthroughs contribute significantly to economic expansion and enhance the quality of life on Earth.In addition to driving technological progress, space exploration serves essential scientific purposes. Gaining insight into phenomena such as climate change, planetary geology, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life is heavily reliant on data gathered from space missions. This knowledge plays a critical role in addressing key global challenges, including environmental sustainability and resource management. By investing in space exploration, governments are also investing in our capacity to comprehend, predict, and potentially mitigate the impacts of global crises.Moreover, the pursuit of resources and habitats beyond Earth may become increasingly crucial as our planet's resources diminish. Investing in space travel not only lays the groundwork for the potential colonization of other planets but also presents opportunities for resource extraction, such as asteroid mining. This could help alleviate some of the pressures currently faced by our planet's overburdened natural resources.In conclusion, while the expenses associated with space exploration may appear considerable, the benefits garnered in terms of technological innovation, scientific understanding, and potential resources render it a reasonable and necessary investment. As we progress, the exploration of outer space may prove to be a pivotal factor in ensuring a sustainable future for humanity.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";"The claim that television is responsible for the decline of communication among friends and family is a contentious topic that warrants discussion. Although it is undeniable that television has had a significant impact on the way people interact with each other, I only partially agree with this assertion. Instead of eroding communication, television has, in many cases, revolutionized and even improved it.One of the primary advantages of television is its ability to provide a shared topic of conversation among family members and friends. For example, a popular TV show can spark discussions, debates, and communal experiences. Families who watch the same programs often bond over their favorite characters or plot developments, fostering relationships that may not have formed without a shared interest. A prime illustration of this phenomenon is shows like ""Game of Thrones"" or ""Stranger Things,"" which have captivated audiences and become subjects of discussion, thereby enriching interpersonal dynamics.Furthermore, the rise of streaming services has made global content accessible to a broader audience, enabling families and friends to explore diverse cultures and ideas together. This exposure can lead to meaningful conversations about societal issues, human experiences, or moral dilemmas presented in these shows, resulting in deeper understanding and empathy among viewers. In this context, television serves not only as a source of entertainment but also as a catalyst for dialogue and introspection.However, it is essential to acknowledge that excessive television consumption can lead to social disengagement. When individuals spend too much time watching screens, it can detract from face-to-face interactions. Finding a balance is crucial; moderate screen time can facilitate effective communication while still allowing viewers to enjoy the benefits of television.In conclusion, while television presents challenges to traditional communication patterns, it also offers opportunities for connection and dialogue. Rather than viewing it as a destructive force, it should be seen as a complex influence on the ways friends and family interact with each other. By recognizing both the positive and negative effects of television, we can harness its potential to enhance communication and foster meaningful relationships."
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;In the intricate world of friendships, the choice to let a friend make a mistake, rather than stepping in to prevent it, is often a delicate balancing act between emotional risks and personal development. I strongly support the idea that giving a friend the space to make mistakes is preferable to intervening in a way that could potentially harm the friendship.Primarily, permitting friends to make errors enables them to learn and grow as individuals. Mistakes are an inevitable part of life, and they often provide the most valuable learning experiences. For example, I recall a close friend who once decided to invest in a questionable business venture. Although I had the opportunity to warn him and prevent the mistake, I chose to let him navigate the situation on his own. When the investment ultimately failed, my friend gained invaluable insights into the importance of thorough research and prudent financial decisions, rather than damaging our friendship. By confronting the consequences of his actions, he became more cautious and informed in his subsequent decisions.Furthermore, excessive intervention can lead to feelings of resentment or unease in a friendship. Friendships flourish on the basis of mutual respect and trust. If one friend feels overly controlled or judged, it can create tension and potentially harm the relationship. To illustrate this point, consider the experience of another friend who faced criticism for her choice of romantic partner. After reflecting on her situation and experiencing the natural consequences, she eventually made an informed decision about the relationship, and our friendship remained intact. Had I pressured her to end the relationship, it could have created an uncomfortable dynamic in our interactions.Ultimately, while it can be challenging to watch friends make mistakes, these experiences are essential for their growth and development. By giving friends the autonomy to make mistakes and learn from them, we reinforce their independence and strengthen our bonds, ultimately leading to more profound and resilient friendships.
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;One of the most efficient methods for parents to prepare their teenage children for adulthood is to motivate them to secure a part-time job. Working during adolescence offers numerous benefits, including the opportunity to earn a personal income and develop essential life skills that will serve them well in the future.Primarily, a part-time job fosters a sense of responsibility in teenagers. By balancing work with academic obligations, they acquire effective time management skills, learning to prioritize tasks, manage their schedules, and meet deadlines - all of which are crucial in adulthood. This experience lays the groundwork for improved time management strategies when they eventually enter university or the full-time workforce.Furthermore, part-time employment exposes teenagers to real-world settings, enabling them to refine their interpersonal skills. Interactions with colleagues, supervisors, and clients facilitate the development of their communication skills and teach them the value of teamwork. These experiences enhance their collaborative work abilities and increase their adaptability and resilience in the face of challenges.Moreover, a part-time job promotes financial awareness among teenagers. By earning their own income, they gain practical experience in budgeting, saving, and wise spending. This hands-on experience helps them understand the value of money and develop a sense of financial responsibility, which is vital when they eventually manage their own finances as adults.Lastly, engaging in part-time work can facilitate career exploration for teenagers. Exposure to diverse job roles and industries allows them to discover their passions and interests, ultimately guiding their future educational and career choices. This self-awareness enables them to pursue paths that align with their aspirations.In summary, encouraging teenagers to take on part-time jobs provides them with vital life skills, enhances their financial literacy, and supports their career development. By supporting this opportunity, parents can significantly contribute to preparing their children for the complexities of adult life.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;Raising a child in a rural setting has numerous benefits that can have a profound impact on their development, making it a more desirable environment than the fast-paced and overwhelming atmosphere of a large city. While cities offer advantages such as access to educational institutions and cultural diversity, the countryside provides a range of comprehensive benefits that promote a child's overall growth and well-being.One of the primary advantages of growing up in the countryside is the opportunity to connect with nature. Children in rural areas often develop a deep appreciation for the environment through outdoor activities like hiking, farming, and exploring local wildlife, which fosters creativity, curiosity, and a sense of adventure. Research has demonstrated that spending time in natural settings can improve concentration, reduce stress, and promote healthy emotional development. In contrast, urban children are often exposed to pollution, congestion, and other environmental stressors that can negatively impact their well-being.Furthermore, the rural lifestyle tends to promote strong community bonds and social connections. Children who grow up in the countryside often form close relationships with their neighbors and family members, which instills important values like cooperation, empathy, and mutual respect. This sense of community is essential for healthy social development, as it allows children to develop essential life skills like communication, conflict resolution, and teamwork. In contrast, urban children may feel isolated and disconnected from their community, despite being surrounded by people, due to the competitive and fast-paced nature of city life. This can lead to increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression, which are less common in smaller, close-knit rural communities.Another significant advantage of growing up in the countryside is the increased safety and security. Lower crime rates, reduced traffic hazards, and a more relaxed pace of life provide children with the freedom to explore, play, and engage in outdoor activities independently, which fosters autonomy, confidence, and self-reliance. These traits are essential for healthy development, as they allow children to develop problem-solving skills, take calculated risks, and learn from their mistakes.In conclusion, while city living has its advantages, the countryside offers a unique and ideal environment for children to grow and develop. The combination of a natural and nurturing environment, strong community bonds, and increased safety provides children with the perfect backdrop to develop emotionally, socially, and physically. For these reasons, I firmly believe that growing up in the countryside is more beneficial for children than growing up in a large and bustling city.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;The notion that parents are the best teachers is a complex issue that deserves thorough examination, as it involves various viewpoints on education and learning. Although I recognize the significant role parents play in imparting vital life lessons and values, I disagree that they are the best teachers. This is because learning is a multifaceted process that goes beyond the family setting.The primary reason for this is that education extends far beyond the home. Trained educators are equipped to provide a comprehensive curriculum and employ a range of teaching methods that cater to different learning styles. For example, a skilled teacher can use multimedia resources, group discussions, and hands-on activities to engage students in ways that parents, without formal training, may not be able to replicate. Furthermore, teachers offer access to a broad range of knowledge across multiple subjects, introducing students to concepts that may not naturally arise in a home setting.Moreover, the social aspect of education is crucial and cannot be overlooked. Schools are miniature versions of the larger world, where children learn essential social skills like teamwork, empathy, and communication through interactions with peers and authority figures outside their family. A child who primarily learns from their parents may lack opportunities to develop these vital interpersonal skills, which are necessary for success in both personal and professional life.That being said, it is undeniable that parents have a crucial role in shaping their children's character and values. As the first educators, they instill fundamental morals and guide their children through the early challenges of life. For instance, parents teach their children the importance of honesty, respect, and other core values that serve as the foundation for further education.In conclusion, while parents undoubtedly teach invaluable life lessons, the importance of formal education and the experiences gained through social interactions make professional teachers essential to a child's overall development. The most effective education is a collaborative effort that combines the wisdom of parents with the expertise of educators, ultimately providing a well-rounded education.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;"The way people prepare food has undergone a significant transformation, greatly impacting daily life and making it more convenient for many individuals. This shift has brought about numerous benefits, enhancing not only the efficiency of cooking but also the overall quality of life for people from diverse backgrounds.The integration of technology in the kitchen has been a key driver of this change, simplifying cooking processes. Appliances such as microwaves, food processors, and instant pots have made meal preparation faster, reducing cooking time. For example, a working parent can now quickly prepare a healthy meal in under 30 minutes, a task that would have taken hours in the past. This increased efficiency aligns with the fast pace of modern life and allows families to spend more time together, strengthening their bonds.Beyond convenience, easier meal preparation has also led to healthier eating habits. The availability of pre-prepared and portioned ingredients has encouraged individuals to cook at home rather than opting for fast food or takeout. This trend promotes healthier eating choices, as home-cooked meals are often more nutritious and can be tailored to specific dietary requirements. For instance, someone trying to manage their weight can prepare meals using fresh vegetables and lean proteins, avoiding high-calorie takeout options.Furthermore, the cultural significance of food preparation has not diminished with these changes; rather, it has evolved. The proliferation of online resources, including cooking blogs, YouTube channels, and meal preparation apps, has made learning about different cuisines more accessible. Even those with no prior cooking experience can now learn to prepare a variety of flavorful dishes from around the world in the comfort of their own kitchens.In conclusion, advancements in food preparation methods have undoubtedly enhanced the way people live. By making cooking more accessible and promoting healthier eating habits, these changes have had a positive impact on both individual well-being and social relationships. Therefore, the ease of food preparation today represents a significant improvement in modern lifestyles, offering numerous benefits that enhance the quality of life for individuals from all walks of life."
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The relevance and importance of regular standardized testing in modern education is a highly debated and timely topic. Advocates for standardized testing claim that these evaluations are essential in determining whether students have a thorough understanding of the material being taught. By administering regular standardized tests, educational institutions can establish a consistent and reliable measure of student learning and accountability.The primary advantage of standardized testing is that it provides a structured framework for assessing student progress over time. These evaluations are designed to measure knowledge across various subjects and grade levels, enabling educators to identify knowledge gaps, pinpoint areas that require extra attention, and monitor overall learning progress. Additionally, regular testing can foster a sense of responsibility and dedication among students, encouraging them to consistently engage with the curriculum, develop effective study habits, and acquire essential learning strategies that promote lifelong educational success.Furthermore, standardized tests serve as a means of accountability for students, educators, and school systems alike. By evaluating the effectiveness of teaching methods and curricula, educational authorities can make informed decisions about resource allocation and necessary educational reforms. This accountability drives both students and teachers to strive for educational excellence.Although critics of standardized testing often express concerns about the potential for stress and its negative impact on student wellbeing, thoughtful implementation of these assessments can minimize anxiety. Strategies such as incorporating practice tests, providing sufficient preparation resources, and designing tests that cater to diverse student abilities can lead to a more positive and productive testing experience.In conclusion, the implementation of regular standardized testing has the potential to improve educational outcomes. By providing a standard for evaluating both student learning and teaching effectiveness, standardized tests can facilitate continuous improvement in the educational landscape, ultimately contributing to the overarching goal of achieving academic mastery and success.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";The issue of whether higher education should be free for all prospective students is a topic of considerable discussion. I strongly support the notion that university education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of financial means, as it promotes equality, fosters personal and societal advancement, and tackles the pressing issue of skill shortages in the workforce.Firstly, offering free university education is inherently egalitarian. Financial constraints often prevent talented students from pursuing higher education, resulting in a loss of potential and diverse perspectives. By making education affordable, students from different socioeconomic backgrounds can access the same quality of education, contributing to a more just society. This approach enables individuals to reach their full potential based on merit, rather than their financial situation.Furthermore, free university education can greatly contribute to personal and societal progress. Without the burden of tuition fees, students are more likely to pursue fields that align with their passions and abilities, rather than those that offer immediate financial gains. This freedom encourages innovation and creativity, fostering a more educated and skilled population that can navigate complex global challenges. Moreover, a well-educated workforce is crucial for economic growth, as countries with higher education levels tend to experience increased productivity and innovation.Additionally, providing free university education helps address the skill shortages faced by many industries. As technology advances, there is a growing need for professionals with specialized knowledge and skills. By removing financial obstacles, we can encourage more students to pursue critical fields such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). A skilled workforce can drive economic progress and ensure that communities can adapt to evolving job markets.In conclusion, university education should indeed be provided free of charge to all interested students. This policy would not only create equal opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds but also stimulate personal growth, economic development, and social equality, making it a crucial step towards a more prosperous and equitable society.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;The debate surrounding the role of university professors has been ongoing, with a particular focus on the balance between research and teaching responsibilities. In my opinion, the primary focus of professors should be on educating students, although research is also a vital aspect of their job.The core mission of a university is to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary for their future careers, making education the foundation upon which academic institutions are built. When professors allocate sufficient time to teaching, they create a stimulating learning environment that encourages critical thinking, intellectual curiosity, and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. By providing individualized attention to students, professors can help them better comprehend complex concepts. Moreover, professors who are invested in their students' education have the power to inspire and transform lives, extending beyond the academic sphere.While research is undoubtedly crucial in academia, as it fuels innovation and boosts a university's reputation, which in turn attracts funding and distinguished faculty, an overemphasis on research can lead to a detachment between professors and students. If professors are overly engrossed in their research, they may not be as accessible to offer the support and mentorship that students require. This imbalance can have a negative impact on the learning experience of students, who greatly benefit from engaging with faculty members who are committed to teaching.The optimal situation is one where research and teaching are balanced in harmony. Professors should engage in research, but not at the cost of their fundamental role as educators. By integrating their research findings into the curriculum, professors can offer students cutting-edge knowledge, making the learning experience both pertinent and impactful. In summary, while research is significant, the priority should always be on nurturing and educating students, as they will be the future innovators and leaders of our society.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;"The media, including television and movies, has a profound impact on people's behavior, influencing societal norms and individual actions in multiple ways. This influence can be understood through three key mechanisms: imitation, desensitization, and altered perceptions of reality.Many people imitate the behaviors of characters they admire, a phenomenon known as social learning theory. For instance, research has shown that watching superheroes on TV can encourage children to exhibit pro-social behaviors, such as sharing and helping others. On the other hand, exposure to violent content can increase aggressive behaviors, as seen in the ""copycat"" effect where viewers mimic violent acts depicted on screen.Additionally, repeated exposure to certain themes can lead to desensitization, causing individuals to become less responsive to violence, moral dilemmas, or other issues portrayed in the media. For example, regular viewers of action movies may start to see violence as a normal way to resolve conflicts, influencing their approach to real-life disputes. This desensitization can decrease empathy and increase the acceptance of violent solutions to problems like crime.Furthermore, the media shapes our understanding of reality by presenting distorted or exaggerated narratives. Reality TV shows, for example, often depict unrealistic lifestyles and relationships, leading viewers to adopt misguided ideals about wealth, beauty, and success. This can drive consumerist behaviors, where individuals feel pressured to emulate the extravagant lifestyles they see on screen.In summary, television and movies significantly influence behavior through imitation, desensitization, and shaping perceptions of reality. As the media continues to evolve, it is crucial for viewers to critically evaluate the content they consume, mitigating potentially harmful effects on their behavior and societal norms."
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;When exploring new destinations, many travelers prioritize visiting museums, driven by a range of compelling motivations. These include a desire to gain insight into local culture and history, to immerse themselves in art and creativity, and to forge connections with the community.Museums play a pivotal role in facilitating an understanding of a location's history and cultural heritage. By housing a plethora of artifacts and exhibits, they narrate the story of a place, its inhabitants, and its transformation over time. For example, a visit to the British Museum in London offers the chance to discover ancient Egyptian relics and Greek sculptures, providing profound insights into the civilizations that have shaped our world. Through the examination of these historical artifacts, travelers acquire not only knowledge but also a deeper appreciation for the cultural context of their surroundings.Moreover, museums are treasure troves of artistic expression, providing a platform for creativity to flourish. Art aficionados flock to galleries and museums to experience the masterpieces of celebrated artists in person, an experience that far surpasses viewing images online or in print. The Louvre in Paris, for instance, allows visitors to stand in awe before iconic works like the Mona Lisa or the Venus de Milo, fostering a profound and visceral connection to the art that transcends mere observation. This engagement with art has the power to inspire, provoke thought, and enrich the travel experience.Finally, museum visits foster a sense of community and connection with the local populace. Many museums host a variety of events, including lectures and workshops, that encourage interaction and dialogue. Engaging with locals in these settings provides travelers with unique viewpoints and insights, thereby enhancing their cultural understanding. Community-oriented museums in smaller towns, for example, may feature local talent or historians, allowing visitors to engage with the essence and spirit of the community.In summary, museums are indispensable stops for travelers, offering unparalleled opportunities to delve into history, appreciate art, and forge connections with local culture, thereby rendering each visit an unforgettable component of the journey.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"In today's fast-paced and crowded society, the demands of daily life can sometimes lead to neglect of basic social etiquette, causing some individuals to assume that expecting courtesy from others is unrealistic. I, however, strongly argue against this viewpoint. Being polite is not just a nicety; it's a vital component of human interaction that promotes harmony, maintains respectful relationships, and fosters a sense of community, even in the midst of modern life's chaos.The primary importance of politeness lies in its ability to facilitate smooth communication. Even in challenging situations, such as densely populated public transport or busy urban settings, a simple act of courtesy like expressing gratitude or saying please can greatly improve the atmosphere and encourage cooperation. When we exhibit polite behavior, we acknowledge the shared humanity that binds us together, creating a sense of belonging that is essential in today's often impersonal world.Furthermore, anticipating courtesy from others promotes a culture that values empathy and respect. When we prioritize kindness, even in brief interactions, it creates a positive impact that can inspire others to emulate the same behavior. This is particularly significant in high-stress environments where a polite demeanor can greatly alleviate tension. By upholding courtesy standards, we enhance our personal interactions and contribute to a more harmonious and compassionate society.It's also crucial to understand that expecting politeness doesn't ignore the realities of modern life. Although people might be stressed or preoccupied, acknowledging these circumstances should motivate us to act with increased empathy and understanding. Recognizing human imperfections shouldn't be an excuse to abandon kindness; rather, it should encourage us to strive for compassion and consideration.In conclusion, instead of giving up on expecting politeness in an increasingly crowded world, we should cling to this principle. It enhances our interactions, promotes respect, and ultimately contributes to a more empathetic society that functions smoothly amidst daily challenges."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;I wholeheartedly endorse the idea that the majority of life's experiences, despite appearing daunting at the time, eventually transform into invaluable lessons for the future. Life is filled with obstacles that put our resilience, adaptability, and comprehension to the test. Although these moments can be uncomfortable or even painful, they frequently serve as pivotal turning points that facilitate personal growth and development.A compelling argument in support of this notion is that difficult experiences inherently offer opportunities for introspection and self-discovery. For example, consider the experience of failing an examination. Initially, this failure may seem devastating, leading to feelings of disappointment and self-doubt. Nevertheless, upon reflection, such an experience could motivate the individual to reassess their study habits, seek assistance from peers or tutors, and ultimately develop a more profound understanding of the subject matter. This novel approach not only enhances academic performance but also fosters a growth mindset, enabling the individual to confront future challenges with increased confidence.Furthermore, overcoming adversity often cultivates resilience, an essential trait required in both personal and professional realms. For instance, an individual who faces job loss may initially perceive it as a disastrous setback. Yet, this experience may lead them to explore novel career paths, acquire additional qualifications, or even establish their own business. The challenges encountered during unemployment can instill a stronger sense of determination and adaptability that proves invaluable in future pursuits.Lastly, many of life's most challenging moments enrich our empathy and understanding of others. When we encounter struggles, we become more attuned to the difficulties of those surrounding us. As a result, we evolve into more compassionate individuals, capable of offering support and guidance to others in need.In conclusion, challenging experiences, although often disheartening at the moment, ultimately evolve into valuable life lessons. They cultivate self-awareness, resilience, and empathy, molding us into stronger individuals equipped to navigate the complexities of life.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;The urban lifestyle is often regarded as superior to rural life due to several key advantages. Primarily, cities function as thriving economic centers, providing a wide range of job opportunities across various sectors such as technology, finance, healthcare, and entertainment. In contrast to the limited job options in rural areas, which are often restricted to agriculture or small-scale businesses, cities offer diverse industries that attract individuals looking for career progression and a more affluent lifestyle.Additionally, urban areas are culturally diverse, offering residents a broad spectrum of entertainment, dining, and leisure activities. The abundance of theaters, museums, concert venues, restaurants, and vibrant nightlife in cities caters to a wide range of tastes and preferences, fostering a sense of community among residents from different backgrounds. This cultural diversity enriches the social aspect of urban life as people come together to share experiences and ideas.Cities also have the upper hand when it comes to access to healthcare and education. They are home to prestigious hospitals, specialized clinics, and numerous educational institutions, including universities and colleges. This ensures that residents have access to superior healthcare services and educational opportunities, which are crucial for personal and professional growth.Moreover, urban areas typically boast well-developed public infrastructure. Efficient public transportation systems, such as buses and trains, provide an affordable and convenient means of travel, reducing the need for personal vehicles and subsequently minimizing traffic congestion and environmental pollution. This is in stark contrast to the limited public transportation options and increased reliance on cars that are common in rural areas.Although rural life offers peace and natural beauty, the dynamic and diverse environment of city life, with its numerous resources and opportunities, presents significant advantages that enhance personal and professional development. For those seeking career opportunities, cultural experiences, and convenience, city living is undoubtedly the preferred choice.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;The relationship between one's profession and living situation has a profound impact on overall happiness, but I firmly believe that a person's job has a more significant influence on their well-being. A job provides not only financial security, but also plays a crucial role in shaping one's identity, social connections, and personal fulfillment.The primary reason for this is that employment is often the main source of income, enabling individuals to afford essential resources like housing, food, and healthcare. Even the most desirable living environment can become a source of stress and anxiety without financial stability. For example, people with unfulfilling jobs in unattractive locations often find comfort in their earnings, which they use to create a comfortable life at home. On the other hand, financial instability in one's living situation can overshadow any positive aspects of their surroundings.Furthermore, the type of work one does has a significant impact on personal satisfaction. Doing meaningful work can give individuals a sense of purpose and achievement. People who find their careers meaningful often report higher levels of happiness, regardless of their living environment. For instance, healthcare professionals find joy and fulfillment in helping others, which can offset any dissatisfaction they may feel about their physical surroundings. This sense of accomplishment and belonging often leads to a more positive outlook on life.Additionally, the workplace is a key setting for social interactions. Positive relationships with colleagues can greatly enhance happiness. Supportive work environments foster collaboration, friendship, and a sense of community, which can increase job satisfaction and emotional well-being. In contrast, an unfulfilling living environment may lack social engagement, leaving individuals feeling isolated and alone, despite their material comforts.In conclusion, while both job and living environment contribute to happiness, a meaningful and fulfilling job ultimately has a greater impact. It determines our financial situation, gives us a sense of purpose, and provides opportunities for social connections, reinforcing the idea that our work is central to our overall happiness and contentment.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;The way people communicate has changed a lot in today's digital world, with many different ways for them to connect. Some people like using email and voicemail because it's easy and flexible, while others prefer traditional ways like phone calls or talking in person. I think talking in person is the best way to communicate because it allows for a stronger and more meaningful connection.One of the benefits of talking in person is that you can see non-verbal cues like body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice. These things help show how someone is feeling and what they mean, and they can't be replaced by written messages like emails. They also help make sure messages are clear, reduce misunderstandings, and make people feel more connected. For example, when you're having an important conversation or trying to work out a problem, being able to see how the other person is reacting can be really important for finding a solution.Talking in person also helps build stronger relationships. When people meet in person, they feel like they're part of a community and they trust each other, which is important in both personal and work relationships. Sharing experiences and laughing together in real time can make relationships stronger, and it's harder to do that with digital communication. Talking in person also makes people more likely to participate and be engaged, which leads to more interesting conversations.On the other hand, while emails and voicemails are convenient and give people time to think before responding, they often don't have the same immediacy and personal connection as talking in person. It's easier to misinterpret what someone means, and not being physically present can make it harder to build a relationship.In conclusion, while digital communication is useful in today's fast-paced world, I think talking in person is the best way to build strong relationships and understand each other better. That's why I prefer to communicate in person whenever I can.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";The notion that television erodes personal relationships and hinders communication among loved ones is a common criticism. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that this assertion is misguided. Although excessive TV viewing can undeniably hinder face-to-face interactions, I am convinced that television, when watched thoughtfully, can actually augment communication and strengthen bonds between family and friends.One of the primary ways in which television achieves this is by providing a shared experience that brings people together. Watching a show or movie collectively can trigger discussions, spark laughter, and create lasting memories. For example, a family may gather to watch a popular show or film that resonates with their interests, prompting debates about character choices and the sharing of personal perspectives. This, in turn, facilitates more in-depth conversations and strengthens relationships, rather than driving people apart.Furthermore, television has the power to educate and inform viewers on a wide range of subjects, thereby enabling more nuanced discussions. Documentary films, educational programs, and current events shows expose viewers to novel ideas and viewpoints, encouraging families and friends to engage in meaningful conversations about societal issues, culture, and science. This, in turn, fosters a more profound dialogue that enhances understanding and empathy amongst individuals.In addition, the evolution of television has been marked by its integration with social media platforms, which facilitate interaction amongst viewers. Many individuals utilize these platforms to discuss episodes in real-time, allowing friends to connect over shared interests, even when physical distance separates them. This interconnectedness has the potential to bridge geographical divides and maintain relationships.In conclusion, while I acknowledge that excessive television viewing can lead to a decline in communication, I firmly believe that television has the potential to enhance interactions amongst friends and family. By perceiving television as a catalyst for conversation and connection, rather than a barrier, we can appreciate its value in modern relationships.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;Effective communication is the foundation of human connection, influencing relationships, teamwork, and comprehension. The digital era has introduced various channels for expressing thoughts and emotions, including emails, voicemails, phone calls, and in-person meetings. Although each method has its strengths, I advocate for face-to-face interaction due to its numerous advantages.The primary benefit of face-to-face communication is the ability to form a deeper connection with others. Nonverbal signals, such as body language, facial expressions, and eye contact, significantly impact how messages are received and interpreted. For instance, a smile or a raised eyebrow can convey emotions that are frequently absent in written communication, like emails or voicemails. This multifaceted exchange of information cultivates empathy and understanding, resulting in a more refined and effective conversation.Another significant advantage of face-to-face communication is the reduced likelihood of misinterpretations. Written messages can sometimes lead to ambiguity or confusion, particularly when lacking the tone and inflection inherent in spoken conversations. By addressing questions and clarifying statements in real-time, both parties can ensure they share a mutual understanding. This is especially crucial in sensitive or intricate discussions, where clarity is essential.Additionally, face-to-face interactions frequently facilitate collaboration and creativity. In professional environments, in-person brainstorming sessions can stimulate a free flow of ideas that may be hindered in more isolated communication methods. The physical presence of others can inspire spontaneous and dynamic conversations, leading to innovative solutions that may not emerge through more structured digital exchanges.In summary, although emails and voicemails provide convenience and efficiency, I strongly believe that face-to-face communication offers unparalleled benefits. The capacity to connect emotionally, ensure clarity, and foster collaborative problem-solving solidifies face-to-face interaction as the pinnacle of communication, surpassing the limitations of digital channels.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;"The old saying ""haste makes waste"" holds a deep truth about how we make decisions and get work done. I strongly believe in this idea, as rushing to finish tasks often results in mistakes, inefficiencies, and missed chances to improve.The main problem with hurrying is that it usually leads to poor quality work. For instance, a student who rushes to finish a project might miss important details, leading to mistakes that could have been avoided with a more careful approach. These mistakes not only lead to lower grades, but also require extra time to fix, which means any time saved is lost. Similarly, in professional settings, making hasty decisions can lead to costly mistakes. A marketing team that rushes to launch a campaign without doing thorough research might create messages that don't resonate with their target audience, damaging the brand's credibility.Moreover, rushing can also mean missing out on chances to learn and grow. When we're in a hurry, we often skip important steps in solving problems, which can stifle creativity and limit innovative thinking. For example, a software developer who rushes to release a product might overlook potential improvements or features that could make the user experience better, resulting in a mediocre product that doesn't meet customer needs. Taking the time to think and reflect can lead to a more thoughtful and effective outcome.It's also important to consider the psychological impact of rushing. Constantly working under pressure can lead to stress and burnout, reducing overall productivity and motivation. People who take the time to prioritize tasks and manage their time well often find they're more satisfied with both the process and the end result.In conclusion, the wisdom of ""haste makes waste"" is clear. Rushing through tasks can lead to mistakes, hinder creativity, and contribute to stress. By giving ourselves time to think, reflect, and work carefully, we can produce better work and have a more fulfilling and productive experience."
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;The advent of the automobile has undoubtedly revolutionized modern life, bringing about unparalleled mobility and convenience. Nevertheless, this progress is offset by substantial drawbacks that warrant careful consideration. In my view, the benefits of automobiles are undeniable, but the problems they pose necessitate thoughtful examination.The primary advantage of automobiles lies in their ability to transform the way we travel and engage in daily activities. By facilitating rapid movement between locations, individuals can now access employment opportunities, educational institutions, and recreational facilities that were previously inaccessible. This heightened mobility has spurred economic growth by enabling people to commute over greater distances to work, thereby expanding labor markets and augmenting productivity.However, the proliferation of automobiles is not without its disadvantages. One of the most significant concerns is the environmental impact. Automobiles are substantial contributors to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby exacerbating climate change and posing health risks to urban populations. Studies have demonstrated that cities with high traffic volumes often experience severely compromised air quality, resulting in respiratory issues among residents.Additionally, road safety remains a pressing concern. The surge in automobile usage has been accompanied by a rise in traffic accidents, which claim numerous lives annually. Despite advancements in vehicle safety technology, human error, reckless driving, and distracted driving continue to pose considerable risks on the roads.In conclusion, while automobiles have undoubtedly enhanced modern life by providing unprecedented mobility and economic opportunities, they have also introduced significant challenges, including environmental degradation and safety concerns. A balanced approach is necessary, wherein fostering innovation in sustainable transportation methods, such as electric vehicles and public transit systems, can help mitigate these issues while preserving the benefits that automobiles bring to society. 
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;The debate surrounding whether children should follow in their parents' professional footsteps or forge their own paths is multifaceted. In my opinion, it is advantageous for children to pursue careers that resemble their parents', primarily due to the benefits of inherited expertise, guidance, and the perpetuation of family traditions.One of the primary reasons for this is that children often look up to their parents as role models and sources of inspiration for their understanding of the working world. By choosing careers similar to those of their parents, children can leverage the skills and knowledge that may have been passed down through generations. For example, a child of a doctor may have developed a strong foundation in science and empathy through informal learning at home. This prior familiarity can give children a significant edge as they embark on their own educational and career journeys.Furthermore, opting for a career similar to that of their parents can provide unique opportunities for mentorship and guidance. Having navigated the challenges of their own professions, parents can offer their children valuable advice, guidance, and networking opportunities, which are particularly invaluable in competitive fields where connections are crucial.Moreover, pursuing a profession similar to that of their parents can reinforce family values and work ethics, fostering a sense of continuity and belonging within the family. This can be a source of pride for both the children and the parents, as many parents find it rewarding to see their children thrive and carry on their legacy.In conclusion, while it is crucial for children to explore their own interests and passions, there are considerable advantages to following in their parents' professional footsteps. The benefits of inherited knowledge, mentorship, and the reinforcement of family values can provide children with a strong foundation, potentially leading to successful and fulfilling careers. Therefore, I firmly believe that it is often beneficial for children to follow careers similar to those of their parents.
248;Do you agree or disagree: To make children do well at school, parents should limit the time that children spend on watching TV and movies.;In 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.First of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.Moreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?Admittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.;The argument about whether parents should restrict their children's screen time to ensure academic achievement is a complex and multifaceted issue. I strongly support this perspective, as excessive television and movie viewing can divert time and energy away from studies, hindering academic success.Primarily, excessive screen time can replace time that could be better spent on educational pursuits. When children devote hours to watching shows or films, they often neglect important activities like homework, reading, and engaging in intellectually stimulating conversations with their family. This neglect can have a detrimental impact on their academic performance, leading to poorer grades and a lack of academic fulfillment. Furthermore, the content of many TV programs can be disengaging, or even counterproductive to acquiring knowledge and skills.Moreover, research has consistently demonstrated that a sedentary lifestyle, often associated with prolonged screen time, can have adverse effects on physical health. Poor physical health can result in decreased concentration, fatigue, and a lack of motivation, all of which significantly hinder a child's ability to study effectively. By encouraging children to engage in diverse activities outside of screen time, such as sports, reading, or creative hobbies, parents can promote a more balanced lifestyle that supports both mental and physical well-being.Additionally, the nature of television programming often prioritizes entertainment value over educational content. Many children are drawn to reality TV or cartoon series that do little to challenge their intellect or encourage critical thinking. In contrast, limiting screen time can foster a habit of seeking out more enriching forms of entertainment, such as documentaries, educational programs, or interactive learning games, which can provide a more intellectually stimulating experience.In conclusion, I firmly believe that limiting screen time is essential for creating an environment that fosters academic success. By moderating screen time, parents can promote a more well-rounded development in their children, supporting both their educational accomplishments and their overall well-being, and ultimately setting them up for success in their academic pursuits.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;The controversy over the high salaries of professional athletes has been an ongoing topic of discussion for a long time. While some people believe that athletes are overpaid, others argue that their salaries are warranted due to the unique demands and short career span of their profession. To comprehend this issue, it is necessary to examine various facets of the debate.A key factor contributing to the high salaries of athletes is the substantial revenue they generate for their teams, leagues, and associated industries. The professional sports industry is a multibillion-dollar market, attracting millions of viewers and resulting in lucrative broadcasting rights, merchandise sales, and sponsorship agreements. In this context, it seems logical to pay athletes a significant share of the revenue they generate, as their performances draw in fans and stimulate economic activity, thereby justifying their financial rewards.Furthermore, the career of a professional athlete is often brief, with most athletes reaching their peak in their 20s or 30s and facing the risk of career-ending injuries. As a result, high salaries can be seen as a form of compensation, enabling athletes to secure their financial future within a limited timeframe. It is also essential to acknowledge the rigorous training, discipline, and physical demands required to compete at such high levels. The dedication and sacrifices made by athletes are frequently underappreciated.However, critics argue that the high salaries of athletes overshadow the compensation of essential workers, such as teachers and healthcare professionals, who make significant contributions to society. This raises concerns about societal priorities and the emphasis on entertainment over essential services.In conclusion, the question of whether professional athletes deserve their high salaries depends on market forces, individual merit, and societal values. Although their salaries may seem excessive, they reflect the economic realities of the entertainment industry. It is crucial to strike a balance, ensuring that athletes are fairly compensated for their contributions, while also recognizing and rewarding the vital roles played by other professions in society.
250;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who canÕt accept othersÕ criticism canÕt succeed in group working.Ê;"In everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.First, the core of group working is ""consensus"". It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.Second, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: ""The good medicine tastes bitter“. Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.However, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.In conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident.";The capacity to receive and act upon criticism is a vital component of successful teamwork and collaboration. I strongly endorse the notion that individuals who are unable to accept and incorporate feedback from their peers will encounter substantial obstacles in achieving success within a team environment. Constructive criticism should not be viewed solely as a reflection of personal shortcomings, but rather as a valuable tool for personal and professional growth.The ability to accept criticism is first and foremost a demonstration of emotional intelligence, a quality that is essential for effective teamwork. When individuals are receptive to feedback, they exhibit a willingness to consider diverse perspectives and adapt their approaches as necessary. This adaptability fosters a collaborative atmosphere, where team members feel encouraged to share their ideas without fear of encountering defensiveness. Such an open culture enhances not only communication but also leads to the development of more innovative solutions, as a variety of viewpoints are taken into consideration.Furthermore, criticism offers crucial insights into areas where our vision may be limited. In team settings, where members often have specialized roles and responsibilities, it is likely that any one individual's perspective may be restricted. By accepting feedback from colleagues, individuals can gain a fresh perspective on their work, identify areas that require improvement, and ultimately contribute more effectively to the team's goals. Without this openness to feedback, team members risk stagnation and discouragement, which can impede project progress.Lastly, the ability to respond graciously to criticism is essential for nurturing strong interpersonal relationships within the team. Defensive or dismissive reactions to constructive feedback can lead to tension, erode trust, and result in conflicts. In contrast, individuals who embrace criticism can foster a supportive team environment where members feel valued and motivated to produce their best work.In summary, the ability to accept criticism is fundamental to success in team environments. It cultivates an atmosphere of trust, promotes personal and professional development, and enhances the overall performance of the team. Therefore, individuals who struggle with accepting feedback may find themselves at the periphery of effective collaboration, ultimately hindering the team's potential for collective success.
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;The discussion about whether children between the ages of 5 and 10 should be taught music and art in addition to traditional subjects like mathematics, science, history, and language is complex, but the evidence strongly supports the inclusion of these creative subjects in the educational curriculum.A key argument in favor of teaching music and art at a young age is their significant impact on cognitive development. Participating in music and art activities stimulates various parts of the brain, promoting skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. For instance, learning a musical instrument enhances not only fine motor skills but also mathematical understanding through rhythm and pattern recognition. Similarly, art encourages children to express their emotions and thoughts, thereby developing emotional intelligence and self-confidence.In addition to individual benefits, music and art education can substantially improve collaboration skills among children. Many projects in these fields require teamwork, which helps children develop their communication skills and learn to value different viewpoints. In an increasingly interconnected world, these interpersonal skills are extremely valuable.Moreover, music and art provide children with a deeper understanding and appreciation of different cultures. Learning about various musical traditions and art forms fosters a broad-minded worldview, enabling children to empathize with people from diverse backgrounds. This cultural awareness is especially crucial in today's global society, where interactions across cultures are common.Finally, engaging in creative activities can lead to a lifelong love for the arts, contributing to mental well-being and resilience. At a time when mental health concerns are rising among the young, the therapeutic benefits of music and art can offer essential outlets for self-expression and stress relief.In summary, teaching young children music and art alongside traditional subjects is not just advantageous, but it is crucial. By fostering creativity and emotional intelligence, we provide the next generation with the necessary tools to succeed both academically and socially.
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;The idea that teachers can best engage students in a subject by showing its relevance to their everyday lives is a persuasive argument that deserves consideration. When academic concepts are linked to real-world applications, students' motivation and interest in the subject often increase substantially.One key benefit of this approach is that it makes abstract theories more tangible. For example, when a math teacher explains the importance of geometry in fields such as architecture, engineering, or art, students are more likely to appreciate the subject. This connection can spark curiosity about the world, motivating students to explore their studies more deeply. By making these connections, teachers not only boost engagement but also encourage critical thinking, as students begin to see concepts and problems as interconnected rather than isolated.Furthermore, highlighting the relevance of a subject to real life can cater to different learning styles. While some students may excel with theoretical knowledge, others may find it easier to engage with practical projects that reflect real-world applications. For instance, a science teacher might have students conduct experiments that mimic industrial processes or environmental testing, thereby demonstrating the subject's significance.Another advantage of this approach is that students are more likely to remember concepts when they understand their usefulness. This type of learning, which focuses on relevance, can lead to better retention of knowledge and skills, as students feel more invested in their education and understand the reasons behind what they are learning. In an era where memorization can lead to disengagement, putting subjects into context can create a more dynamic and engaging classroom environment.In summary, connecting curriculum content to real-world applications not only sparks student interest but also prepares them for future challenges. By grasping the importance of their studies, students are likely to engage more deeply, cultivating a love for learning that will benefit them both academically and personally.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;"The discussion about how government budgets should be divided between protecting the environment and promoting economic growth has become more important in today's world. Although economic growth is necessary for a country's success, it's crucial to prioritize environmental protection to ensure long-term sustainability and well-being. There are several strong reasons why governments should allocate a larger portion of their budgets to environmental initiatives rather than focusing solely on economic development.One key point is that the economy's health is closely linked to the environment's health. Essential natural resources like clean air and water, fertile soil, and biodiversity are the foundation for industries such as agriculture and tourism. However, the rapid deterioration of these resources due to pollution and climate change can have severe economic consequences. Investing in environmental protection helps preserve these resources, ensuring they can continue to support economic activities in the future.Another critical reason is that climate change poses a significant threat that governments can no longer ignore. The increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires directly affect economic stability and infrastructure. By allocating a larger budget portion to environmental protection initiatives, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources and adopting sustainable practices, governments can mitigate these risks and build resilience against climate-related impacts.Furthermore, there's a growing global recognition that sustainable development can drive economic innovation. By investing in green technology and sustainable practices, governments can create new job opportunities, stimulate growth in emerging sectors, and attract foreign investment. This comprehensive approach addresses environmental challenges while also providing long-term economic benefits.In summary, while economic development is still a priority, it shouldn't overshadow the urgent need for environmental protection. By redirecting budget resources towards sustainable initiatives, governments will preserve the planet for future generations and foster a resilient economy equipped to face 21st-century challenges. The two goals aren't mutually exclusive; instead, they should be integrated to ensure a sustainable future for all."
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;As we approach a new era of groundbreaking technological innovations, I firmly believe that the number of cars on the road will decrease significantly over the next twenty years. This anticipated decline can be attributed to several interconnected factors, including the expansion of public transportation, urbanization, and the development of alternative mobility solutions.The enhancement of public transportation systems is already underway in numerous metropolitan areas. In response to the environmental consequences of carbon emissions and traffic congestion, governments are investing heavily in comprehensive public transport networks. The introduction of electric buses, light rail systems, and other innovations is not only reducing traffic congestion but also providing commuters with a more sustainable and efficient mode of transportation. As a result, people are likely to rely less on personal vehicles, opting instead for eco-friendly and efficient transportation options.Urbanization is also transforming the way we think about mobility. The increasing population density in cities is reducing the need for personal cars, as city planners prioritize pedestrian-friendly and cyclist-friendly infrastructure. This shift in cultural values emphasizes the importance of convenience and sustainability, making car ownership unnecessary for many urban residents.Furthermore, technological advancements such as autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing services are expected to contribute to the decline of car ownership. On-demand transportation services like Uber and Lyft are reducing the need for individuals to purchase and maintain personal vehicles. As autonomous cars become more prevalent, the concept of ownership may evolve to focus on shared usage, where individuals access vehicles as needed rather than owning them outright.In conclusion, the confluence of factors such as improved public transportation, urbanization, and innovations in mobility technologies suggests that car usage will likely decline over the next twenty years. The transition to a more efficient and sustainable transportation system is not only inevitable but also crucial for a more sustainable future.
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;The debate about whether university students need to attend classes has become increasingly prominent in recent years. Some people believe that as long as students can pass their exams, attending classes is not necessary. However, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint for several key reasons.Primarily, attending classes provides a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Exams may assess a student's ability to remember information or apply formulas, but they often fail to capture the subtle discussions and interactive learning that take place in the classroom. Interacting with professors and peers helps to clarify complex concepts, promote critical thinking, and develop essential skills that are difficult to acquire through solo study.Furthermore, attending classes helps to develop important life skills. University education is not just about acquiring academic knowledge, but also about personal and professional growth. By participating in lectures and discussions, students acquire valuable skills such as effective communication, teamwork, and time management. These skills are vital for success in the workplace, where collaboration and effective communication are essential.Additionally, regular class attendance promotes discipline and consistency. In a world filled with distractions, committing to a class schedule helps students establish a routine that can improve their overall productivity and focus. It instills a sense of accountability and responsibility, qualities that are highly valued in both academic and professional settings.Lastly, attending classes offers the inherent benefit of social interaction. Building relationships with fellow students and faculty can lead to valuable networking opportunities, collaborations, and friendships that extend beyond university life. These connections can be incredibly valuable when seeking internships, jobs, or recommendations.In conclusion, while passing exams is a crucial aspect of academic success, it should not be the only focus of university education. Attending classes enriches the learning experience, fosters personal and professional growth, and develops vital skills, making it a crucial component of university life.
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;"The idea that success is solely the result of hard work, with no consideration for luck, is a highly debated topic. I partially disagree with this perspective, as I believe that while hard work is essential for achieving success, luck also plays a significant and intertwined role.Firstly, it is undeniable that hard work is a crucial element of success. Traits such as diligence, perseverance, and consistent effort are necessary for individuals to reach their goals. Many successful people, including entrepreneurs, athletes, and artists, attribute their accomplishments to their hard work and dedication. This commitment not only enhances their skills but also builds resilience, enabling them to overcome challenges. The phrase ""hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard"" highlights the importance of effort in achieving outstanding results.However, it would be misguided to overlook the impact of luck on success. Luck can take many forms, including being in the right place at the right time, chance encounters, or unforeseen circumstances that give one person an advantage over another. For example, a skilled musician may practice diligently, but their discovery often depends on chance meetings with influential industry figures. Furthermore, external factors like socioeconomic background and access to resources can either aid or hinder progress, demonstrating how luck is intertwined with hard work.In summary, while hard work is undoubtedly a fundamental aspect of success, luck also plays a substantial role that cannot be ignored. The dynamic between effort and chance influences our life trajectories, indicating that success is often the result of both relentless hard work and the fortunate opportunities we encounter. Recognizing both elements provides a more nuanced understanding of achievement, reminding us that although we can control our efforts, we must also acknowledge the unpredictability of life's journey."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;The age-old debate about whether individuals learn more effectively on their own or with the guidance of a teacher has been a longstanding topic of discussion. Although there are compelling arguments on both sides, I strongly advocate for the benefits of having a teacher, as they offer distinct advantages that are difficult to replicate through independent study.One of the most significant benefits of teacher-led learning is the organized and structured environment they provide. By tailoring curricula to meet the specific needs of their students, teachers break down intricate subjects into digestible portions, allowing learners to establish a robust foundation and grasp fundamental concepts before moving forward. For example, a math teacher can provide a supportive framework, presenting problems of increasing complexity, which can be challenging to achieve without guidance.Furthermore, teachers provide instant feedback and personalized mentorship. When studying alone, it can be tough to pinpoint errors or misconceptions without an outside perspective. A teacher can offer valuable insights, enabling students to identify areas of strength and weakness, and focus on improving their skills. This face-to-face interaction facilitates a more efficient learning process, particularly for subjects that demand consistent practice, such as languages or writing.Another significant advantage of having a teacher is their capacity to motivate and inspire students. Their enthusiasm for a subject can spark a similar passion in learners, encouraging them to engage deeply with the material. Inspiring educators often illustrate real-world applications of lessons, merging knowledge with life experiences and thereby enhancing the learning journey.Although self-directed learning promotes self-discipline and critical thinking, I firmly believe that the benefits of having a teacher outweigh those of independent study. The expert guidance, structured approach, and motivational support provided by a teacher create a more engaging and productive learning experience. In the complex educational landscape of today, the role of a teacher remains indispensable in fostering informed and motivated students.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;The discussion around working from home versus working in an office has become increasingly prominent in recent years, driven by advancements in remote work technologies and changes in professional settings. Although both have their advantages, I argue that working from home with the aid of a computer and phone presents unique benefits that make it a more appealing choice for numerous individuals.One of the primary advantages of working remotely is its flexibility. Those who work from home typically have the freedom to create their own schedules, allowing them to maximize productivity during their most effective hours. This flexibility often results in higher job satisfaction and a healthier balance between work and personal life, as individuals can more easily manage their personal responsibilities. In contrast, office work usually requires adherence to a fixed schedule, which can be inconvenient for those with diverse commitments.Furthermore, working from home can lead to significant reductions in overhead expenses. By saving on commute costs and time, employees can redirect these resources towards other aspects of their lives, such as spending time with family or pursuing personal growth. Employers also benefit from reduced requirements for office space, leading to lower costs associated with maintaining a physical workspace.Remote work also promotes a more inclusive work environment. Individuals with disabilities or those facing challenges with commuting can excel in a home office setup, as it enables them to tailor their workspace to meet their specific needs.However, it's crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of remote work, including feelings of isolation and communication challenges. These issues can be addressed through the strategic use of technology and regular interactions with the team. In conclusion, while both work environments have their merits, the flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and inclusivity of remote work make it a more favorable option for many in the evolving landscape of modern work.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;In a society where conformity is frequently valued, the idea that individuals should strive to be like others rather than stand out from the crowd sparks crucial discussions about the nature of success. Although imitating successful behaviors and adopting widely admired traits has its advantages, I strongly argue against the notion that similarity should take precedence over individuality in the pursuit of success.Historical evidence supports the importance of embracing one's uniqueness. Visionary figures such as Steve Jobs and Vincent van Gogh achieved extraordinary success by venturing beyond conventional boundaries in their respective fields. Their distinct approaches led to the creation of pioneering technologies and captivating artworks that have had a lasting impact on society. These examples illustrate that embracing what sets us apart can be a potent driver of success.Furthermore, embracing individuality cultivates creativity and innovation. When people feel empowered to express their authentic selves, they often produce novel ideas and perspectives that challenge existing norms. The diversity of viewpoints facilitates collaborative problem-solving, an essential skill in today's interconnected and rapidly changing world. Research has shown that diverse teams in fields like technology, science, and the arts outperform homogeneous teams due to the rich variety of ideas and innovations they contribute.Additionally, pursuing authenticity can lead to greater personal fulfillment and satisfaction. When individuals attempt to conform to societal expectations, they may find themselves in careers or lifestyles that do not align with their genuine passions and values. This discrepancy can ultimately hinder their success, as true motivation often stems from pursuing one's unique interests and strengths.In conclusion, while adopting certain traits or practices from others can be beneficial, the pursuit of success should not compromise one's individuality. Embracing our differences fuels not only creativity and innovation but also leads to a fulfilling and authentic life. Ultimately, it is our unique qualities that often propel us towards true success.
260;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Younger school children (aged five to ten) should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science and history.Ê;Undoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.First of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. In addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.Admittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.In a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.;The importance of incorporating art and music into the curriculum of early childhood education, for children aged five to ten, cannot be overstated. As the educational landscape continues to evolve, I firmly believe that these subjects should be taught alongside traditional ones like mathematics, language, science, and history. The primary reason for this is that art and music play a crucial role in fostering creativity in young minds. Creativity is an essential skill in today's world, enabling individuals to think innovatively and solve problems in a multitude of fields, not just artistic ones. In an era dominated by automation and technology, encouraging children to explore unconventional solutions is vital. By introducing them to artistic expression, we stimulate their ability to think outside the box.Furthermore, education in art and music significantly enhances the emotional development of children. These subjects serve as a means of self-expression, allowing children to convey their feelings and experiences. In a structured educational setting, art and music provide a healthy outlet for processing emotions, thereby promoting emotional intelligence and mental well-being. For children who struggle with traditional subjects, engaging in creative activities can boost their self-esteem and overall well-being.Moreover, the inclusion of art and music in the curriculum can also improve cognitive functions. Studies have shown that exposure to artistic activities can lead to enhanced memory, focus, and critical thinking skills - all of which are crucial for achieving academic success across various subjects. For instance, learning a musical instrument demands discipline and concentration, skills that can positively impact performance in more conventional academic areas.In summary, making art and music a compulsory part of the curriculum for younger school children, in addition to core subjects, is beneficial for both their emotional and cognitive growth. It also prepares them for success in a complex, multifaceted world. An education that encompasses creativity will yield individuals who are adept at innovation and collaboration, setting them up for excellence in their future endeavors.
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;The experiences of young people today are distinctly different from those of previous generations, marked by unique challenges that have emerged as a result of significant societal, technological, and economic shifts. Although every generation faces its own set of obstacles, the nature and complexity of these challenges have evolved substantially over time.One major factor contributing to the distinctiveness of contemporary youth challenges is the rapid pace of technological advancement. Today's young adults are navigating a world where digital interactions, social media pressures, and instant access to information are the norm. This is a stark contrast to the experiences of their parents and grandparents, who primarily interacted face-to-face and dealt with less complex technology. As a result, modern youth are faced with complex issues such as managing online identities, dealing with cyberbullying, and navigating the intricacies of digital communication, which significantly impact their social and emotional well-being.Furthermore, the job market and career landscape have undergone profound changes, posing new challenges for young people. The burden of unprecedented levels of student debt, combined with a highly competitive job market that increasingly values specialized skills over traditional educational pathways, creates significant stress and uncertainty about career prospects and financial stability. While past generations also faced employment challenges, the contemporary economic environment is characterized by precarious job security, the rise of the gig economy, and the constant need for skill updating, thereby amplifying fears and anxieties related to career and financial security in ways that may not have been fully comprehensible to previous generations.Additionally, contemporary global issues such as climate change and socio-political unrest are generating a unique sense of urgency and anxiety among young people. Although past generations faced their own monumental challenges, including civil rights movements and world wars, the immediacy and scale of global ecological threats pose a new level of complexity. This affects young people's perception of the world and their sense of ability to influence change, presenting challenges that are distinct from those faced by their predecessors.In summary, while both current and past generations of young people encounter challenges, the specifics of these challenges are inherently unique to each era. The current global context, with its distinctive set of circumstances, necessitates an acknowledgment of these differences and underscores the importance of providing support and understanding that is tailored to the needs of today's youth.
262;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.First of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.Second, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won’t be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.;In today's fast-paced world, where change is constant, the discussion about whether it's better to have a broad understanding of multiple academic subjects or to specialize in one area is more relevant than ever. I firmly believe that having a wide range of knowledge across different disciplines is more advantageous than focusing solely on one specialty.The first advantage of having a broad base of knowledge is that it encourages critical thinking and creativity. When people make connections between different subjects, they often develop innovative ideas that might elude a specialist. For example, take the field of environmental science, which requires insights from biology, chemistry, economics, and policy-making. A student with a strong foundation in multiple areas is better equipped to handle complex environmental problems than someone with a narrow focus on one discipline.Another significant benefit of broad knowledge is its enhancement of adaptability in the job market. The professional world is constantly evolving, with many positions requiring skills that span across various fields. For instance, a technology professional greatly benefits from understanding not just programming, but also business principles, communication skills, and design. Having a broad educational background enables individuals to easily move between roles and industries, making them more competitive and resilient in the face of change.Moreover, broad knowledge cultivates empathy and cultural awareness. Being exposed to various disciplines often helps individuals understand different viewpoints, enhancing their ability to work effectively in diverse teams. This is especially crucial in today's interconnected global community, where the ability to communicate and collaborate with people from different backgrounds is vital for success.To summarize, while specializing can lead to expertise, the advantages of having a broad knowledge base are clear. It fosters innovation, boosts adaptability, and promotes cross-cultural understanding. In an increasingly complex world, a well-rounded education prepares individuals to navigate challenges more effectively than specialization alone.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;In the fast-paced world we live in today, innovation, experimentation, and a willingness to take calculated risks are key elements that often determine success. The notion that successful individuals are those who venture into the unknown and take bold steps, rather than sticking to familiar patterns, resonates deeply with me. Embracing this mindset not only accelerates personal growth but also develops resilience and adaptability - vital attributes for navigating life's complexities and achieving professional milestones.One of the primary benefits of exploring new horizons is the potential to uncover fresh opportunities that may remain hidden when adhering to traditional pathways. A prime example of this is the journey of Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple Inc. His relentless pursuit of innovative designs and cutting-edge technologies culminated in groundbreaking products like the iPhone and iPad, which revolutionized the tech landscape. By daring to explore uncharted territories, Jobs challenged conventional norms and ended up redefining entire industries, profoundly impacting the lives of millions. It's plausible that had he chosen to play it safe and stick with established methods, his technological contributions would have been significantly less profound.Moreover, embracing risk-taking plays a pivotal role in building resilience, which is essential for overcoming obstacles and staying ahead in today's competitive environment. By stepping out of their comfort zones and confronting challenges head-on, individuals can develop a robust ability to cope with failure and use it as a stepping stone for future success. This capacity to bounce back from setbacks, coupled with the adaptability to adjust strategies and plans according to changing circumstances, positions risk-takers for long-term success and sustainability in their pursuits. Ultimately, the combination of trying new things and taking thoughtful risks is a powerful strategy for personal and professional advancement, fostering a mindset that is both open to learning and resilient in the face of adversity.
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;In today's globalized world, where connections and collaborations are becoming increasingly vital, being able to establish and maintain strong relationships with others is often viewed as a key factor in achieving professional success. Although a solid academic foundation provides essential knowledge and skills, I firmly believe that the ability to interact and build relationships with others is equally, if not more, crucial for succeeding in one's future career.There are several reasons that support this argument. Firstly, the majority of professions rely heavily on teamwork and collaboration. As a result, employers are on the lookout for individuals who possess excellent communication skills, can empathize with diverse perspectives, and contribute to a positive and productive work environment. For example, in industries like marketing and healthcare, professionals are required to interact with a wide range of stakeholders, including clients, colleagues, and suppliers. An individual who can establish a connection with others and navigate complex social dynamics is likely to enhance team productivity and drive the success of projects. On the other hand, someone who excels solely in academics but struggles to form meaningful connections with others may find it challenging to make significant contributions in collaborative settings.Furthermore, the impact of networking should not be underestimated. Possessing strong interpersonal skills enables individuals to form meaningful and lasting professional relationships, which can lead to valuable mentorship opportunities and career advancements. For instance, attending industry conferences and events can often lead to unexpected connections that can significantly enhance one's career prospects. Individuals who can effectively engage with others in these settings often discover job opportunities and collaborative possibilities that those with a sole focus on academics might overlook.In addition, emotional intelligence - a critical aspect of interpersonal skills - enables individuals to manage their emotions and understand the feelings of others. This ability is vital for resolving conflicts, persuading others, and creating a supportive workplace culture. Employers are increasingly recognizing the value of emotional intelligence, acknowledging that employees who can navigate interpersonal challenges contribute to a thriving and positive organizational atmosphere.In conclusion, while academic achievement is undoubtedly important, the ability to relate well to others holds greater significance for future job success. Interpersonal skills not only enhance individual performance but also foster stronger, more cohesive teams and networks, ultimately leading to a more successful and fulfilling career.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;The impact of advertising on consumer behavior, particularly eating habits, cannot be overstated. It is undeniable that advertisements have the power to shape dietary choices, but it is overly simplistic to claim that they are the primary driver of unhealthy eating habits. In my opinion, while advertising certainly plays a role in promoting unhealthy food options, it is by no means the sole culprit.One of the primary ways in which advertising contributes to unhealthy eating habits is through targeted marketing campaigns, especially those aimed at children and adolescents. Advertisements for sugary snacks, fast food, and convenience meals often portray these options as appealing and exciting, thereby glorifying unhealthy eating. Young people, being highly impressionable, may develop a preference for these unhealthy foods due to repeated exposure to such advertising. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that the responsibility for dietary choices extends beyond advertising. Parents and guardians have a vital role to play in shaping their children's eating habits by providing healthy alternatives and educating them about nutrition, thus counteracting the influence of advertisements.Moreover, various lifestyle factors significantly influence eating habits. The fast-paced nature of contemporary life frequently leaves individuals with limited time to prepare nutritious meals, leading them to opt for quicker, often unhealthier options. Economic constraints also come into play, as cheaper fast food alternatives may be more accessible than their healthier counterparts. Additionally, emotional and psychological factors such as stress or binge eating can also drive eating behaviors, and advertising often exploits these vulnerabilities rather than creating them.In conclusion, although advertising undoubtedly contributes to unhealthy eating habits through its pervasive and persuasive messaging, it is just one of many factors at play. Dietary habits are shaped by a complex interplay of personal choices, familial influences, and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, addressing unhealthy eating habits requires a more comprehensive approach that moves beyond critiquing advertising, focusing instead on promoting education, improving access to nutritious foods, and fostering a supportive environment that encourages healthy eating.
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";The claim that television has ruined communication among friends and family is a topic of debate. Although it's true that TV can be a distraction and cause people to feel isolated, I believe that it hasn't destroyed communication, but rather changed it in both positive and negative ways.On the one hand, TV provides a shared experience that can bring people together. Watching shows or movies with others can start conversations and strengthen relationships among family and friends. For example, a family might watch a popular series together, which can lead to discussions about the characters and plot, and ultimately deepen their connection. In this way, TV can help people form closer bonds.Additionally, TV can be a source of information and inspiration that sparks conversations. News programs and documentaries inform viewers about current events and different cultures, leading to important discussions at home that encourage critical thinking and strengthen relationships. For instance, watching a documentary about climate change might lead a family to have a meaningful conversation about protecting the environment, which can enrich their communication.On the other hand, it's clear that watching too much TV can lead to less face-to-face interaction. Binge-watching can cause people to neglect spending quality time with loved ones. However, it's crucial to realize that this problem isn't with TV itself, but with how people manage their TV habits. Therefore, the impact of TV ultimately depends on individual choices and family dynamics.In conclusion, while TV has its downsides, it also has the potential to bring people together and inspire meaningful conversations. By being mindful of our TV habits and using TV as a tool to facilitate communication, we can harness its benefits and strengthen our relationships with family and friends. 
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;The role of sports and social activities in universities and colleges is vastly underestimated. Although academic programs and libraries are essential for students' educational growth, I firmly believe that sports and social activities are equally vital and warrant equal financial investment.Participating in sports is a key factor in helping students develop crucial life skills, including teamwork, discipline, and leadership. These skills are highly transferable to academic and professional environments. For example, team sports teach students the value of collaboration, a trait highly prized by employers. Moreover, engaging in sports has numerous physical benefits that contribute to overall well-being, which is essential for maintaining academic performance. Exercise has been proven to enhance concentration, reduce stress, and improve cognitive function, all of which are linked to better academic outcomes.Social activities also play a vital role in fostering a sense of community and belonging among students. The college years are a pivotal time in young adults' lives, and social interactions are crucial for personal growth. By providing opportunities for students to engage in social activities, such as clubs, organizations, and recreational events, universities promote inclusivity and diversity. These social interactions can lead to lasting friendships and professional networks that benefit students' personal and professional lives after graduation.Furthermore, institutions that adopt a holistic approach to education by investing in both academic programs and extracurricular activities produce well-rounded graduates. This, in turn, enhances the institution's reputation and appeal to prospective students.In summary, sports and social activities are essential components of the university experience, contributing to the development of students' minds, bodies, and social skills. As such, they deserve equal financial support alongside academic programs to ensure a balanced and enriching educational environment.
268;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. ;To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned, good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons. However, if one coniders the issue carefully, he or she may agree the title statement as I do.First of all, friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career. Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job. Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields, imagine when you are in trouble, you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you, so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible, even an esy phone call, instend of a series of complex solutions.Futuermore, no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company, relating well to people is also a importent issue. If top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them. Consequently, make a good relationship with them.On the other side, if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss, only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position.However, someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job. Studying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job. But imagine it, a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people, and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former, which person do you want to be? I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future.In my point of view, I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school.;The discussion about whether interpersonal skills or academic excellence is more crucial for achieving professional success is complex and multifaceted. Although both are undoubtedly essential, I firmly believe that the capacity to build strong relationships with others is becoming increasingly vital in the contemporary professional landscape.To begin with, the modern workplace is inherently based on collaboration. The majority of jobs require teamwork, where individuals from diverse backgrounds come together to achieve shared objectives. Studies have shown that employers tend to favor candidates who exhibit strong communication and interpersonal skills over those who excel academically but struggle to connect with their peers. The ability to convey ideas effectively, understand team dynamics, and manage conflicts is extremely valuable, as these soft skills often determine a team's overall productivity and morale.Furthermore, networking plays a vital role in advancing one's career. Establishing relationships with colleagues, mentors, and industry professionals can lead to numerous opportunities, including job offers, promotions, and collaborations. Individuals who can establish and maintain a strong professional network often find themselves in advantageous positions, regardless of their academic accomplishments.However, it is also important to recognize that academic knowledge provides a fundamental understanding necessary for many fields. Specialized skills and theoretical knowledge are essential in professions such as medicine, engineering, and science. Nevertheless, it is the practical application of this knowledge through collaboration and effective communication that ultimately drives success.In conclusion, while academic performance can provide initial access to career opportunities, the ability to relate well to others is essential for long-term success. As the workplace continues to evolve and become more interconnected and collaborative, soft skills will increasingly surpass academic achievements in importance. Therefore, developing strong interpersonal skills should be a top priority for aspiring professionals.
269;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? As modern life becomes more complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize;With the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.First of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.Equally important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.Finally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs. At this circumstances, they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where. It is obviously a huge waste of time. But if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination.In this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with.;In the fast-paced world of today, the intricacies of modern life demand that young individuals acquire outstanding planning and organizational abilities. I strongly endorse the notion that these skills are vital for navigating the complexities and opportunities presented by contemporary society.The vast amount of information available nowadays can be daunting for young people, who are exposed to a plethora of choices and opinions through the internet, social media, and other digital platforms. To make sense of this chaos and take informed decisions, the capacity to plan and organize is indispensable. It allows them to prioritize tasks, manage time efficiently, and maintain focus on what is truly important amidst numerous distractions.Furthermore, the pressures of academic life, combined with extracurricular activities and social obligations, necessitate that students develop expertise in time and resource management. By refining their organizational skills, young individuals can strike a balance between their studies, hobbies, and personal responsibilities, ultimately leading to a more gratifying and less stressful existence. A well-structured schedule enhances productivity, fosters a sense of accomplishment, and boosts self-confidence.Additionally, the modern workforce places a high value on planning and organizational abilities. In a competitive job market, employers seek candidates who can manage projects, collaborate effectively, and adapt to changing circumstances. Young people equipped with these skills will not only differentiate themselves but also navigate their career paths more successfully.Finally, the intricacy of global issues such as climate change, social inequality, and economic uncertainties requires young leaders who can think strategically and implement organized solutions. By nurturing these abilities, we empower the younger generation to become proactive catalysts for change.In conclusion, as life becomes increasingly multifaceted and interdependent, the ability to plan and organize is not just beneficial but essential for young people. These skills are crucial for personal success and for addressing the collective challenges of our time, making them a vital component of a young person's arsenal for navigating the complexities of the modern world.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;The question of whether university students should be required to attend classes or have the freedom to choose is a contentious issue, with compelling arguments on both sides. Nevertheless, I strongly advocate for making class attendance a requirement for university students.The primary reason for this is that attending classes provides a structured learning environment, which many students need to stay on track. Regularly scheduled classes help students develop a routine, manage their time effectively, and prioritize their academic responsibilities. In a university setting, where coursework can be demanding, this structure is essential for keeping students engaged and focused on their studies.Another significant advantage of attending classes is the opportunity for direct interaction with professors and peers. This interaction can greatly enhance the learning experience, as professors can clarify complex topics, answer specific questions, and lead discussions that promote a deeper understanding of the material. Engaging with classmates also fosters collaboration, promotes the exchange of diverse viewpoints, and helps develop critical thinking skills. These interactions can lead to valuable networking opportunities that may benefit students in their future careers.Furthermore, classes often include hands-on activities, demonstrations, and group projects that are difficult to replicate in online or independent study formats. These experiences are crucial for students in fields like sciences, engineering, and the arts, where practical application of knowledge is necessary.Although some argue that optional attendance promotes independence and responsibility among students, it may also lead to a lack of motivation and commitment to their education. During the formative years of higher education, it is crucial to instill habits of accountability and the value of collaborative learning.In conclusion, requiring university students to attend classes cultivates a structured and engaging educational environment, enhances interpersonal interactions, and enriches the overall learning experience. Therefore, I firmly believe that mandatory class attendance is essential for university students.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;In the modern digital era, telephones and email are generally perceived as essential tools for enhancing communication. However, I contend that these technologies have contributed to a decline in the personal nature of communication between individuals. The increasing reliance on impersonal communication methods has detracted from the richness and depth that human interactions once possessed.To begin with, it is essential to examine the characteristics of communication via email and telephone. Although these mediums facilitate swift information exchange, they are inherently devoid of non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and body language, which play a vital role in conveying emotions and intentions. For instance, a sincere apology delivered face-to-face enables eye contact and empathetic gestures, resulting in a more profound emotional connection. Conversely, emails and phone calls often lack the necessary nuance to convey genuine empathy, leading to misinterpretations or a sense of emotional detachment.Furthermore, the instantaneous nature of emails and text messages has given rise to a culture that prioritizes speed over substance, resulting in superficial conversations that lack depth. This trend can have detrimental effects on relationships, as individuals may engage in daily text exchanges yet neglect meaningful encounters that foster stronger bonds. The preference for the convenience of generic emails over heartfelt letters or casual in-person conversations risks the erosion of the personal touch that once characterized human interactions.Additionally, the pervasive presence of technology can create a sense of connection while simultaneously fostering feelings of isolation. Individuals may have extensive social media networks yet experience profound loneliness, as digital communication replaces genuine, meaningful relationships. This paradox highlights the deteriorating quality of interactions, despite the increased availability of communication channels.In conclusion, while telephones and email are invaluable for efficient communication, they inevitably diminish the meaningfulness of personal interactions. The unique emotional depth and connection derived from face-to-face conversations or handwritten letters are irreplacable, underscoring the importance of striking a balance between convenience and the essence of personal communication.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;The decision to live in a small town versus a big city is often influenced by personal tastes and lifestyle preferences. For me, the allure of a small town is undeniable. The peaceful atmosphere and strong sense of community that small towns embody are highly appealing.One of the main benefits of small town living is the more relaxed pace of life, which facilitates a less stressful lifestyle. Small towns offer easy access to nature and open spaces, such as parks, local farms, and hiking trails. For example, a leisurely walk down a quiet street lined with trees and filled with the sound of children playing is a welcome respite from the chaos of city life. This setting promotes mental health and encourages individuals to form deeper connections with their environment.Additionally, small towns nurture a strong sense of community and interpersonal connections. Neighbors know and look out for one another, fostering a cooperative and supportive spirit. Community events like fairs, farmers' markets, and picnics provide chances for residents to mingle and form lasting friendships. Unlike the anonymity that can come with city living, small towns cultivate a friendly, neighborhood atmosphere that can lead to meaningful relationships.Small towns are also generally more affordable, making it easier for residents to manage their finances. The lower cost of living enables individuals to purchase homes and live comfortably without the financial burdens that often come with city living. For those who prioritize financial security and stability, small towns offer more opportunities for a balanced and fulfilling life.In summary, although big cities may boast a wide range of activities and cultural experiences, my preference is for a small town. The peaceful lifestyle, close-knit community, and affordability of small towns create an environment that aligns with my personal values and goals, making it an ideal choice for me.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;In the constantly changing world of personal and professional growth, the decision to either stick with what you know or try new things plays a big role in how you develop as a person. I prefer to try new things and take thoughtful risks, because I believe it helps me grow as a person and discover new strengths I didn't know I had. This isn't just about wanting to improve myself, but also about the excitement of finding out what I'm capable of.Trying new things can make you feel very accomplished. For example, when I decided to learn how to play the guitar, it was tough at first - I struggled with chords and strumming patterns. But the happiness I felt when I made progress was worth the frustration. Each small win made me want to keep trying new songs and styles, which improved my music skills and helped me express myself in new ways. This experience taught me that trying new things can help me learn new skills and see things from different perspectives.Also, trying new things helps you adapt to new situations, which is very important in today's fast-changing world. By taking risks, I've learned to approach problems in creative and resilient ways. For instance, during my internship, I was given a project that needed data analysis skills, which I didn't have before. Instead of avoiding the challenge, I asked colleagues for help and used online resources to learn the necessary skills. The result impressed my supervisors and also deepened my understanding of how data informs decisions.On the other hand, while doing what you're good at can lead to expertise in one area, it often means you miss out on various experiences. Personal growth needs challenges and the willingness to face uncertainty. In a world that's changing quickly, adapting through exploration is necessary for both personal happiness and career success. Therefore, my tendency to try new things and take risks is a key part of my journey to become a more versatile and resilient person.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;"The significance of educating children on how to manage their finances effectively cannot be emphasized enough, given the growing complexity of the financial world. It is crucial to instill financial responsibility in children from a young age, as this lays the groundwork for them to become financially aware and capable adults.To begin with, possessing knowledge about finances gives children the tools they need to make smart decisions regarding money. Learning the fundamentals of creating budgets, saving, and spending money wisely enables children to distinguish between what they need and what they want. For example, when children receive money for doing chores, they can practice distributing the funds for different purposes, such as saving for something they want or donating to charity. This hands-on experience establishes the foundation for responsible financial actions, helping them understand the impact of their spending choices before they grow up.Moreover, teaching children about financial responsibility from an early age promotes the development of essential life skills, including setting goals and self-discipline. When children set savings objectives, whether it's for a new toy or an outing, they learn the value of waiting for what they want. This ability not only prepares them for future financial endeavors but also fosters a sense of accomplishment and confidence when they achieve their objectives.Furthermore, the earlier children learn about financial concepts, the more likely they are to apply these lessons in their adult lives. Research has demonstrated that individuals who were taught about managing money during their childhood years tend to exhibit healthier financial behaviors as adults, such as saving wisely, investing, and avoiding too much debt.In summary, educating children on how to manage their finances is vital for promoting financial responsibility. By providing them with the necessary skills to navigate financial challenges, we empower the next generation to make informed decisions, achieve their goals, and build a secure financial future. Such education is not just beneficial; it is essential for raising a responsible and economically empowered society."
275;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Dancing plays an important role in a culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;In every country, people do dance for fun, for entertrain, and for decrease a stress. Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture. For instance, I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom, king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture. The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.;"Dance undoubtedly holds a profound significance in cultures globally, functioning as a crucial means of expression, communication, and community cohesion. I firmly believe that dance is vital to cultural identity and heritage, and for good reason.To begin with, dance is an age-old form of expression that surpasses linguistic boundaries, allowing individuals to convey emotions, recount stories, and share experiences that may be challenging to put into words. Traditional dances, for instance, often narrate historical events or commemorate significant milestones in a community's life, thereby preserving narratives that enlighten and educate future generations. A case in point is the Hula dance of Hawaii, which intricately weaves storytelling into movement, encapsulating the rich traditions and beliefs of Native Hawaiian culture.Furthermore, dance cultivates a sense of community and belonging, as cultural dances frequently bring people together during festivities, celebrations, and religious ceremonies. This collective participation not only fortifies community bonds but also reinforces shared values and collective identities. In societies where dance is integral, such as the Samba in Brazil, these dance forms become beacons of cultural pride, promoting unity among diverse groups of people.What's more, dance serves as a means of preserving cultural heritage in an increasingly globalized world. Many indigenous cultures utilize dance as a tool to maintain their distinct identity amidst external influences. The Powwow dances of Native American tribes, for example, not only commemorate their heritage but also serve as vibrant demonstrations of cultural resilience and continuity. These performances not only reconnect participants with their roots but also revive interest among younger generations, ensuring that dance traditions are preserved over time.In conclusion, dance is more than just an artistic pursuit; it is a cornerstone of cultural expression and identity. Through its capacity to convey emotions, foster community, and preserve traditions, dance plays an indispensable role in enriching and sustaining cultures worldwide."
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;The current educational landscape is marked by a significant debate: should students focus on grasping ideas and concepts or on memorizing facts? I strongly believe that understanding concepts is more crucial than mere memorization. This stance is particularly relevant in today's fast-paced and complex world, where critical thinking and creativity are essential for tackling problems.Conceptual understanding facilitates in-depth learning, allowing students to establish connections between diverse areas of knowledge. When students comprehend the fundamental principles of a subject, they can apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios. For example, a student who grasps the concept of gravity can appreciate its implications across various scientific fields, from physics to astronomy. The ability to transfer knowledge is vital in an era where information is readily available, but meaningful application is often lacking.Furthermore, emphasizing concepts over rote memorization encourages the development of critical thinking skills. Students who explore ideas are motivated to ask questions, analyze situations, and formulate their own opinions. This process fosters a mindset that values inquiry, problem-solving, and critical thinking – essential traits for navigating life's challenges. In contrast, fact-based learning often results in superficial understanding, where students may recall information for exams but struggle to retain it or apply it in practical contexts.The digital age has also revolutionized access to information, making memorization less beneficial. With vast amounts of knowledge at their disposal, students should instead focus on grasping key concepts that facilitate deeper engagement with the material and promote a lifelong passion for learning.In conclusion, understanding ideas and concepts is the cornerstone of meaningful education, critical thinking, and adaptability in an ever-changing world. Therefore, prioritizing conceptual understanding over factual recall is crucial for preparing students to succeed in the future.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;I strongly believe that sports and social activities are equally as important as academic pursuits at universities and colleges, and therefore, should receive equivalent financial support. The primary goal of higher education is to facilitate learning and intellectual growth, but the overall development of students requires a balance between academic and extracurricular activities.The significance of sports and social activities cannot be overstated, as they play a vital role in maintaining students' physical health and well-being. The demands of college life, including rigorous coursework, can lead to stress and anxiety, making it essential to have outlets like sports to manage these pressures. Participating in sports not only helps to reduce stress but also fosters a sense of community, belonging, and important life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership. By investing in sports facilities and programs, universities provide students with skills that are beneficial beyond their academic years.In addition to sports, social activities greatly enhance the college experience by offering opportunities for personal growth, networking, and exploring diverse interests. Events like cultural festivals, workshops, and student clubs facilitate the development of social skills and can lead to meaningful, lasting connections that might not be formed in a purely academic setting. For example, involvement in clubs or extracurricular projects often results in the establishment of professional networks that are invaluable when searching for jobs after graduation.The integration of sports and social activities into a university's agenda also contributes to a more inclusive and diverse environment. By bringing together students from different backgrounds, these activities help break down social barriers, foster understanding, and encourage collaboration. This, in turn, enhances personal development and enriches the academic experience as a whole.In summary, while academic programs are the cornerstone of the university experience, overlooking the importance of sports and social activities would be detrimental to providing students with a well-rounded education. Allocating equal financial support to these areas is essential, as it not only promotes physical health and social skills but also prepares students for success in all aspects of life, making them well-rounded individuals capable of thriving in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;The advent of the internet has revolutionized the manner in which we obtain and disseminate information, sparking a contentious debate about its overall impact. Proponents of the internet argue that it serves as a vast repository of valuable knowledge, thereby empowering individuals with a profound understanding of virtually any subject matter. This unparalleled access to information has the potential to significantly enhance educational outcomes, foster a culture of self-directed learning, and cultivate a more informed citizenry. The availability of online resources such as academic journals, digital archives, and online courses enables individuals with internet access to explore a diverse array of topics. For example, online platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera offer complimentary or low-cost educational materials, rendering learning accessible to a global audience.On the other hand, there are legitimate concerns regarding the overwhelming proliferation of information on the internet. The sheer magnitude of available data can lead to confusion, misinformation, and the dissemination of falsehoods, as not all online content is credible or accurate. The proliferation of fake news and sensationalism has rendered it increasingly challenging for individuals to discern veracity from fallacy. This dilemma is exemplified by the dissemination of misinformation during critical events, such as electoral processes or global health crises, wherein public perception and action can be misguided by untrustworthy sources.In my estimation, while the internet undoubtedly offers immense benefits through its vast informational resources, it also necessitates a degree of prudence and discernment. It is essential for users to cultivate critical thinking skills that facilitate the evaluation of sources and the validation of information. Educational curricula should incorporate digital literacy, thereby equipping future generations with the requisite tools to navigate the complexities of online information effectively.In conclusion, the internet serves as a potent repository of knowledge, capable of augmenting our comprehension and engagement with the global community. Nevertheless, to fully realize its benefits, it is imperative that we address the challenges it presents and foster a society adept at discerning credible information from the multitude of voices competing for attention in the online sphere.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;The debate surrounding whether universities should implement a curriculum that encompasses a wide range of subjects or permit students to specialize in a single field has garnered significant attention. Both approaches have unique benefits, and the most suitable option often depends on the individual student's objectives and circumstances.Universities that advocate for a broad-based curriculum provide students with the opportunity to develop a diverse set of skills and knowledge. This approach promotes a comprehensive education, enabling students to explore multiple disciplines, including humanities, sciences, and arts. As a result, students foster critical thinking and creativity. For example, a biology major who also takes philosophy courses may acquire enhanced analytical skills and a moral framework for assessing scientific advancements. This interdisciplinary approach prepares students for a complex world where professions frequently require adaptable skills and the ability to collaborate across different domains.On the other hand, specializing in a single subject can be highly beneficial for students with a specific career goal in mind. In fields such as medicine, engineering, or law, where expertise is vital, in-depth knowledge is essential. A specialized program allows for intense study and practice, equipping students with the necessary skills and insights to excel in their respective fields. For instance, an engineering student who focuses solely on technical courses may develop a deeper understanding of advanced concepts necessary for real-world applications.Ultimately, determining which approach is superior is not a universally applicable answer, as it heavily relies on personal aspirations and career paths. Students with diverse interests may excel in learning environments that promote a well-rounded education, whereas those with a clear career objective may find greater success in specialized programs. A balanced approach that combines elements of both strategies could also be ideal, enabling students to acquire a broad foundational knowledge while delving deeply into their chosen specialization. This adaptability could ensure that students are well-equipped to handle future challenges in their academic and professional lives.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;The discussion surrounding government expenditure on space exploration versus meeting fundamental human needs on Earth is a multifaceted and crucial one. Although the appeal of exploring the cosmos is undeniable, I firmly believe that governments should prioritize allocating funds to address essential needs on our planet.The primary consideration should be to tackle pressing social issues. Millions of people globally lack access to basic necessities like food, clean water, healthcare, and education. Directing substantial funds towards space programs diverts attention and resources away from these vital areas. For example, the billions of dollars allocated to missions to the Moon or Mars could instead be used to alleviate poverty, support public health initiatives, or invest in renewable energy to combat climate change. Such efforts would yield immediate benefits, enhancing lives and contributing to a healthier society.Moreover, focusing on our planet allows for a more sustainable approach to progress. While technological advancements stemming from space research are valuable, many of these innovations can be developed concurrently with solving earthly problems. Investing in sustainable technologies can address climate challenges, reduce our environmental impact, and ensure Earth remains habitable for future generations.From a broader perspective, our responsibility to the planet and its inhabitants should take precedence over exploring the universe. Although space exploration has its advantages, such as fostering global cooperation and scientific progress, we must first ensure a basic level of well-being for all people. Ultimately, prioritizing spending on pressing earthly needs is an investment in both our immediate survival and a sustainable future for humanity. Therefore, it is imperative that governments concentrate their resources on solving planetary problems before exploring space.
281;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples in your answer. ;Nowadays, we are living in in the world which is absolutely complicated. Everything seem to be rush, and it have a lot of competition. These make people get stress. Thus, many people try to reduce their stress. There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress. in my opinion, reducing stress by listening to music, playing sports, and doing meditation are easy and practical ways.First of all, listening to music is a great way to relax. For example, when I go to office, I use public transport. I see many things such as traffic jam, crowded people at bus stop, and all so crowded people in buses. These make me stress. So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me. Consequently, I feel happy when I listen music.Second, another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise. For instance, I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time. These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress. Thus, after work, I always do exercise, and jogging is my favorite sport. I feel that after working out, I am easily to fall asleep. Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health.Third, meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress. when I have many things to think about, and this make me stress, I will do meditation. Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment, and it take few minutes. A way to do meditation is that I just sit down, close my eyes, and count my breath. These could relieve me from stress. In conclusion, there are many ways to reduce the stress. In my point of view, listening to music, exercising, and doing meditation are the most activities that people could do to escape from stress. It is are easy and usable. And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind.;In today's frenetic world, stress has become a ubiquitous problem affecting a large number of people. As individuals navigate the intricacies of modern life, discovering effective stress-reduction methods is crucial for preserving mental health. Among the numerous options available, I am convinced that engaging in physical activity, reading, and practicing mindfulness are among the most beneficial approaches to alleviate stress.The first of these methods, exercise, is a potent stress reliever. Physical activity stimulates the release of endorphins, which are hormones that enhance mood and foster a sense of well-being. Participating in activities such as running, swimming, or even walking can clarify the mind and provide a much-needed break from the pressures of daily life. For example, a study conducted by the Mayo Clinic found that just 30 minutes of moderate physical activity can significantly reduce anxiety levels and improve overall mood, confirming the long-held notion that a healthy body is essential for a healthy mind.Another effective method for escaping the stresses of life is reading. Immersing oneself in an engaging book allows individuals to temporarily step away from their worries and enter a different realm. Whether it's fiction, history, or self-help literature, reading has the power to transport readers, providing comfort, insight, and even amusement. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people turned to reading as a way to cope with isolation and uncertainty, highlighting the therapeutic benefits of reading.Lastly, practicing mindfulness and meditation has gained popularity as a method to combat stress. Mindfulness encourages individuals to focus on the present moment, fostering a sense of peace and reducing anxiety. Techniques such as deep-breathing exercises or guided meditations can significantly lower stress levels. Research from Harvard University indicates that mindfulness meditation can physically alter the brain, leading to increased emotional regulation and resilience.In conclusion, while there are numerous methods for reducing stress in modern life, exercise, reading, and mindfulness are particularly effective. Each of these methods addresses mental health challenges in unique ways, providing individuals with the opportunity to find relief and restore balance in their lives. By incorporating these practices into our daily routines, we can better equip ourselves to handle the stresses that arise in the contemporary world.
282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;The debate over whether teachers' salaries should be tied to their students' academic performance is a highly contentious issue, sparking a wide range of opinions on its effectiveness and fairness. Although the concept of linking teacher compensation to student outcomes may seem attractive at first glance, I strongly oppose this method.One major concern is the complexity of measuring student learning outcomes. A multitude of factors, including socioeconomic status, parental engagement, and individual learning abilities, influence student achievement, many of which are beyond a teacher's control. For example, a teacher working in a disadvantaged area with limited resources may face significant obstacles that impede student progress, regardless of their teaching quality. Punishing teachers in such situations for their students' performance could lead to demotivation and discourage talented individuals from pursuing a teaching career.Furthermore, the reliance on standardized testing as a primary measure of academic success is problematic. These tests often fail to capture the full range of a student's skills and knowledge. Students who excel in creative or critical thinking areas may not perform well on standardized tests, which could unfairly impact their teachers' evaluations. This narrow focus on specific metrics could lead to teaching methods that prioritize test preparation over comprehensive education, stifling creativity and critical thinking in favor of rote memorization.Additionally, teaching is inherently a collaborative process. It involves various stakeholders, including teachers, parents, and the community. Holding teachers solely accountable for their students' achievements overlooks the role of others in the educational ecosystem and oversimplifies the complex process of learning.In summary, while the intention behind linking teacher pay to student performance is understandable, it oversimplifies the complexities of the educational landscape. A more equitable approach would take into account a broader range of factors that contribute to student learning and acknowledge the dedication of teachers in facilitating growth, regardless of the circumstances.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;The question of whether films and TV shows should consistently portray stories where good triumphs over evil, and the virtuous are rewarded while the wicked are punished, is a topic worthy of consideration. I strongly support this idea, and my reasoning is multifaceted.Primarily, the media exerts a profound influence on shaping societal norms and values. When movies and TV programs feature narratives that uphold moral justice, they reinforce the viewer's faith in a just world. This is particularly beneficial for young audiences, who are still developing their understanding of ethics and morality. By observing good characters succeed and receive their due rewards, and bad characters face the consequences of their actions, children and adolescents learn invaluable lessons about the importance of integrity, compassion, and personal responsibility.Furthermore, such narratives provide emotional fulfillment and closure for audiences. The resolution of conflicts in favor of virtuous characters tends to evoke feelings of joy and optimism, thereby enriching the viewing experience. Stories that highlight the triumph of good over evil can inspire individuals to strive for moral excellence in their own lives, offering role models that promote positive behavior and ethics.Some may counterargue that reality often diverges from these neatly resolved narratives, where the wicked sometimes prosper and the virtuous suffer. Although this is true, it is essential to note that entertainment often serves as a reprieve from the harsh realities of life. Audiences are drawn to stories that depict justice because they seek affirmation of their beliefs and a temporary escape from life's unpredictability.In conclusion, I firmly believe that movies and TV programs should depict narratives where good people are rewarded and bad people are punished. This not only instills hope and fosters moral values in viewers but also enhances their overall viewing experience by providing satisfying resolutions. Ultimately, emphasizing justice in storytelling is a vital element in both entertainment and societal development, as it shapes the values and norms of audiences and provides a sense of emotional fulfillment and inspiration.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;The education landscape has undergone significant transformations in recent years, driven by the integration of technology. Distance learning and online computer classes have emerged as viable alternatives to traditional classroom-based education. Proponents of this shift argue that it can improve accessibility, customization, and overall efficiency in the education sector.A key argument in favor of online education is its ability to increase accessibility. Students from diverse geographical locations, including remote areas, can now access high-quality educational resources and instruction without having to travel. This has democratized education, allowing individuals who face barriers such as distance, financial constraints, or health issues to access learning opportunities that were previously out of reach. Moreover, online platforms cater to a diverse range of learners, enabling them to learn at their own pace and according to their individual schedules.Online learning also offers a level of customization that is often lacking in traditional classrooms. Unlike conventional classroom settings where the pace is dictated by the collective needs of the class, potentially leaving some students behind or others disengaged, online courses allow students to revisit materials and lectures at their convenience. This promotes a more personalized learning experience and fosters deeper subject matter understanding, alongside critical skills such as time management and self-discipline.While critics argue that the social interaction found in traditional classrooms is essential for personal development, technological advancements have enabled new forms of connection through virtual classrooms and discussion forums. Here, students can engage with peers and educators, providing a substitute for the social interactions found in physical classrooms.In conclusion, distance learning and online computer classes offer a modern solution to enhance the education system by making learning more accessible and customizable. As technology continues to evolve, it is crucial to evaluate these approaches critically, ensuring they complement the necessary human interactions integral to the educational experience rather than replacing them entirely.
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;My life has been profoundly impacted by several pivotal experiences that have significantly influenced my perspective and way of living. A particularly transformative moment occurred during my time volunteering at a local homeless shelter. Interacting with individuals struggling with homelessness broadened my understanding of the intricacies of societal issues, which I had previously only considered superficially. This experience instilled in me a sense of empathy and the value of human connection, teaching me to appreciate the complexities of people's lives. Witnessing the resilience of those facing adversity inspired me to cultivate gratitude for my own circumstances and to strive to make a positive difference in my community.Another experience that had a profound impact on my perspective was my family's relocation to a new city during my teenage years. Initially, this transition was difficult, as I had to leave behind friends and the comfort of familiar surroundings. However, it ultimately proved to be a valuable learning experience, fostering adaptability and open-mindedness within me. As I navigated this new environment, I developed an appreciation for diversity and a curiosity about the world around me. Exposure to novel cultures, ideas, and ways of life has encouraged me to seek out experiences that expand my understanding of different viewpoints and broaden my perspective.My academic pursuits have also played a significant role in shaping my outlook. Delving deeply into subjects such as philosophy and sociology has encouraged me to critically examine my beliefs and challenge societal norms. Discussions surrounding ethics, morality, and social justice have sparked a passion for advocacy within me, driving me towards a lifestyle that prioritizes fairness, equality, and compassion.In reflection, my experiences have collectively taught me the value of empathy, adaptability, and critical thinking. They have inspired me to live a purpose-driven life, centered around understanding others and driving positive change. The lessons I've gleaned from these experiences continue to guide my decisions and interactions, shaping my identity and commitment to living a life rooted in empathy, compassion, and a deep understanding of the world around me.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;Acquiring a foreign language can be a life-changing experience, offering access to new cultures, ideas, and opportunities. Individuals have the option to learn a foreign language either in their home country or in the country where the language is predominantly spoken. Both approaches have distinct benefits that suit different learning styles and objectives.Studying a foreign language in one's home country provides a structured learning environment, often with qualified instructors who offer personalized guidance. Language classes are generally more accessible, especially for those with busy schedules or commitments. Moreover, resources like textbooks, online courses, and study groups are easily available. This method typically helps learners develop a foundational understanding of grammar and vocabulary without the intensity of immersive situations. Nevertheless, it may limit exposure to authentic language use and cultural subtleties.In contrast, learning a language in its native context provides an unmatched immersive experience. Residing in a country where the language is spoken offers daily opportunities for practice, rapidly enhancing fluency and comprehension. Interacting with native speakers enables learners to acquire colloquialisms, slang, and cultural references often overlooked in a classroom setting. This real-world interaction fosters not only language skills but also cultural appreciation, enriching the learning experience.In my view, while both approaches are valuable, learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken is more beneficial for achieving fluency and a deeper understanding of cultural context. The ability to engage effectively with native speakers and experience the language as part of everyday life significantly accelerates the learning process. Ultimately, the most effective approach may be a combination of both environments, allowing learners to master the language's technical aspects at home while also immersing themselves in its practical application abroad. This comprehensive approach can lead to greater proficiency and cultural connection.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;If I had the opportunity to make a significant change to my hometown, I would prioritize upgrading its public transportation system. Despite its quaint small-town charm and strong sense of community, the town's heavy reliance on personal vehicles poses numerous challenges, including congested roads, poor air quality, and restricted access to vital services.Primarily, a well-functioning public transportation system would alleviate traffic congestion. The current dependence on cars for daily commutes, such as traveling to work, school, or running errands, results in overcrowded roads during peak hours, making it difficult for individuals to reach their destinations punctually. The introduction of an efficient public transit system, comprising buses or trams, would decrease the number of vehicles on the roads, leading to smoother traffic flow and reduced frustration for motorists.Furthermore, enhanced public transportation would have a profound positive impact on the environment. The large number of vehicles currently on the roads contributes to air pollution, which compromises the quality of life for residents. A reliable public transit system would encourage individuals to leave their cars behind, thereby decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a cleaner atmosphere. Cities like Amsterdam and Tokyo, which have invested heavily in public transportation systems, have witnessed notable improvements in air quality.Additionally, a comprehensive public transit system would greatly benefit individuals without access to private vehicles, including the elderly and low-income families. This would enable them to more easily access employment opportunities, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions. For instance, the lack of reliable public transportation can hinder individuals' ability to access job opportunities, thereby perpetuating poverty cycles.In conclusion, revamping the public transportation system would have far-reaching benefits, including alleviating traffic issues, environmental concerns, and enhancing the overall quality of life for all residents. By establishing a comprehensive public transit system, my hometown would become not only more efficient but also more inclusive, reflecting the values of community and sustainability that are essential to its charm and character.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;The idea of students evaluating their teachers has sparked significant discussion within the education sector. Although some people are skeptical about the value of such evaluations, I strongly advocate for encouraging students to provide feedback on their teachers' performance. This approach not only improves the overall learning experience but also gives students a sense of control and agency in their educational setting.One key advantage of student evaluations is that they offer unique insights into a teacher's performance. As the primary recipients of instruction, students are best placed to judge how effectively teachers convey information and manage their classrooms. For example, if students consistently find a teacher's explanations unclear or their teaching methods unengaging, this feedback can prompt the teacher to make necessary adjustments. By being informed about areas for improvement, teachers can modify their strategies to better meet the needs of their students, resulting in a more effective and enjoyable learning environment.Furthermore, permitting students to assess their teachers fosters a culture of transparency, open communication, and accountability. It creates an environment where feedback is welcomed and encouraged, which is crucial for both personal and professional development. Teachers who receive thoughtful criticism can utilize this feedback to refine their teaching techniques, thereby enhancing their performance and maintaining high levels of student engagement in their classes.Additionally, incorporating students into the evaluation process encourages them to take responsibility for their education and view themselves as stakeholders. As students learn to express their opinions on the quality of their education, they develop essential critical thinking and evaluation skills that will benefit them in their future pursuits. It empowers them to understand the value of their input, potentially leading to a more collaborative and respectful atmosphere in educational settings.In summary, introducing a system where students evaluate their teachers can have multiple benefits, ranging from improving teaching standards to empowering students. While it is essential that evaluations are conducted in a thoughtful and constructive manner, I firmly believe that student feedback is a vital component in the ongoing pursuit of educational excellence.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;When evaluating career paths, the decision to work for a large corporation or a small business often boils down to individual priorities and professional objectives. Although both settings have their advantages, I have a strong preference for working in a small company environment. This preference is rooted in the prospects for personal growth, the sense of community, and the potential to make a significant difference.One of the primary advantages of small companies is that they offer a unique opportunity for employees to take on diverse roles and responsibilities. This diverse experience is essential for personal and professional development. In smaller companies, employees are often involved in cross-departmental projects, which enables them to acquire a wide range of skills that might be harder to obtain in a larger organization, where job roles tend to be more specialized. This broad exposure not only enhances my professional capabilities but also makes my work experience more varied and rewarding.Another significant benefit of small companies is the collaborative and supportive culture that they foster. With fewer employees, colleagues often work closely together, creating a strong sense of teamwork and mutual support. This connection leads to a more enjoyable and engaging work environment, where employees feel valued and appreciated. The flat organizational structure typical of smaller companies encourages open communication, idea-sharing, and teamwork, leading to innovative solutions and a strong sense of belonging among team members.Lastly, working for a small business provides me with the opportunity to see the direct impact of my work. In a larger corporation, it's easy to feel like just another employee, but in a smaller setting, my contributions can have a significant effect on the company's overall success. This sense of purpose and fulfillment motivates me and increases my job satisfaction, making my work more meaningful and purposeful.In summary, the benefits of working for a small company, including opportunities for growth, close relationships, and the ability to make a tangible impact, closely align with my career aspirations and priorities. These factors make small businesses the ideal setting for my professional growth, development, and fulfillment.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;The debate over whether higher education should be available to all or only to the most academically gifted students is a highly contested issue that mirrors the values of the broader society. Advocates for universal access to higher education argue that it is a basic human right, emphasizing its role in empowering individuals and creating a more informed and enlightened society. By making higher education inclusive, societies can promote diversity, innovation, and a well-rounded workforce, which draws from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. Furthermore, in a rapidly evolving job market that increasingly demands advanced skills, it is essential that all students, regardless of their academic history, have the opportunity to pursue higher education.In contrast, those who support limiting higher education to high-achieving students believe that this approach preserves academic excellence and ensures the efficient use of resources. They contend that admitting only students who demonstrate strong academic capabilities fosters a competitive environment, motivating students to strive for excellence. This perspective often aligns with the concept of meritocracy, implying that individuals who exert more effort and achieve higher grades are more deserving of the chance to further their education.After considering both perspectives, I am inclined to believe that higher education should be accessible to all. The potential benefits to society of having an educated population outweigh concerns about academic standards. Access to higher education can act as a social equalizer, providing opportunities to individuals from all socio-economic backgrounds. Instead of limiting access to education, efforts should focus on enhancing preparatory programs in high schools to equip all students with the tools necessary for college success. By investing in education for everyone, society promotes equity, stimulates economic growth, and cultivates a culture of lifelong learning that benefits the community as a whole.
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;The discussion about the effects of computer games on students has gained momentum in recent years. Some people believe that playing computer games is a waste of time for students and should be limited. They think that gaming too much can lead to putting off tasks, lower grades, and negative effects on both physical and mental health.The main concern is that spending too much time gaming can hurt academic performance. Students can become so engaged in virtual worlds that they neglect their schoolwork and other important tasks. Studies have found that students who spend more time playing video games tend to have lower grades because they often choose gaming over homework, projects, or studying. This can add up and ultimately affect their ability to do well in school and pursue further education.Additionally, gaming can lead to a lifestyle with little physical activity, which can be bad for health. Many students spend hours in front of screens, which can lead to a decline in physical activity and result in health issues like obesity, heart disease, and poor posture. The immersive nature of gaming can also contribute to mental health problems like anxiety and depression. When students spend too much time gaming, they may also replace real-life social interactions with virtual ones, which can make these issues worse.It's essential to acknowledge that not all gaming is bad. However, it's crucial to practice moderation. When gaming is done in a controlled environment, where it doesn't interfere with school responsibilities or health, it can be a fun way to spend free time or a reward. Nevertheless, having unlimited access to computer games often leads to negative outcomes. Therefore, it's reasonable to set limits on gaming for students to promote a more balanced lifestyle that prioritizes education, health, and overall wellbeing.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;In the modern technological era, where both face-to-face collaboration and digital communication via email coexist, each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages when it comes to project execution. Nonetheless, I strongly advocate for prioritizing in-person project work among classmates and colleagues whenever feasible. The advantages of direct, face-to-face interaction surpass the convenience offered by remote communication methods.The primary benefit of in-person collaboration is that it cultivates stronger, more meaningful relationships and a profound sense of community within the team. When team members share the same physical workspace, they are more inclined to participate in unplanned discussions, brainstorming, and joint problem-solving, which not only strengthens team unity but also facilitates the development of trust and rapport among individuals. This, in turn, leads to enhanced teamwork, as team members become more invested in the success of their peers and the project as a whole.Furthermore, face-to-face communication allows for immediate feedback and clarification, which is crucial for resolving misunderstandings promptly and maintaining project momentum. Real-time dialogue enables individuals to pose questions and receive instantaneous responses, thereby minimizing the risk of miscommunication that often accompanies written exchanges. Non-verbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, also significantly contribute to more effective communication and understanding, aspects that are frequently lost in digital correspondence.Although emails provide convenience and flexibility, they can result in communication delays due to non-instantaneous responses. Moreover, lengthy and complex email threads can become bewildering and overwhelming, leading to crucial details being overlooked. Consequently, for effective collaboration, face-to-face interactions are more beneficial.In summary, while both communication methods have their utility, in-person collaboration yields superior relationships, immediate feedback, and clearer comprehension. Prioritizing face-to-face collaboration can substantially enhance the quality and success of group projects, making it the preferred approach for both classmates and colleagues.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;"The traditional role of university professors has been complex, involving both teaching and research duties. Although cutting-edge research is crucial in academia, I firmly believe that professors should prioritize student education. A balanced approach is necessary, but providing high-quality education to students should take precedence for several compelling reasons.Primarily, the main objective of educational institutions is to promote learning and development. University students aim to acquire knowledge in their field, as well as develop essential critical thinking and analytical skills. Professors play a vital role in this process, shaping students' intellectual growth and preparing them for their future careers. If professors dedicate too much time to research at the expense of teaching, the quality of education may decline, resulting in a gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.Furthermore, the educational experience encompasses more than just delivering content; it involves guidance, mentorship, and personal interaction. Professors who are more invested in teaching can establish stronger connections with their students, offer meaningful advice, and inspire them to pursue their passions. Such relationships can substantially enhance student motivation and performance, creating a more stimulating academic environment.On the contrary, research is indispensable for driving innovation and advancing a field's knowledge base. Nevertheless, when professors prioritize research over teaching, they risk neglecting their responsibility to shape the next generation of thinkers and leaders. Universities should perceive teaching and research as interrelated and complementary; however, teaching should be viewed as the cornerstone upon which effective research is founded.In summary, while research is essential for knowledge progression, the fundamental duty of university professors remains the sacred trust of education. By allocating more time to teaching, professors can have a profound and lasting impact on their students, equipping them with the necessary skills to succeed in a rapidly evolving world."
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;The debate over whether independent learning or teacher-guided learning is more effective is a multifaceted issue that differs significantly from person to person. Both approaches have distinct benefits and can accommodate various learning styles, which in turn affects the quality of the educational experience.Independent learning enables students to create a personalized educational path, where they can delve into subjects at their own speed. This self-directed approach fosters autonomy, promoting the development of self-discipline, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. Students who learn independently often exhibit a deeper passion for the subject matter, as they are able to select topics that resonate with them. Furthermore, they have the flexibility to adapt their learning techniques to suit their preferences, whether through reading, online courses, or hands-on experimentation.In contrast, learning with a teacher offers a structured and guided approach, providing direction, feedback, and support. A skilled teacher can provide clear explanations, address doubts, and present complex concepts in an understandable manner. Teachers are also able to identify students' strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to tailor lessons that cater to individual needs. Moreover, the classroom environment encourages social learning, where students engage in discussions, share perspectives, and gain from diverse viewpoints. The interactive nature of teacher-led learning can also motivate students who thrive in a community setting, providing encouragement and accountability that may be lacking in solo study.Ultimately, the effectiveness of learning independently or with a teacher depends on individual learning styles and needs. While some students may find independence stimulating and conducive to in-depth exploration, others may require the support and guidance of an experienced instructor to navigate complex topics. A balanced approach that integrates both methods often yields the most satisfying results, combining the benefits of self-directed learning with the valuable insights provided by skilled educators.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;In today's rapidly changing world, technology is frequently seen as a means to make life easier, streamlining daily tasks and improving overall well-being. However, a closer look reveals that technological advancements often lead to increased complexity, rather than simplicity.A prime example of this is the widespread use of smart devices. Initially, devices like smartphones and smart home systems were meant to make life simpler, allowing users to control various aspects of their lives with ease. But as these devices have become more advanced, their operating systems and applications have also become more complex. This can lead to frustration, as users must deal with constant updates, connectivity issues, and compatibility problems. Tasks that were once straightforward, such as turning on lights, now require navigating multiple apps, understanding complex settings, and troubleshooting issues.Social media platforms also highlight the paradox of technological progress. Designed to bring people together, these platforms often create feelings of isolation and anxiety instead. The curated online personas lead to unrealistic comparisons, and the constant stream of notifications creates a sense of urgency to stay updated. This complexity in social interactions can worsen mental health issues, which is the opposite of the intended goal of improving social connections.Furthermore, automation, once seen as a way to reduce workloads, has led to job displacement and economic uncertainty, requiring workers to constantly update their skills. In conclusion, while technology has the potential to simplify our lives, the reality is more complex. As we incorporate these tools into daily life, it's essential to be aware of the complexities they introduce and ensure that we utilize their benefits without getting overwhelmed by the complications they may cause. 
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";In recent years, distance-learning programs have experienced significant growth, with the COVID-19 pandemic being a major catalyst. Although some people believe that these programs are inferior to traditional in-person education, I argue that distance learning can be just as effective, with some notable limitations.One of the main benefits of distance learning is its accessibility. It allows students to participate in courses from anywhere globally, thereby removing geographical barriers to education. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for individuals with work or family commitments, as they can pursue their studies without having to relocate or make significant changes to their schedules. Moreover, online education is often more affordable, as it eliminates costs related to transportation, accommodation, and course materials.The quality of distance-learning programs has also been improved by technological advancements. Interactive platforms, live lectures, and collaborative tools create an engaging educational environment similar to traditional classrooms. Many programs incorporate multimedia resources, such as videos, podcasts, and forums, which cater to different learning styles and enable students to engage with the material in a personalized way.However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of distance learning. A significant drawback is the lack of face-to-face interaction, which is vital for developing interpersonal skills and building professional networks. In-person education provides a sense of community and camaraderie that enhances the learning experience. Additionally, some disciplines that require hands-on experience may not be suitable for online learning.In conclusion, while distance-learning programs offer advantages in terms of flexibility and accessibility, they cannot fully replicate the experience of in-person education. A balanced approach that combines both formats may provide the most comprehensive educational outcomes, allowing students to benefit from the strengths of both modalities. This integrated approach can help maximize the effectiveness of distance learning while also providing the benefits of traditional in-person education.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";The debate about teenagers balancing school with part-time jobs has been ongoing across different societies, with some arguing that it hinders academic progress. However, I strongly believe that working while studying offers numerous benefits, including the development of essential life skills and financial independence, which are invaluable for young individuals.One of the primary advantages of teenagers having jobs is that it teaches them responsibility and time management. Juggling work and school commitments requires meticulous planning and prioritization, skills that are vital in adulthood. As students manage their schedules, meet deadlines, and fulfill job responsibilities, they undergo significant personal growth. For example, a part-time retail worker learns to balance assignments, shifts, and personal life, preparing them for the rigors of higher education or future careers.Furthermore, working while studying provides teenagers with practical experience that can significantly enhance their job prospects. In a competitive employment market, having any form of work experience, even part-time, can give them a notable edge over their peers upon graduation. Through their jobs, students can develop crucial soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are highly valued by employers. This experience can also help them discover their interests and career aspirations early on, enabling them to make more informed decisions about their educational pathways.Another significant benefit of teenagers working is that it instills financial literacy. Earning their own income and managing expenses and savings teaches them budgeting, financial decision-making, and the value of hard work. This financial independence can alleviate some pressures associated with student life, allowing them to contribute to their education or pursue extracurricular activities without solely relying on parental financial support.In conclusion, although there are potential downsides to teenagers working while in school, such as potential impacts on academic performance due to time constraints, the benefits of developing a strong work ethic, responsibility, and financial acumen far outweigh these negatives. Therefore, I firmly believe that part-time employment can be a profoundly positive and enriching experience for students, offering them invaluable skills and experiences that extend far beyond their academic years.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;The age-old debate about whether to learn a foreign language in one's home country or in a country where it is natively spoken has been a longstanding topic of discussion among language learners. Both approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses, which can greatly influence the language learning process.Studying a foreign language in one's own country has several advantages. It provides access to organized courses and qualified instructors who can help learners navigate the complexities of grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary. This method allows learners to progress at their own pace in a controlled environment. Additionally, learners can benefit from materials that are adapted to their own cultural background, making it easier to understand. Language schools and community colleges offer a wealth of resources, making this option accessible to a large number of people.However, immersing oneself in a country where the language is spoken offers a unique chance to apply language skills in real-life situations and integrate into the local culture. Immersion can greatly accelerate language acquisition, as learners engage in everyday conversations, pick up colloquial expressions, and practice listening to native speakers. The need to communicate in real-world scenarios can significantly improve confidence and fluency, which may not be replicated in a formal classroom setting. Moreover, cultural immersion provides a deeper understanding of the language's subtleties and the lifestyle that surrounds it.In my opinion, while learning a language in one's own country is beneficial for acquiring foundational skills, the immersive experience of learning a language abroad is ultimately more effective for achieving fluency and cultural understanding. The practical benefits of interacting directly with native speakers and adapting to life in a new culture outweigh the advantages of a structured learning approach. For those who have the opportunity, studying abroad can enhance both language skills and personal growth, resulting in a more comprehensive language learning experience.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;"The discussion about the ideal school vacation structure for students has sparked a range of perspectives, with some advocating for a single lengthy break and others supporting multiple shorter breaks. I strongly believe that having several short vacations throughout the year is the most beneficial approach, as it boosts learning, reduces burnout, and provides regular opportunities for leisure activities.The primary advantage of short vacations is that they offer students frequent breaks, which help prevent academic exhaustion. Prolonged periods of schoolwork without adequate rest can result in mental and physical fatigue, as well as decreased motivation. Short breaks serve as crucial mental health intervals, allowing students to rejuvenate and return to their studies with revitalized energy and focus. For example, a week-long break after a challenging term enables students to refresh their minds, leading to improved productivity and engagement when they return to class.Furthermore, incorporating short vacations into the academic calendar provides flexibility in learning. By planning their study schedules around these breaks, students can alleviate the overwhelming pressure that often accompanies prolonged periods of continuous study. Shorter breaks also enable students to engage in revitalizing activities, such as outdoor pursuits, hobbies, or personal interests, contributing to a more holistic educational experience.Additionally, short vacations facilitate opportunities for families to bond and spend quality time together throughout the year. Coordinating travel plans around a single long vacation can be challenging for many families; in contrast, shorter breaks allow for diverse family activities and experiences, fostering stronger relationships.In summary, although a long vacation may seem appealing, the benefits of multiple short vacations, including enhanced mental well-being, increased educational flexibility, and improved family interaction, make this structure more suitable for the diverse needs of students in today's fast-paced educational environment."
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";"The phrase ""Never, never give up"" encapsulates a potent philosophy that fosters tenacity and resilience in the face of hardship. I firmly endorse this sentiment, as it encapsulates a fundamental truth about pursuing objectives and personal aspirations.Initially, persistence is frequently the distinguishing factor between triumph and defeat. Notable individuals, such as Thomas Edison and J.K. Rowling, epitomize this concept. Edison's renowned statement, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work,"" underscores his unwavering pursuit of innovation despite innumerable setbacks, ultimately culminating in the invention of the light bulb, which revolutionized the world. Similarly, Rowling encountered numerous rejections before finally publishing the Harry Potter series, now a global sensation. Their journeys exemplify that unrelenting dedication frequently yields extraordinary accomplishments.Furthermore, the process of striving for an objective imparts valuable life lessons. When individuals confront obstacles, they cultivate attributes such as resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving skills. For example, a student struggling to master a challenging subject may initially feel disheartened. However, through perseverance - attending extra tutoring sessions or dedicating additional study hours - the student not only acquires knowledge but also develops confidence and tenacity. These qualities are invaluable, equipping individuals to navigate future challenges, both professionally and personally.It is essential, however, to acknowledge that ""never giving up"" does not imply blindly pursuing unfruitful avenues. Occasionally, it is necessary to reassess objectives, adapt strategies, or shift focus. Nevertheless, the core message remains unchanged: persistence is vital. In conclusion, the adage ""never, never give up"" serves as a powerful reminder that dedication and resilience are integral to realizing one's dreams. Embracing this philosophy can undoubtedly yield personal growth and the eventual fulfillment of one's aspirations."
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;The age-old debate about whether to indulge in the fruits of one's labor or to set aside earnings for future use has sparked a longstanding discussion. Although both sides of the argument present compelling points, a balanced approach is, in my opinion, the most sensible way forward. On the one hand, reveling in one's earnings can greatly enhance the quality of life, while on the other hand, saving can provide a sense of security and tranquility for the years to come.Spending one's earnings as they are received can result in instant satisfaction and a more fulfilling existence. Life-enriching experiences such as globetrotting, fine dining, or participating in hobbies can profoundly impact one's life. For example, an individual who allocates a portion of their income towards traveling may create lifelong memories, broaden their cultural understanding, and gain a newfound appreciation for the world. These experiences can also facilitate personal growth, enabling people to appreciate their surroundings more deeply. Moreover, using one's money can boost overall well-being, as research indicates that spending on experiences yields greater happiness than accumulating material possessions.On the other hand, the importance of saving money should not be overlooked. Setting aside money not only readies individuals for unexpected events and unforeseen circumstances but also offers a safety net, ultimately leading to greater financial liberty in the long term. For instance, those who invest in retirement funds early on can reap the benefits of compound interest, ensuring a comfortable lifestyle in their later years. Furthermore, saving money can alleviate the stress associated with financial uncertainty, giving individuals the autonomy to make choices about their professions and lifestyles without the burden of debt weighing them down.In conclusion, while there are undeniable advantages to both spending and saving money, the solution lies in achieving a balance between the two. Enjoying one's hard-earned money contributes to a more satisfying life, while prudent saving paves the way for future financial security. By finding this balance, individuals can savor life's joys today while simultaneously preparing for tomorrow.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;In today's fast-paced world, the decision to rush through life or adopt a more leisurely pace is often a reflection of one's values and lifestyle. I personally prefer a slower pace, and I do so for several compelling reasons: it enhances my well-being, allows for deeper connections with others, and fosters a greater appreciation for life's experiences.First and foremost, embracing a slower pace has a profound impact on my overall well-being. The relentless pace of modern life can lead to stress, burnout, and a decline in both mental and physical health. By slowing down, I can prioritize self-care, practice mindfulness, and focus on activities that bring me joy, such as meditation and long walks in nature. These practices allow me to recharge, reflect, and cultivate a sense of calm, ultimately promoting a healthier lifestyle that is often compromised by rushing.Furthermore, a slower pace enables me to form more meaningful connections with those around me. When I take the time to engage with others, I can be fully present in our interactions, which in turn fosters genuine and lasting relationships. For instance, I treasure weekends spent with loved ones, where we share meals, play games, and exchange stories without the pressure of time constraints.Lastly, living life at a slower pace allows me to appreciate the beauty in everyday moments. Without the rush to the next task, I can pause to notice the simple joys: a breathtaking sunset, the laughter of friends, or the aroma of a home-cooked meal. This mindfulness and gratitude enrich my experiences, making each moment feel significant and valuable.In conclusion, while some may thrive in the rapid pace of modern life, I find peace and fulfillment in embracing a slower pace. By prioritizing my well-being, nurturing my relationships, and appreciating the beauty in everyday life, I am able to cultivate a more rewarding, meaningful, and fulfilling existence.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;The discussion surrounding the allocation of land for human purposes, such as agriculture, housing, and industry, versus the conservation of habitats for endangered species is intricate and has multiple layers. Although human development is essential for societal progress and economic growth, I firmly believe that preserving the natural habitats of endangered species is of equal importance and should not be compromised for the sake of human expansion.The preservation of biodiversity is crucial for maintaining the stability of ecosystems, and endangered species often fulfill vital roles within their environments, contributing to ecological equilibrium. For example, the decline of pollinators such as bees can have severe repercussions for agriculture and food production. Consequently, conserving land for these species not only ensures their survival but also indirectly guarantees our own food supplies. If we continue to prioritize short-term human requirements without regard for the natural world, we risk initiating a cycle of environmental degradation that ultimately jeopardizes our own well-being.Furthermore, the loss of biodiversity can lead to a decline in the quality of life for future generations. Green areas and wildlife contribute to essential ecosystem services, including clean air and water, which are vital for human health and survival. Economic models that prioritize development over conservation often overlook these long-term benefits and can thus be considered shortsighted. Investing in sustainable practices, such as environmentally friendly agriculture, can fulfill human needs while maintaining ecological balance.Moreover, the protection of endangered species can stimulate tourism and recreational activities that boost local economies. Many communities thrive on ecotourism, showcasing their unique wildlife and natural landscapes. This can provide income while fostering a greater appreciation for nature, ultimately leading to increased support for conservation efforts.In conclusion, while human needs are essential, they should not overshadow the importance of preserving land for endangered animals. A comprehensive approach that incorporates sustainable development can ensure that both human and environmental needs are met, ultimately resulting in a healthier planet for all its inhabitants.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;The question of whether university students should be required to attend classes or have the autonomy to decide for themselves is a highly debated topic. Although both sides of the argument present valid points, I firmly believe that mandatory attendance is necessary for several crucial reasons.Primarily, attending classes provides a structured environment that facilitates effective learning. The university setting offers a unique chance for students to interact directly with their professors and peers, leading to a dynamic exchange of ideas and viewpoints. This face-to-face interaction not only enhances the understanding and retention of course material but also allows for discussions that go beyond what textbooks can offer. Moreover, regular class attendance helps students develop essential life skills such as discipline and time management, which are vital for achieving academic success and thriving in professional life.In addition to the academic benefits, the social aspect of attending classes is also significant and should not be underestimated. The university experience is multifaceted, encompassing not only academic growth but also personal development and networking opportunities. Students who regularly attend classes are more likely to form meaningful relationships with their peers and professors, establishing a supportive community that can lead to lasting collaborations and friendships. These connections can prove invaluable in their future careers, offering access to networking opportunities and professional references that might be inaccessible to those who choose to study in isolation.On the contrary, advocates of optional attendance argue that it promotes personal responsibility and self-motivation among students. However, this approach can also have negative consequences. Without the requirement to attend classes, some students may struggle with managing their time effectively and prioritize leisure activities over academic responsibilities. This lack of engagement can have a profound impact on their academic performance and overall university experience.In conclusion, while the concept of optional attendance may seem appealing due to its emphasis on personal freedom, the advantages of mandatory class attendance, including a structured learning environment, social engagement, and the development of crucial life skills, outweigh the arguments in favor of allowing students to miss classes. By ensuring attendance, universities can provide a more comprehensive and enriching educational experience for their students.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;The impact of technology on our daily lives has been profound, simplifying various aspects and making life easier in countless ways. Automation, improved accessibility, and enhanced communication have all contributed to streamlining our daily routines, allowing us to prioritize what is truly important.A key benefit of technology is its ability to automate tasks. Automated systems across different industries have boosted productivity and efficiency, reducing the need for manual labor. Household appliances like washing machines and dishwashers, for instance, have significantly reduced the time spent on domestic chores. Additionally, various applications and software can now handle financial management, schedule appointments, and even facilitate online grocery shopping, giving people more time to focus on leisure and personal growth.Technology has also vastly enhanced access to information and services. The internet has become a vast knowledge base, enabling individuals to acquire new skills, explore different cultures, or seek medical advice from the comfort of their own homes. Telemedicine platforms have made it possible for patients to consult with healthcare professionals without the need to travel, simplifying the process of accessing medical care. These innovations have not only saved time but also made essential services accessible to a broader audience, transcending geographical boundaries.The way people communicate has undergone a significant transformation thanks to technology. The advent of smartphones and social media has revolutionized how people stay in touch, facilitating instant communication over long distances.

Through automation, enhanced access to information, and better communication, technological advancements empower individuals with the necessary tools to navigate daily challenges with ease. Ultimately, embracing technology can lead to a more organized, fulfilling, and simplified existence.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";The current media landscape is dominated by an excessive fascination with the personal lives of celebrities and public figures, which I strongly believe is unwarranted and detrimental. This intense scrutiny of famous individuals' private lives not only shifts focus away from pressing global issues but also distorts the public's perception of reality.The media's fixation on celebrity gossip and scandals is a significant concern, as it redirects attention from critical issues that demand coverage. Important topics such as socio-political issues, climate change, and economic instability are frequently overshadowed by trivial celebrity news, like relationship updates or fashion choices. During major events, such as elections or natural disasters, the media often prioritizes sensational stories about public figures over vital news that educates and informs the public. This creates a society that is underinformed about significant issues and overly invested in celebrity culture.Furthermore, the constant examination of celebrity lives can create unrealistic expectations and standards among the public. The portrayal of a glamorous lifestyle, often presented through filtered and sensationalized content, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with perfection, particularly among young and impressionable audiences. This can cause individuals to internalize unrealistic benchmarks for their own lives, prioritizing superficial accomplishments, beauty, and wealth over intellect, hard work, and character.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the media devotes excessive attention to the personal lives of celebrities, which not only distracts from essential global issues but also perpetuates a superficial understanding of success and personal worth. A more balanced approach to media coverage, prioritizing substantive content over sensationalism, could foster a healthier and more informed society. By shifting the focus away from celebrity gossip and towards more meaningful topics, we can promote a more nuanced and informed understanding of the world around us.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;The debate between settling in one location and exploring new horizons has long been a subject of introspection for many individuals. Each lifestyle has its own advantages, and the choice ultimately depends on one's personality, circumstances, and aspirations. As for me, I have always been drawn to the idea of relocating to discover new places, and I'd like to explain why.Primarily, the experience of moving to a new location unlocks a multitude of new opportunities and experiences. Visiting new destinations enables us to discover diverse cultural practices, try new foods, and learn about different ways of living. Every location has its own unique history and customs, which broaden our understanding of the world and foster adaptability and a wider perspective - essential qualities in today's globalized society. For example, being exposed to different social norms can challenge our existing worldview and encourage us to become more open-minded and empathetic towards others.Furthermore, moving to a new place can give us a newfound sense of excitement and purpose. The prospect of starting anew in an unfamiliar environment can be incredibly motivating. It creates an atmosphere of possibility and exploration, which stimulates our creativity and challenges our minds, often leading to personal discoveries that might not be possible in a more static environment.On the other hand, staying in one place provides stability and a sense of belonging, which are essential for our emotional well-being. Having strong connections with friends, family, and the community is vital for our mental health. However, I believe that we can also form meaningful connections in new locations. Although moving can be transient, it can also lead to diverse and rewarding relationships.In conclusion, while both options have their benefits, the thrill of discovery and the opportunities for personal growth that come with exploring new locations are what ultimately appeal to me. The journey of seeking new experiences not only changes us, but also enriches our lives, making them more complex and interesting.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;When it comes to choosing a place to live while attending university, students are faced with a crucial decision. The two main options are university dormitories and apartments in the community, both of which have their own set of advantages. By understanding the differences between these two options, students can make informed decisions about their living arrangements.University dormitories offer several unique benefits. For one, they are typically located near campus, making it easy for students to get to classes, the library, and other activities. This proximity saves students time and energy, which can improve their overall academic experience. Moreover, dorm life encourages a sense of community and social connection among students. With numerous opportunities to interact with peers, students can easily form friendships and participate in group activities. The dorm environment is also supportive, with resident advisors available to help resolve conflicts or address concerns. Another advantage of dormitories is that they often include amenities such as meals, laundry facilities, and utilities in the housing package, simplifying students' daily lives.In contrast, living in community apartments provides students with independence and flexibility, which can be particularly appealing to those looking to transition into independent adult life. Apartments usually offer more space and privacy than dormitories, allowing students to personalize their living space. Furthermore, students have the freedom to choose their own roommates or live alone, catering to their individual preferences. Community living also gives students the chance to explore different neighborhoods, experience local culture, and broaden their university experience beyond campus life.From a personal perspective, I would opt to live in a community apartment. The independence it offers aligns with my lifestyle and aspirations for self-sufficiency. I think that taking care of my own living space and responsibilities would enable me to acquire essential life skills. Additionally, the opportunity to engage with the local community, experience diverse cultures, and build a broader social network is important to me. Overall, while both options have their advantages, I find the benefits of living in a community apartment to be more in line with my personal objectives.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;"The debate over prioritizing speed versus accuracy in the workplace has never been more relevant than it is today. I strongly support the idea that, in many cases, it's more beneficial to prioritize speed, even if it means risking mistakes, rather than emphasizing absolute correctness at the cost of slowing down. This viewpoint is shaped by the demands of the modern world, the rapid pace of technological advancements, and the necessity of adaptability in an ever-changing environment.The swift evolution of technology has significantly altered the work landscape, necessitating that businesses respond almost immediately to consumer demands and market trends to maintain competitiveness. For example, in software development, companies that can quickly launch updates or new products often gain a larger market share, even if the initial versions have minor imperfections. These can be rectified in later releases, underscoring the importance of prioritizing speed for continuous innovation and adaptability.Furthermore, working at a rapid pace cultivates a culture of experimentation and learning. In creative fields, the process of taking risks and making mistakes is crucial for development. Quick iterations enable teams to test ideas, learn from errors, and refine their approach, resulting in better outcomes over time. Notably, companies such as Google and Amazon are celebrated for their ""fail-fast"" approach, where employees are encouraged to quickly launch ideas without the fear of failure, fostering an environment of innovation.However, it's essential to acknowledge that speed should not compromise quality. A balanced approach is crucial, where workers are encouraged to prioritize speed while also establishing mechanisms for rapid error correction. This balance promotes an efficient work environment while ensuring that core practice standards are maintained.In conclusion, while the importance of accuracy is undeniable, the pressures of modern society and the benefits of an agile work culture suggest that, at times, prioritizing speed, even with the risk of errors, can lead to greater innovation and success. This approach allows for adaptability, continuous learning, and the ability to stay competitive in a fast-paced world."
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;I strongly disagree with the idea that university students don't need to attend classes as long as they can pass their exams. While being able to pass exams shows a certain level of understanding, attending classes offers many benefits that go beyond just getting good grades.The main advantage of attending classes is that they provide a setting where students can interact with each other and with their teachers. This leads to discussions that stimulate critical thinking and encourage students to learn more about the subject matter. This kind of interactive learning is often missing from self-study or online learning. Many teachers use special teaching methods, such as group projects, debates, and presentations, which are hard to do outside of a classroom.Attending classes also allows students to build valuable relationships with their peers and professors. These connections can be very important for networking, getting guidance, and working together on projects. Talking to professors during their office hours can give students advice and insights that go beyond what's taught in class, making their education more meaningful.Furthermore, going to classes regularly helps students develop self-discipline and time management skills. Having to attend classes at set times helps students create routines and habits that are necessary for succeeding in any future career. This kind of self-discipline is often a good indicator of how well someone will do in the long run, both in academics and in their career, which just passing an exam may not show.Lastly, the university experience is not just about learning academic things, but also about growing as a person and developing socially. By attending classes, students become part of a bigger community and are exposed to different viewpoints, which is important for preparing them for the complexities of the real world.In conclusion, while passing exams is an important measure of academic success, it's not the only thing that matters for a fulfilling and enriching university experience. Attending classes contributes significantly to students' intellectual, social, and personal growth, making it essential for students who want to get the most out of their higher education.
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;The caliber of education provided by universities is shaped by a multitude of factors, with the compensation of professors being a significant one. I firmly believe that universities should allocate a larger portion of their budget to increase professorial salaries, as this strategic investment has the potential to yield considerable enhancements in the quality of education.Primarily, offering higher salaries enables universities to attract and retain faculty members of the highest caliber, possessing both extensive experience and expertise in their fields. By presenting competitive remuneration packages, universities are better positioned to secure top talent in a fiercely competitive job market. This encompasses not only scholars renowned for their expertise but also those with a proven ability to teach and conduct research effectively. For instance, esteemed institutions such as Stanford and Harvard have managed to uphold their prestigious standings, in part, due to their capacity to attract illustrious scholars who impart their knowledge and insights to students.Secondly, enhanced salaries serve to bolster faculty motivation and overall job satisfaction, leading to improved educational outcomes. Professors who feel appreciated and fairly compensated are more inclined to engage profoundly with their students, dedicate time to developing curricula, and explore innovative teaching methodologies. This heightened commitment enriches the educational experience, fostering an environment conducive to student growth and success. Research indicates that motivated educators are correlated with enhanced student performance and higher retention rates, thereby creating a virtuous cycle of success beneficial to the university community at large.Furthermore, higher salaries can motivate professors to invest additional time and resources in research and professional development. This, in turn, has a profound impact on students, as professors engaged in current research can impart fresh perspectives and cutting-edge knowledge within their classrooms. For example, a professor actively involved in their field can offer students learning experiences that mirror the latest advancements and challenges, thereby keeping the educational content contemporary and relevant.In conclusion, augmenting salaries for university professors is a crucial strategy for elevating the quality of education. By attracting skilled faculty, fostering their motivation, and encouraging ongoing research and development, universities can establish a vibrant educational setting that ultimately benefits both students and society at large.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;"The notion that pets should be treated as part of the family sparks a range of opinions, yet I firmly believe in the validity of this statement. Dogs and cats, in particular, often become indispensable members of our families and households, earning the right to receive love, care, and respect similar to that given to human family members.One of the primary reasons for this is the deep emotional connection that forms between pets and their owners. Pets possess a unique ability to offer companionship, comfort, and unconditional love, providing a constant presence during times of joy and sorrow. They serve as loyal supporters, much like human family members, helping to alleviate feelings of loneliness and anxiety. This bond creates a sense of belonging and well-being that benefits both the pet and the owner.Furthermore, treating pets as family members directly improves their quality of life. When pet owners dedicate time, resources, and attention to their pets' well-being, it leads to happier, healthier animals. This dedication includes providing regular veterinary check-ups, proper nutrition, mental stimulation, and physical exercise - all of which are crucial for a pet's overall health. By treating pets like family, they are viewed not just as possessions, but as living beings worthy of respect and care.Additionally, the valuable lessons pets teach us about empathy, responsibility, and compassion should not be overlooked. The commitment to caring for a pet mirrors the obligations we have towards our human families, promoting a sense of responsibility, especially in children, and reminding adults of the importance of treating all living beings with compassion.In conclusion, considering pets as family members enhances their lives and positively impacts the emotional well-being of their human companions. The strong bonds that form between species demonstrate that love and care can transcend species; pets deserve our love, affection, and attention just as our human family does. Embracing this viewpoint can lead to a more fulfilling life for both pets and their owners, fostering deeper connections and a greater sense of well-being for all involved."
313;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind. Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace. I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.Primarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.Secondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. Besides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.To sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.;In today's fast-paced world, there is a common misconception that prioritizing speed over accuracy is essential to achieve results quickly. However, I strongly disagree with this notion, as I believe that working accurately is more important than rushing through tasks and risking mistakes. The primary reason for this is that mistakes can have severe and long-lasting consequences, particularly in critical fields such as healthcare, engineering, and finance. For example, in the medical field, a hasty diagnosis or treatment plan can put a patient's health or even life at risk. Similarly, errors in engineering due to a rushed review process can result in catastrophic failures, demonstrating that the costs of mistakes can greatly outweigh the benefits of speed. Thus, prioritizing accuracy over speed is crucial not only for individual safety but also for maintaining organizational integrity.Furthermore, many modern workplaces emphasize the importance of quality alongside speed. Companies such as Apple and Toyota have shown that a meticulous approach can lead to innovative products that stand the test of time. Their focus on quality assurance has led to customer loyalty and long-term success, demonstrating that thorough work fosters trust and reliability - both of which are invaluable in business.Additionally, rushing through work can lead to a cycle of rework, ultimately resulting in inefficiencies. A study by the Lean Enterprise Institute found that organizations that spend more time on planning and quality control upfront can save time and resources in the long run. This approach minimizes the need for corrections that arise from hasty decisions, highlighting the importance of careful and deliberate work.In conclusion, while working quickly can be beneficial in certain situations, it is essential to strike a balance between speed and quality assurance. The risks associated with making mistakes in a rush underscore the need for careful and deliberate work to ensure accuracy. Therefore, in a world that values rapid results, we should never compromise on the importance of correctness.
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;The age-old debate about whether to reside in a small town or a big city has been a longstanding one, with each lifestyle presenting its own set of advantages and drawbacks. On a personal note, I have always been inclined towards small-town living, and this preference is largely due to the strong sense of community, the more relaxed pace of life, and the picturesque natural surroundings that are typically characteristic of small towns.One of the most attractive features of small-town living is the tight-knit community that it fosters. In such settings, neighbors often know and interact with one another, creating an environment that is both supportive and secure. This feeling of belonging can give rise to numerous meaningful friendships and a sense of safety, which is sometimes lacking in the anonymity of urban life. Local events such as farmers' markets, town fairs, and seasonal festivals provide opportunities for residents to interact and bond with one another, thereby fortifying community bonds.Furthermore, small towns are generally marked by a slower pace of life, which can be a breath of fresh air in today's fast-paced world. Without the chaos and frenzied pace of city life, residents can indulge in a more laid-back lifestyle that enables them to appreciate their surroundings and spend quality time with family and friends. This, in turn, can lead to reduced stress levels and an enhanced sense of overall well-being. For example, leisurely strolls, impromptu picnics, or simply spending time outdoors can become everyday pleasures rather than occasional treats.Moreover, small towns are frequently nestled in areas of natural beauty, offering a plethora of outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, and camping. The proximity to nature not only promotes a healthy lifestyle but also serves as an escape from the hustle and bustle of urban living. Being able to bask in the beauty of star-filled nights and breathe in fresh air is a privilege that many city dwellers do not have the luxury of experiencing.In conclusion, while big cities may boast convenience and thrills, my inclination towards small-town living is rooted in the strong sense of community, the relaxed pace of life, and the closeness to nature. These aspects contribute to a fulfilling lifestyle that prioritizes interpersonal relationships and overall well-being, making small towns an ideal choice for me.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";The question of whether government funding should prioritize new construction projects over the preservation of historic buildings is a contentious issue, and I strongly argue against the idea that new developments should take precedence. Although community growth and development are crucial, the importance of preserving historical and cultural heritage cannot be emphasized enough.Historic buildings are vital as they provide a tangible connection to our past, embodying the stories and experiences of previous generations. They give communities a sense of identity and continuity, serving as reminders of their origins. By investing in preservation, the government pays tribute to these narratives and fosters a sense of community among its citizens. This connection to history enhances community pride, stimulates interest in local culture, and is essential for social cohesion.Additionally, preservation often has economic benefits. The restoration and maintenance of historic buildings can attract tourists, supporting local businesses and generating community revenue. Many cities have successfully transformed their historic districts into vibrant attractions, drawing visitors from around the world. Moreover, adapting existing structures is often more cost-effective and environmentally sustainable than demolishing old buildings to make way for new constructions.Prioritizing new developments over preservation also risks diminishing the unique characteristics of a community. In a world where cities are increasingly becoming homogeneous, those that lose their historical architecture can become unremarkable and dull, contributing to a loss of diversity in urban landscapes.In conclusion, while new infrastructure and buildings are undoubtedly necessary for growth and development, they should not overshadow the importance of preserving our historical and cultural heritage. By investing in our past, we honor our heritage, boost our economy, and enrich our communities for future generations. The preservation of historic buildings is not only a matter of cultural significance but also a sound economic and social strategy that benefits both current and future generations.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;"Life is replete with obstacles, but despite their intimidating nature, I strongly believe that the majority of challenging experiences ultimately yield invaluable life lessons. These experiences have the power to cultivate resilience, impart crucial skills, and drive personal development.To begin with, overcoming adversity can significantly enhance one's resilience. For example, when students encounter academic setbacks, such as failing a critical exam, they are compelled to persevere. Although the initial feeling of disappointment can be dispiriting, it frequently motivates them to adopt more effective study habits and seek assistance when necessary. This process not only enhances their academic performance but also instills a sense of resolve that can be applied to future challenges, whether in academic or personal pursuits.Furthermore, difficult experiences can serve as potent teachers of essential life skills. Consider an individual who assumes a leadership role in a community project, only to encounter opposition and unforeseen complications. Through this experience, they acquire vital skills such as conflict resolution, teamwork, and effective communication. These competencies are indispensable in numerous areas of life, including professional endeavors. For instance, professionals often encounter challenging situations with colleagues or clients; having previously learned to navigate difficulties, they are better equipped to handle future conflicts with greater ease.Lastly, challenging experiences play a substantial role in fostering personal growth. An individual who has endured a breakup may feel devastated at the time, yet this experience frequently leads to introspection and heightened emotional intelligence. They may gain deeper insights into their own needs and boundaries, ultimately resulting in more fulfilling relationships in the future.In conclusion, while challenging experiences can be painful and overwhelming, they often function as catalysts for resilience, skill development, and personal growth. By embracing these challenges as opportunities for growth, we can transform our perspective on adversity and equip ourselves for a more promising future."
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";The proposal to charge drivers a fee for driving on busy city streets during peak traffic hours is a thought-provoking idea that deserves careful consideration. I strongly support this concept, and for good reason.The primary advantage of such a fee is that it can substantially decrease traffic congestion. In many urban areas, congestion leads to wasted time, increased air pollution, and higher stress levels for commuters. By introducing a fee, cities can encourage drivers to consider alternative transportation methods, such as using public transportation, cycling, or walking. Cities like London and Singapore have already seen significant reductions in traffic congestion after implementing road pricing schemes, which not only alleviate traffic jams but also contribute to a more efficient public transportation system.Another significant benefit of this fee is that the generated revenue can be invested in public infrastructure. This can include maintaining and enhancing public transportation systems, improving cycling and pedestrian pathways, and expanding green spaces. This creates a positive cycle where reduced traffic leads to improved urban environments. Additionally, these funds can be used to subsidize transportation costs for low-income individuals, making it easier for them to access essential services and job opportunities.The environmental advantages of reducing traffic congestion should not be underestimated. With fewer cars on the road, there are lower carbon emissions and improved air quality, both of which are essential for mitigating climate change and promoting public health.In summary, charging drivers a fee for driving on busy city streets during peak hours is in line with the broader goals of urban sustainability and enhanced quality of life. It promotes responsible transportation choices, generates funds for vital public services, and has a positive impact on the environment. By adopting this strategy, cities can create a more sustainable and efficient urban future.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";One of the most effective ways for parents to prepare their teenagers for adulthood is by encouraging them to take on a part-time job. This approach is supported by several compelling arguments.Primarily, part-time employment helps teenagers develop a sense of responsibility. As they learn to balance their job with school and other obligations, they acquire essential time management skills. This skillset is invaluable as they enter adulthood, where handling multiple responsibilities becomes commonplace. Mastering schedules, deadlines, and commitments builds crucial skills that are necessary in both the workforce and everyday life.Furthermore, part-time work provides a valuable opportunity for teenagers to hone their interpersonal and professional skills. Interactions with colleagues, clients, and supervisors enable them to refine their communication skills and grasp the importance of teamwork. These social abilities are equally as vital as academic knowledge in navigating adult life, as they play a key role in forging relationships, networking, and advancing careers.Part-time employment also offers teenagers a taste of financial independence. With their own income, they can gain an understanding of the value of money, budgeting, and saving. This introduces them to financial literacy, a fundamental skill that will serve them well in managing future expenses, debt, and investments. Early exposure to financial responsibility can lead to more informed financial decisions in adulthood.Additionally, part-time jobs provide teenagers with a glimpse into the real world, allowing them to explore various career paths and understand the work environment. This exploration can prompt them to reflect on their future ambitions, focus on their education, and appreciate the value of perseverance and hard work.In summary, urging teenagers to take part-time jobs is a wise strategy for parents to help prepare them for adult life. These experiences foster responsibility, social skills, financial literacy, and career exploration, ultimately equipping them with the tools needed to tackle the challenges and opportunities that await them.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";Academic success relies heavily on studying, and students tend to have unique preferences when it comes to their approach to learning. While some students excel in quiet, individual settings, others benefit more from collaborative group studies. I, personally, have always been inclined to study alone, and this preference is rooted in several key advantages.The primary benefit of studying alone is the ability to maintain a high level of focus. By creating a personalized study environment, I can eliminate distractions such as conversations with peers or differing study speeds, allowing me to fully engage with the material. This uninterrupted focus enables me to absorb information more effectively, resulting in a more profound understanding of intricate subjects.Furthermore, solo studying gives me the autonomy to control my study timetable and methods. I can delve into topics at my own speed, allocating more time to complex concepts without feeling pressured to keep pace with my peers. This tailored approach also permits me to experiment with various study techniques, such as mind maps, flashcards, or practice quizzes, to determine which ones work best for me. For instance, when preparing for finals, I discovered that working through practice problems on my own significantly reinforced my comprehension more than discussing them with classmates.Additionally, studying independently fosters self-discipline and accountability. It compels me to take charge of my learning, an essential skill that extends beyond academics into life. As I overcome challenges on my own, I develop resilience and confidence in my capabilities.In summary, although group studies offer social interaction and collective learning, my preference for solo studying stems from the heightened focus, personalized pace, and opportunities for self-improvement it offers. I find that solitude provides the most effective setting for achieving academic success.
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;The choice between being self-employed, working for someone else, or running a business reflects fundamental personal preferences regarding work, autonomy, and risk tolerance. On a personal level, I prefer self-employment because it provides the autonomy to pursue my passions, make my own decisions, and create a work-life balance tailored to my unique needs.Self-employment allows individuals to shape their careers around their passions and strengths, giving them the power to choose projects that resonate with their personal and professional interests. As my own boss, I have the liberty to select projects and clients that align with my vision, rather than adhering to a predetermined corporate agenda. This freedom to choose fosters a sense of fulfillment, motivation, and often leads to higher quality work output. For instance, a self-employed graphic designer can pick clients whose projects align with their artistic vision, allowing for more creative and innovative work.Furthermore, self-employment promotes greater independence in decision-making and overall autonomy. Unlike traditional employment where office politics and strict protocols can hinder progress, being self-employed enables me to design my work environment and operational processes. This level of autonomy not only feels liberating but also facilitates more innovative and adaptable problem-solving approaches. I can adjust strategies quickly in response to market feedback or personal insights without the need for prolonged approval processes.Self-employment also presents the opportunity for achieving a more balanced work and personal life. By having control over my schedule, I can allocate time for personal interests, family, and self-care, aspects often compromised in traditional employment settings. Although self-employment comes with its share of uncertainties and challenges, the benefit of living life on my own terms makes it an appealing choice.In summary, while working for someone else or owning a business has its own set of advantages, self-employment is the path that best aligns with my ideal of a fulfilling, autonomous, and successful career. The independence, creativity, and flexibility inherent in self-employment are invaluable, contributing significantly to my overall happiness and professional success.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";The global debate about whether to preserve historic buildings or replace them with modern constructions is a pressing concern for many cities. The preservation of these buildings is vital for maintaining cultural heritage, fostering a sense of community, and supporting local economies.Historic buildings act as physical connections to a city's history, providing valuable insights into its cultural, architectural, and historical significance. Cities such as Paris and Rome are prime examples of successful preservation, where historic architecture is not only a reflection of their rich past but also a defining aspect of their identity. This unique character attracts tourists, significantly contributing to the local economy.Furthermore, preserving historic buildings is a sustainable approach. Rather than tearing down old structures, which often results in waste and environmental harm, renovation allows cities to make use of existing resources. Restoring buildings reduces the need for new materials, thus minimizing the environmental impact of construction. The restoration of Detroit's historic sites is a notable example, demonstrating both economic benefits and environmental awareness.Preserving historic buildings also strengthens community bonds. These structures often serve as landmarks for community events or evoke fond memories for residents. By maintaining these buildings, cities promote a sense of belonging and pride among their inhabitants, fostering social unity.On the other hand, advocates of modern constructions argue that contemporary architecture meets current needs and reflects modern lifestyles. However, it often lacks the charm and character of historic buildings, appearing cold and uninviting, and failing to inspire the same level of attachment and admiration.In conclusion, cities should give priority to preserving their historic buildings. This approach safeguards cultural heritage, promotes sustainable practices, and reinforces community ties, ensuring the stories of the past continue to enrich the lives of citizens.
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;The idea that parents are the best teachers has some validity, but I disagree that they are the sole or always the most effective educators. Education is a complex process that involves multiple factors, including the influence of teachers, mentors, and external experiences, all of which play a significant role in a child's overall development.Initially, parents are indeed a child's first and most significant teachers, providing essential knowledge and life skills. They nurture emotional intelligence, social abilities, and moral principles that are vital for navigating daily life. For example, by instructing children in sharing, empathy, and communication, parents establish the foundation for successful social interactions. A child who feels supported at home is more likely to develop healthy relationships outside the family.However, as children mature, their educational needs change. Formal education providers, such as teachers, offer specialized knowledge and expertise that may not be within a parent's skill set. Certain subjects like mathematics, science, and history require a level of specialization that often surpasses a parent's capabilities. For instance, a child may struggle with intricate mathematical concepts that a trained educator can explain more effectively. Furthermore, teachers are adept in various educational strategies that can accommodate diverse learning styles, which may be challenging for a parent to provide, despite their best intentions and love.Moreover, interactions with peers and experiences outside the home environment contribute significantly to a child's educational growth. Schools provide settings where children learn to work together, resolve conflicts, and adapt to various social situations. These interactions are unique to the school environment and cannot be fully replicated within the family setting.In conclusion, while parents undoubtedly play a vital role in teaching fundamental values and skills, they are not necessarily the best educators for every aspect of a child's education. A balanced approach that combines parental guidance with professional education leads to a more comprehensive and effective learning experience.
323;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task.;"In my family, the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father's job. Five years ago, he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer, and became a landscape painter. Every time I asked him why, he will say, seriously,"" I am done, doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different, that is all."" While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job, but from my perspective, I am on the side of my father.Most of workers have adapted to do same task. It allows us to achieve more. As a authoritative dentist in my province, my mother has worked for 25 years. Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India, finally he became the father of the nation. These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time. While when it comes to ""happier"", different type of jobs can be responsible factor.Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier. Workers, who work for an ordinary company or industry, will be sick of same tasks day by day. Although they can be familiar with their job, changing of job is what serve to their happier. Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment, which, according to psychology theories, makes workers relaxed and happier. To set another example, consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work, employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits. They both will be happy because the change of job, not the same task day by day.Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges, making life colorful. Just like a song, if I did not have challenge, life would be blue. As an engineering researcher, I will surely be disappointed for failure, and exited for new challenges. New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works, it also means through dealing with it, I will obtain more knowledge and experience. As the saying of a Chinese writer, the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf, but rather there always exists new things and challenge. After all, doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden, connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life.To sum up, I admire my father's choice, while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert, like my mom, I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life.";The notion that employees experience greater happiness when performing a variety of tasks during their workday, as opposed to repeating the same task, is a sentiment that strongly resonates in the diverse work environments of today. I firmly endorse this statement, as engaging in diverse tasks not only increases job satisfaction but also drives productivity and creativity.Primarily, undertaking a range of tasks can help prevent monotony. The repetition of tasks can lead to boredom, diminishing motivation and a sense of purpose in the workplace. In contrast, when employees participate in diverse activities, they remain mentally stimulated, often experiencing renewed energy and enthusiasm for their work. For example, an individual who alternates between administrative tasks, client interactions, and project planning is likely to feel a sense of accomplishment from overcoming the varied challenges they encounter, thereby greatly enhancing their overall happiness.Furthermore, diverse tasks cultivate a broad range of skills. Employees exposed to various tasks often acquire new skills and competencies, leading to personal and professional growth. This continuous learning fosters a dynamic workplace where employees feel valued and appreciated for their contributions. Research in organizational psychology has demonstrated that employees engaging in a range of tasks exhibit higher levels of engagement and commitment to their organizations.Additionally, the opportunity to collaborate with different teams or departments is another advantage of diverse task assignments. Such interactions can foster a sense of community and belonging, both of which are crucial for employee satisfaction. When employees feel connected to their colleagues through collaborative efforts, it creates a supportive work culture that further enhances happiness.In conclusion, participating in diverse tasks throughout the workday results in a more fulfilling and enjoyable work experience. By mitigating monotony, promoting skill development, and fostering collaboration, diverse tasks significantly contribute to employee happiness and overall productivity in the workplace.
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;In today's fast-paced work environment, the capacity to adapt to new situations has become a key determinant of success, often surpassing the importance of having in-depth knowledge of a specific job. Although technical expertise and skills are essential, adaptability plays a critical role in navigating the constant changes that occur in any workplace.The modern job market is marked by frequent transformations in technology, organizational structures, and processes, which demands that employees be able to respond to unexpected challenges and swiftly learn new systems or practices. Individuals who can rapidly adjust their approach and mindset are more likely to excel in such environments. For example, a program manager who excels in project planning but is inflexible when faced with changes in project scope or team dynamics may struggle. Adaptability, therefore, enables individuals to remain effective even in the face of uncertainty.Furthermore, the contemporary workplace increasingly values collaboration and teamwork, emphasizing the importance of interpersonal skills and the ability to work effectively with diverse colleagues. Being able to build strong relationships and communicate effectively with others can be more valuable than technical expertise alone. When employees demonstrate a willingness to learn from their colleagues and an openness to new ideas, they can harness the collective strengths of their team, driving innovation and project success.On the other hand, an employee with extensive job-specific knowledge who resists change may find it challenging to thrive in a dynamic environment. This inflexibility not only hinders personal growth but can also impede the team's progress. In summary, while having excellent knowledge of a job is undeniably crucial, the ability to adapt to changing environments is essential in the contemporary, ever-evolving workspace. By embracing adaptability, individuals can grow, collaborate, and flourish amidst change, ultimately achieving greater career success.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;The introduction of computers has undoubtedly revolutionized our daily lives, prompting a discussion about their impact on simplicity and stress levels. In my view, although computers provide numerous benefits, they also bring about layers of complexity that can lead to increased stress.On one hand, computers have made various everyday tasks more straightforward. The internet, for example, provides instant access to a vast array of information, allowing individuals to acquire knowledge on almost any subject in a matter of seconds. Online banking, e-commerce, and remote work have also simplified transactions and enabled greater flexibility, permitting users to manage their finances, shop, and work from the comfort of their own homes, thus achieving a better balance between work and personal life.However, alongside these benefits, computers can also generate complexity and stress. The sheer volume of online information can be overwhelming, resulting in information overload and making it challenging to identify trustworthy sources. Furthermore, the constant availability through emails, social media, and notifications keeps individuals in a state of continuous alertness, making it difficult to distinguish between personal and professional life. This can ultimately lead to burnout and anxiety, as individuals feel pressured to be constantly available and responsive.Additionally, the rapid pace of technological advancements can leave some individuals struggling to keep up, leading to feelings of inadequacy and frustration. For instance, many older adults may find the transition to computer use particularly challenging, resulting in a sense of isolation from the increasingly digital world.In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly enhanced convenience and efficiency in numerous aspects of life, they have also introduced a range of complexities and stressors. To fully reap the benefits of technology, it is essential for society to strike a balance that allows for both productivity and well-being, fostering a healthier relationship with computers.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;I wholeheartedly endorse the idea that foreign language instruction should commence as soon as children enter school. Introducing children to foreign languages at an early age has a profound impact on their cognitive development, cultural awareness, and future prospects.The primary advantage of early language learning lies in its ability to capitalize on children's natural aptitude for absorbing new information. Scientific studies have demonstrated that the young mind is exceptionally malleable, facilitating the acquisition of novel sounds, vocabulary, and grammatical structures. A notable example of this is the ability of young children to attain native-like pronunciation when exposed to a foreign language from an early age, a benefit that tends to diminish as they get older. By incorporating language instruction into their educational curriculum from the outset, children can cultivate a deeper linguistic intuition and proficiency.Furthermore, acquiring a foreign language broadens cultural understanding and fosters empathy. In today's interconnected world, cultural sensitivity is essential. When children learn a foreign language, they acquire not only a means of communication but also gain valuable insights into the associated culture. For instance, a student learning Spanish may explore the vibrant traditions of Spanish-speaking countries, promoting respect and appreciation for diversity. This cultural exposure can help break down stereotypes and promote inclusivity, ultimately contributing to a more harmonious society.Additionally, being proficient in multiple languages can significantly enhance future academic and professional opportunities. In a highly competitive job market, employers often prioritize candidates with language skills. For example, a student proficient in Mandarin may have a competitive edge in business sectors that trade with China. By introducing language education early on, schools are providing students with skills that will prove invaluable throughout their lives.In conclusion, introducing foreign language learning in early education lays the groundwork for cognitive benefits, cultural awareness, and improved career prospects. Given these compelling arguments, it is clear that foreign language acquisition should be a fundamental component of every child's educational journey.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;The discussion surrounding the separation of boys and girls in educational institutions sparks crucial conversations about education, gender roles, and societal expectations. I vehemently oppose the idea of segregating boys and girls into different schools. Educational settings that include both genders provide numerous benefits, including enhanced academic achievement and preparation for real-world interactions.Primarily, coeducational environments promote mutual understanding and respect between boys and girls. By attending the same school, students of different genders develop essential collaboration and communication skills, which are vital in academic and professional settings. For example, group projects that require diverse perspectives thrive in coeducational settings, as students learn from one another's unique viewpoints and develop innovative problem-solving skills.Furthermore, coeducation helps dismantle harmful gender stereotypes that often emerge in single-gender classrooms. In these environments, boys may feel pressured to conform to traditional masculine norms, suppressing emotional expression, while girls may be steered towards narrow, gender-specific roles. In contrast, coeducational settings encourage students to look beyond these stereotypes, fostering an environment where individual talents and interests can flourish, unrestricted by gender expectations. This allows students to pursue their passions, regardless of whether they align with traditional gender roles - a boy can excel in drama, and a girl can thrive in science, without facing societal pressure to conform.Additionally, research suggests that the perceived academic benefits of single-gender education, such as reduced distractions or increased confidence, do not translate to improved long-term educational outcomes. In fact, coeducational systems have proven to be equally, if not more, effective in producing academically successful students.In conclusion, I strongly advocate for boys and girls to attend the same schools. Coeducational environments enrich the educational experience, foster respect and understanding between genders, and prepare students for a diverse, inclusive society. By promoting coeducation, we can create a more balanced and harmonious future, where students can grow, learn, and thrive together.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";"Achieving success is a complex and multifaceted process that can be accomplished through different approaches, with two main philosophies emerging: the importance of risk-taking and the value of meticulous planning. In my view, the most effective way to attain genuine success is by combining these two approaches, as they mutually enhance and support each other.On the one hand, taking risks is often a crucial factor in achieving growth and seizing opportunities. Many highly successful individuals, such as entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and athletes like Michael Jordan, have achieved greatness by venturing out of their comfort zones. A notable example is J.K. Rowling, who faced numerous rejections before her book ""Harry Potter"" became a publishing sensation. Her willingness to take risks and accept potential failure ultimately led to enormous success, demonstrating how embracing uncertainty can lead to extraordinary opportunities that might not be discovered through careful planning alone.On the other hand, while taking risks can lead to remarkable outcomes, it is equally important to have a solid plan in place. Careful planning provides a framework that guides individuals through their pursuits. For instance, launching a new business requires not only the courage to start, but also the strategic foresight to develop a business model, conduct market research, and create a marketing strategy. A well-thought-out plan minimizes the consequences of potential failures by preparing individuals for possible challenges, thereby increasing the likelihood of success.In conclusion, the most effective approach to success is a balanced combination of risk-taking and careful planning. While taking risks can lead to unprecedented achievements, a strategic plan helps navigate life's complexities. Ultimately, those who skillfully integrate these elements are most likely to achieve success."
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";I strongly believe in the importance of occasionally participating in activities that don't bring us joy. While pursuing our passions and interests is vital for happiness, there are numerous benefits to be gained from venturing out of our comfort zones and tackling unpleasant tasks.One of the primary advantages of engaging in unenjoyable activities is the potential for personal growth. Many individuals find themselves in careers that require them to develop skills outside their areas of expertise. Although tasks like public speaking or financial analysis may not be enjoyable, they contribute significantly to overall skill development. By confronting these challenges, individuals can enhance their abilities, paving the way for career advancement and potentially discovering new passions. For instance, someone who dislikes writing may discover that composing an essay greatly improves their communication skills, benefiting both their personal and professional life.Furthermore, participating in activities we don't enjoy can cultivate a sense of responsibility and accountability. Life is replete with obligations, including household chores, professional duties, and social commitments. A student, for example, may not enjoy attending a particular class, but recognizes the importance of education and attends nonetheless. By doing so, they acquire knowledge, discipline, and the skills necessary to tackle future challenges. Embracing responsibility helps build character and fosters traits like perseverance and resilience.In addition, engaging in unenjoyable tasks can deepen relationships. Social interactions often involve compromises, such as spending time with friends or family during activities that don't particularly interest us. However, these efforts can strengthen bonds, demonstrating our commitment to nurturing relationships even when it requires personal sacrifice.In conclusion, while engaging in enjoyable activities is essential for personal fulfillment, participating in tasks we don't enjoy plays a critical role in personal growth, responsibility, and relationship-building. Striking a balance between these two types of activities is crucial for a well-rounded and fulfilling life.
330;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homesÊ;The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance. Therefore, government should spend money on preservation of old buildings.;The question of whether governments should allocate funds to new construction projects rather than preserving historic buildings is a multifaceted and intricate issue. In my opinion, prioritizing new constructions over the preservation of traditional structures is misguided. Preserving historic buildings is essential for maintaining cultural identity, fostering community pride, and promoting environmentally friendly urban development.Historic buildings are a physical connection to our past, recounting stories of architectural styles, societal values, and significant events that have shaped our communities. By preserving these structures, governments honor the accomplishments and struggles of previous generations and provide future generations with a sense of continuity and belonging. The unique character of a city, often rooted in its historic architecture, influences the quality of life for residents and the perceptions of tourists.Moreover, investing in preservation can have economic benefits. Historic buildings can attract tourists, generating revenue for local businesses and creating jobs. In cities famous for their historic structures, the tourism industry thrives, boosting the economy. Additionally, restoring and repurposing old buildings is often a more sustainable option than constructing new ones, as it reduces waste and conserves materials, aligning with contemporary environmental objectives.Furthermore, while new constructions can bring benefits, they can also lead to a loss of community character and the displacement of long-time residents. Urban development often prioritizes profit over community needs, resulting in the construction of homogenous buildings lacking cultural significance. In contrast, preserving historic buildings maintains the unique identities of neighborhoods and fosters community cohesion.In conclusion, although new constructions can contribute to progress, preserving historic structures is essential for safeguarding our cultural heritage. By prioritizing both new constructions and preservation, governments can create vibrant, diverse, and sustainable communities that celebrate their past while building a bright future.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;The period of transition from adolescence to adulthood is a pivotal phase in a person's life, marked by a desire for either independence or a preference to stay with family. Although both options have their advantages, I firmly believe that young adults who strive for independence as soon as possible are more likely to acquire vital life skills and experience personal growth compared to those who opt to live with their parents for an extended duration.One of the significant advantages of achieving independence early on is the chance for self-discovery. When young adults start living on their own, they are compelled to manage daily tasks such as handling finances, cooking, and maintaining a household, which helps develop problem-solving and decision-making abilities - essential components of personal growth. For example, a young adult living independently learns to manage their expenses, acquiring financial literacy that will benefit them throughout their life.Furthermore, living independently fosters resilience and adaptability. Young adults must confront challenges without relying on their family, which cultivates a sense of responsibility and confidence. Overcoming obstacles such as a tough job market or unexpected bills can teach valuable lessons about perseverance and resourcefulness, ultimately contributing to character development and preparing individuals for adulthood's complexities.On the other hand, staying at home may offer comfort and security, but it can also limit personal growth and encourage dependency. Young adults who live with their parents may miss out on essential experiences that help them develop autonomy. Research indicates that delaying independence can lead to struggles with workplace challenges or personal relationships due to a lack of practical experience.In conclusion, pursuing independence at a young age provides individuals with the necessary tools to succeed in adulthood. The skills and confidence gained from navigating life's challenges independently can lead to greater success and fulfillment in the long term. Therefore, I believe that young adults should strive for independence sooner rather than later, as it is the more beneficial option.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way people interact with one another, resulting in significant changes to their relationships. The widespread adoption of social media, instant messaging, and video conferencing has made communication instantaneous and accessible to a global audience. This shift has yielded both beneficial and detrimental effects on the relationships people form.A notable outcome of this evolution is the rise of virtual friendships. Social media has enabled individuals to connect with like-minded people across the globe, fostering relationships based on shared interests rather than physical proximity. This has led to a democratization of relationships, providing individuals with diverse support networks and promoting inclusivity. However, the proliferation of technology has also led to the proliferation of superficial relationships. Many online relationships lack the emotional depth and authenticity that comes with in-person interactions. The prevalence of online personas can lead to misunderstandings, as nuances of human emotion are often lost in digital communication. This raises concerns about the quality of relationships and individual well-being in the digital age.Furthermore, the constant connectedness provided by technology can paradoxically lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Despite having numerous online connections, these often fail to translate into meaningful relationships. The pressure to maintain a virtual presence can also detract from real-life relationships, with individuals prioritizing online engagement over quality time with friends and family.In conclusion, technology has undoubtedly altered the fabric of interpersonal relationships, allowing for broader connections while raising concerns about depth and authenticity. To maximize the benefits of technology while minimizing its drawbacks, individuals must strive to strike a balance between digital interactions and genuine, face-to-face relationships, ensuring that technology serves as a facilitator rather than a hindrance.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The growing presence of technology in our daily lives has sparked a profound shift, where machines are now assuming responsibilities that were previously exclusive to human workers. This phenomenon has both beneficial and detrimental consequences, warranting a closer examination.The advantages of automation are noteworthy, as it can substantially enhance efficiency and productivity. Machines are capable of working tirelessly, executing repetitive tasks with greater speed and accuracy than humans. For example, in the manufacturing sector, robots can assemble products with a speed and precision that surpasses human capabilities. This reduction in production time, combined with a decrease in human error, results in higher quality outputs. Additionally, automation can liberate human workers from mundane and physically demanding tasks, enabling them to focus on more intricate and creative responsibilities that demand critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.However, the increasing role of machines also has significant drawbacks, particularly concerning employment. As machines assume tasks traditionally performed by humans, there is a growing apprehension about job displacement. Skilled workers may find themselves at risk of redundancy, contributing to increased unemployment rates and a widening economic disparity. Furthermore, the transition to a more automated workforce can generate anxiety and resistance among employees, who may be concerned that they lack the necessary skills to adapt to advancing technology.Moreover, an over-reliance on machines may lead to a decline in essential human skills. As individuals become increasingly dependent on technology, there is a risk that fundamental skills, such as problem-solving and interpersonal communication, may deteriorate over time.In conclusion, while the automation of work presents significant benefits in terms of efficiency and productivity, it also raises pressing concerns regarding job security and skill retention. Striking a balance between these contrasting aspects will be crucial as society navigates this transformative era of technological advancement.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;Over the past twenty years, the rapid progression of information technology (IT) has drastically altered the manner in which we interact, acquire knowledge, and engage in commercial activities. The emergence of innovations such as the World Wide Web and electronic mail has facilitated unparalleled connectivity and accessibility to information. Nevertheless, as we gaze into the future, a growing apprehension exists that the evolution of IT may yield more detrimental effects than beneficial ones.A paramount concern is the issue of privacy. The widespread adoption of data-driven technologies has rendered individuals' personal information increasingly vulnerable. The escalation of cybersecurity threats, including data infringements and identity theft, has left numerous individuals susceptible. As technological advancements persist, the potential for the misuse of personal data may precipitate broader societal issues, encompassing harassment, discrimination, and concerns pertaining to personal safety.Moreover, the ascendancy of artificial intelligence (AI), while proffering enhanced efficiency and innovation, poses risks associated with job displacement. As automation supplants tasks traditionally executed by humans, numerous workers encounter unemployment or the necessity to retrain for novel roles. This socioeconomic shift may exacerbate existing inequalities, precipitating further division within society between those capable of adapting to novel technologies and those who are not.Additionally, social media platforms, which have revolutionized communication, frequently disseminate misinformation and contribute to societal polarization. The capacity to rapidly disseminate false information can have calamitous consequences for public health, democratic processes, and social cohesion.On the other hand, technological advancements undoubtedly bring numerous benefits, including enhanced healthcare, augmented learning opportunities, and increased global collaboration. However, as we contemplate future developments in IT, it is essential to acknowledge that these potential benefits are accompanied by significant risks. Establishing a balance between embracing innovation and implementing robust safeguards will be vital in ensuring that future advancements do not precipitate more harm than benefit.In conclusion, while the evolution of IT has provided vast improvements to our daily existence, the looming challenges related to privacy, employment, and social dynamics evoke concern. Therefore, it is reasonable to assert that unless prudent measures are undertaken, future developments in IT could indeed yield more negative consequences than positive outcomes. 
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;The impact of celebrity media coverage on children has become a highly debated topic in recent years. Although some people may think that this type of media coverage is harmless or even positive, I strongly believe that the constant attention given to celebrity culture has a negative impact on children's development and self-image.The persistent exposure to the luxurious and glamorous lifestyles of celebrities can alter a child's perception of success and happiness. Celebrities often showcase lives of extravagance, beauty, and wealth, creating unrealistic expectations for children. This can lead children to believe that their worth is tied to their appearance and material possessions, resulting in issues such as low self-esteem and body image problems. Young children are particularly susceptible to these influences, and without proper guidance, the values promoted by celebrity culture can overshadow more important values like kindness, hard work, and authenticity.Furthermore, the intense media scrutiny of celebrities often glorifies negative behaviors like substance abuse, promiscuity, and aggression. When children idolize celebrities who exhibit these behaviors, they may mistakenly view them as acceptable or even desirable. This normalization of negative behaviors can lead to poor decision-making and unhealthy lifestyle choices. Additionally, the obsession with celebrity gossip can foster a culture of bullying and shaming, where children feel pressured to conform to peer expectations, just like they see celebrities navigating their lives.In summary, while celebrity media culture may provide entertainment, its widespread influence can be detrimental to children's development. It creates unrealistic expectations and promotes negative behavioral norms that can have lasting effects on young individuals. Therefore, it is essential for parents and guardians to have thoughtful discussions with children about the reality of celebrity culture and encourage them to follow healthier, more positive role models.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";The influence of technology, especially mobile phones, on social interactions has sparked a significant amount of debate. Although some people believe that mobile devices erode face-to-face communication, I firmly believe that they can actually strengthen social bonds rather than weaken them.To begin with, mobile phones act as a conduit for communication, enabling people to stay connected regardless of physical distance. Families that are separated by vast distances can instantly share moments through messaging, phone calls, or video conferencing, which fosters a sense of closeness that would be challenging to achieve otherwise. For example, a student studying in a foreign country can maintain frequent contact with loved ones back home, thereby enriching their personal connections despite the physical distance between them.Furthermore, mobile technology facilitates the creation of new social connections. Social media platforms, which can be accessed via mobile devices, allow users to meet and engage with individuals who share similar interests, hobbies, or goals. These virtual interactions can lead to in-person meetups and friendships, significantly broadening one's social network. In this regard, mobile phones can actually enhance social interaction by introducing users to diverse perspectives and life experiences, rather than diminishing it.However, it's essential to acknowledge the potential downsides of excessive mobile phone usage. The appeal of virtual communication can lead to a decline in face-to-face interactions, which can result in shallow connections. People can become so engrossed in their screens that they miss out on opportunities for meaningful interactions with the people in their immediate surroundings. This concern emphasizes the importance of striking a balance between technology usage and in-person interactions.In conclusion, although mobile phones can be a distraction from in-person communication, they can ultimately serve as powerful tools for enhancing social interactions. When used judiciously, mobile devices can strengthen existing relationships, foster new ones, and create a more interconnected world. The key to maximizing the benefits of mobile technology lies in finding a balance between digital and physical interactions, ensuring that technology complements rather than detracts from our social lives.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;The advent of modern communication technologies, such as email and messaging apps, has revolutionized the way we connect with others in today's technologically driven world. Although these tools provide unparalleled convenience and efficiency in staying in touch, I firmly believe that they have had a profound impact on the quality of our social interactions, leading to a decline in meaningful relationships and a reduction in face-to-face interactions with friends.One of the primary concerns is that the instantaneity of messaging platforms can lead to shallow and superficial exchanges. The lack of nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone, in text-based communication can result in a lack of emotional depth and nuance, ultimately leading to weaker connections. While these tools enable us to maintain a larger social circle, the relationships we foster through them tend to be more superficial. As a consequence, individuals may find themselves engaging in fleeting conversations rather than cultivating profound and enduring friendships.Furthermore, the ease and convenience of digital communication can breed complacency, causing individuals to neglect the importance of in-person interactions. The simplicity of sending a text message can discourage people from making an effort to meet in person, resulting in a decline in the number of social gatherings and face-to-face interactions. Many friends may opt for the convenience of virtual communication over the richness of in-person experiences, ultimately leading to a decline in the quality of their relationships.Another negative consequence of modern communication technologies is the tendency for people to substitute online interactions for real-life experiences. Social media platforms can create a false sense of connection, where individuals feel they are socializing while, in reality, they are isolating themselves by spending hours scrolling through feeds instead of engaging with friends and family. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, as individuals may be surrounded by a virtual community yet lack the intimacy and depth that comes from shared experiences and in-person connections.In conclusion, while modern communication methods have their benefits, they have significantly reduced the time people spend with friends and, subsequently, the quality of social interactions. I firmly agree that these changes have had a detrimental impact on our social lives, highlighting the importance of maintaining in-person connections and nurturing deeper, more meaningful relationships through face-to-face interactions.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";The discussion about whether competition or cooperation should be prioritized in the development of children is multifaceted, with compelling arguments on both sides. Those who support promoting competition among children contend that it helps them develop vital life skills, including perseverance, ambition, and a drive for excellence. Being in competitive environments motivates children to give their best effort, which in turn improves their abilities and helps them achieve their objectives. For example, competition in sports encourages teamwork, discipline, and setting personal goals, all of which contribute to building character and preparing children for the inevitable competitive aspects of life.In contrast, advocates for cooperation argue that teaching children to work together promotes essential skills such as empathy, social interaction, and problem-solving, all of which are crucial in today's interconnected world. Through cooperative activities, children learn to appreciate different viewpoints, build strong relationships, and strive for shared objectives. In an era where global challenges like climate change and public health issues require collective efforts, the ability to cooperate and communicate effectively is vital. Children who learn to collaborate tend to be more adaptable and better equipped to navigate complex social situations as adults.In summary, although competition can fuel personal growth and achievement, an environment that encourages cooperation provides children with vital interpersonal skills. A balanced approach that combines elements of both competition and cooperation may be the most beneficial. This approach enables children to develop the resilience needed to overcome challenges while also understanding the value of working together. Ultimately, fostering both competitive and cooperative qualities helps shape well-rounded individuals who can succeed in a competitive environment while appreciating the importance of collaboration for collective success.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;The rapid advancement of technology in recent years has revolutionized the way people interact and form connections with one another. Social media platforms, instant messaging apps, and other digital tools have transformed the communication landscape, presenting both benefits and drawbacks for interpersonal relationships.One of the most significant effects of technology is its ability to facilitate long-distance relationships. With the help of platforms like Zoom and WhatsApp, individuals can now maintain relationships across vast distances, fostering connections that were previously unimaginable. Online dating apps have also changed the dating landscape, allowing people to connect with potential partners from diverse backgrounds, leading to more intercultural relationships.However, the shift towards digital communication has also had negative consequences for interpersonal relationships. Many people feel isolated despite being constantly connected online, and the preference for texting over in-person interactions can hinder the development of deeper emotional connections. The loss of non-verbal cues, which are essential for understanding each other, can lead to misunderstandings and shallow relationships. Furthermore, the curated nature of social media profiles can create unrealistic expectations and promote comparisons, resulting in feelings of inadequacy among users.In conclusion, technology has a double-edged impact on relationships. On one hand, it has expanded opportunities for connection and interaction across different backgrounds. On the other hand, it risks diminishing the depth of those connections and promoting superficial engagements. It is essential to balance the benefits and drawbacks of technology in our relationships. The impact of technology on interpersonal relationships ultimately depends on how it is used, and it can either lead to more meaningful connections or a decline in the quality of interactions.
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;The notion that technological progress inevitably leads to the decline of traditional skills and ways of life is a multifaceted issue that requires thoughtful examination. Although modernization can pose challenges to traditional practices, it is an oversimplification to consider the preservation of these practices as unnecessary.On the one hand, advocates of technology contend that innovation yields greater efficiency and an improved quality of life. For example, the automation of agricultural processes can result in higher crop yields and reduced manual labor, which may seem to render traditional farming methods obsolete. Nevertheless, this viewpoint neglects the intrinsic value of these skills, which often possess significant cultural importance and are deeply intertwined with the identity of a community. Numerous societies rely on these practices not only for sustenance but also as a means to preserve their heritage and social cohesion.However, the interplay between technology and tradition does not necessarily have to be a zero-sum proposition. In reality, many cultures are discovering ways to merge modern technology with traditional practices, thereby creating a harmonious blend of the two. For instance, farmers may utilize cutting-edge agricultural tools in conjunction with organic methods that have been passed down through generations, thus enhancing productivity while preserving the cultural characteristics that define a community.Furthermore, as the global community confronts pressing challenges such as climate change, there is a growing recognition of the value of sustainable practices that are often inherent to traditional lifestyles. Communities are increasingly placing a high value on indigenous knowledge systems that have endured for centuries, and are seeking ways to balance modern innovations with time-tested techniques that are environmentally sound.In conclusion, while technology undoubtedly transforms societies, the complete abandonment of traditional skills and ways of life is neither unavoidable nor desirable. Rather than viewing them as relics of the past, acknowledging their relevance and adaptability in the modern world can lead to a more harmonious coexistence of traditional and modern practices.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;The discussion around whether competition or cooperation is more advantageous for children's development is multifaceted. Proponents of competition argue that it cultivates resilience, ambition, and a drive for excellence in children. Participating in competitive activities such as sports, academic competitions, and performance-based events can give children a sense of accomplishment and teach them to cope with success and failure. The experience of competing also fosters personal growth, as children aim to enhance their skills, set objectives, and strive to achieve them. Moreover, a competitive environment simulates real-life scenarios where individuals often compete for limited resources, thus preparing them for the challenges of adulthood.On the other hand, advocates of cooperation believe that collaborative work instills vital life skills such as teamwork, empathy, and communication. In today's globalized world, the ability to cooperate effectively with others is vital for success in various domains, from corporate settings to community projects. Supporters of cooperation argue that when children are taught to prioritize collaboration, they are more likely to make positive contributions to society as adults. They believe that cooperation promotes inclusivity, reduces feelings of isolation, and minimizes the negative impacts of competitive pressures.In my view, both competition and cooperation have their advantages. A balanced approach, which combines the benefits of both, seems to be the most effective strategy. Fostering a healthy sense of competition can motivate children to strive for personal excellence, while teaching cooperation equips them with the essential social skills necessary for collaborative success in adulthood. Ideally, educational frameworks should incorporate opportunities that allow children to learn from competition while emphasizing the value of teamwork and collective goal-achievement. By striking this balance, children will be well-prepared to navigate the complexities of adult life, becoming both capable and cooperative individuals.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;The omnipresence of advertising in modern society is undeniable, exerting a profound influence on consumer behavior, public perception, and cultural standards. Nevertheless, the question of whether advertising yields more detrimental than beneficial effects is a complex and multifaceted issue, with compelling arguments presented by both proponents and critics.On one hand, advocates of advertising assert that it fulfills several vital functions. Primarily, it enlightens consumers about novel products and services, thereby facilitating informed decision-making. Through advertising, the public can be educated about groundbreaking technologies, health products, and other essential offerings. Secondly, advertising can stimulate competition among businesses, resulting in enhanced product and service quality at competitive pricing. Additionally, advertising constitutes a significant revenue stream for diverse media platforms, facilitating the creation of varied content and contributing to economic expansion.On the other hand, detractors argue that advertising frequently perpetuates consumerism and materialism, leading to adverse social repercussions. It can foster unrealistic aspirations and desires, culminating in dissatisfaction with one's life circumstances and possessions. For example, advertisements often portray idealized lifestyles that are unattainable for many individuals, instilling feelings of inadequacy and diminished self-esteem. Furthermore, ethical concerns surround advertising practices, particularly with regards to targeted marketing towards susceptible populations, such as children. Such tactics can manipulate impressionable minds, potentially leading to unhealthy habits, including poor dietary choices or substance abuse.In conclusion, while acknowledging the merits of advertising in terms of economic benefits and consumer information, it is imperative not to overlook the potential for harm, particularly in the domains of mental health and societal values. Establishing regulatory frameworks to ensure ethical advertising practices that prioritize consumer well-being over profit is essential. Striking a balance between the benefits of advertising and its potential negative consequences is crucial for fostering a more informed, healthier, and more conscious society.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";The income disparity among contemporary artists is a multifaceted issue that mirrors the values and market forces of the broader society. The significant disparity in earnings between artists who receive high prices for their work and those who struggle to make a living in a highly competitive environment raises concerns about fairness and long-term viability in the art world. This has led to discussions about the need for government involvement in addressing these discrepancies.The art market is, on the one hand, subject to the influences of trends, demand, and speculation, with high-profile auctions frequently resulting in exceptionally high prices that benefit only a small number of artists. This creates the perception that talent is the sole determinant of success, while many other equally skilled and passionate artists face difficulties in gaining recognition or financial support. The existence of such disparities within the art community appears to be unfair, especially given the essential role of creative expression in cultural and social dialogue.On the other hand, it can be argued that the art market, like any other market, functions optimally when driven by the forces of supply and demand. Government interference could potentially disrupt the natural flow of artistic expression and the process of valuation. Furthermore, direct government intervention might unintentionally stifle creativity, leading to a uniform model that fails to acknowledge the unique contributions of individual artists.However, I am of the opinion that there is a significant role for the government to play in reducing these disparities. Initiatives such as grants, subsidies, tax incentives for emerging artists, and funding for art education could improve opportunities for those who are struggling financially. By investing more broadly in the arts, governments can promote a diverse range of artistic voices and ensure a healthier environment for all creators.In conclusion, while the art market is inherently unpredictable, government action can provide a necessary balance to ensure equal opportunities for artists at all levels. By addressing the inequities in artistic compensation, we can foster a richer cultural landscape that values and elevates the contributions of every artist, ultimately leading to a more diverse and vibrant artistic community.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";The trend of working longer hours has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, with many individuals dedicating more time to their jobs than ever before. Although some argue that this increased work ethic can lead to heightened productivity and economic growth, I firmly believe that the drawbacks of excessive work hours outweigh any potential advantages. The far-reaching consequences of prolonged working hours affect not only individuals but also their families and society as a whole, underscoring the necessity of implementing restrictions on working hours.The primary concern is that working excessively long hours can have a profound impact on an individual's health and well-being. Prolonged overwork has been linked to various health issues, including stress, anxiety, and cardiovascular diseases. The relentless exhaustion of employees leads to compromised physical and mental health, resulting in decreased productivity and increased absenteeism. This, in turn, places an additional burden on healthcare systems, highlighting the broader societal implications of excessive work.Furthermore, lengthy working hours can put a strain on family relationships. Individuals who devote excessive time to their jobs often miss crucial family events and struggle to maintain meaningful connections with their loved ones. This disconnection can lead to the deterioration of family bonds and contribute to issues such as neglect or increased conflict within the family unit. As a result, the fabric of society begins to deteriorate, as strong family units are vital for nurturing future generations.Additionally, the pressure to work long hours perpetuates a culture that glorifies busyness and overachievement, which can create a cycle of unhappiness and dissatisfaction. By introducing restrictions on working hours, we can promote a healthier work-life balance that enhances overall quality of life, strengthens familial connections, and positively contributes to society at large.In conclusion, the adverse effects of prolonged working hours on individuals, families, and society cannot be overstated. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the implementation of restrictions on working hours to ensure a healthier, more balanced, and ultimately more effective workforce.
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;The concept of success is frequently associated with financial wealth, but this perspective oversimplifies a multifaceted concept. Financial achievement can be an indicator of success, but it is not the only factor to consider. Success is a highly subjective and complex concept that encompasses various aspects. For individuals in professions such as teaching, social work, or healthcare, success may be defined by the positive impact they have on others' lives, rather than their financial earnings. These individuals often work long hours for relatively low salaries, yet their contributions to society are invaluable, and their success is measured by the positive change they create.Moreover, personal fulfillment and the achievement of life goals play a crucial role in defining success. An individual may be content with their simple lifestyle, prioritizing time with family and friends, pursuing hobbies, and nurturing meaningful relationships. These elements contribute to a person's overall happiness and life satisfaction, which can be considered true success. In contrast, a wealthy individual who lacks personal connections and happiness may feel unfulfilled despite their financial status.The pursuit of wealth can also lead to negative consequences, such as increased stress, unhealthy competition, and ethical dilemmas. Equating success solely with financial wealth can inadvertently promote a culture that prioritizes financial gain over integrity, creativity, and emotional well-being.In conclusion, while financial success is important for many, it is not the sole measure of a successful person. Success should encompass a broader range of factors, including personal growth, impact on society, and overall happiness. True success is a balance between wealth, fulfillment, and contributing positively to the world, and it is this harmonious balance that ultimately defines a successful person.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;The idea that high sales of popular consumer products are mainly due to the influence of advertising, rather than actual societal needs, requires a detailed examination of consumer behavior and the factors that influence purchasing decisions. Although it is clear that advertising plays a crucial role in driving consumer sales, it is overly simplistic to ignore the underlying societal needs that also drive these purchases.Firstly, advertising has a significant impact on consumer choices. Advertisers use various channels, including television, social media, print, and experiential marketing, to create narratives that resonate with consumers' emotions, aspirations, and lifestyles. Effective advertising campaigns can create a perceived need for a product, making it seem essential for daily life or social status. For example, smartphone manufacturers often market their products as necessities, suggesting that owning the latest model is vital for social acceptance and success. This can lead to increased sales, often beyond what is actually necessary.However, it is also important to acknowledge that consumption is not solely driven by advertising. Many purchases are based on real needs, which are influenced by factors such as economic conditions, cultural shifts, and technological advancements. For instance, the growing sales of electric vehicles reflect a societal shift towards sustainability, driven not only by aggressive marketing but also by a growing public awareness of climate change and the desire for environmentally friendly transportation. In this context, consumer goods often meet tangible needs that align with societal values, rather than being merely the result of effective advertising.In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly amplifies sales through its persuasive power, it works in conjunction with genuine societal needs that shape consumer behavior. A balanced perspective recognizes the interplay between marketing influence and the actual demands of society, illustrating that high sales can reflect both the power of advertising and an evolving understanding of consumer necessities. 
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;The connection between taxation and societal contribution is intricate and multifaceted, leading to diverse perspectives on whether paying taxes is a sufficient contribution to society. Although taxes play a crucial role in financing public services and infrastructure, I contend that taxation alone is not the sole indicator of societal contribution, as it neglects other essential avenues of civic engagement.Taxes are, without a doubt, vital for the functioning of a society, as they fund essential public services such as schools, hospitals, roads, and public safety, thereby enabling communities to flourish. Individuals who pay taxes are, undoubtedly, contributing to the collective well-being of their society. Nevertheless, this financial contribution does not represent the entirety of civic duty.Beyond financial contributions, active participation in the community, such as volunteer work, local governance, or social advocacy, is also a critical component of one's contribution to society. These activities involve dedicating time and effort to enhance the lives of others, foster social bonds, and cultivate a sense of community. For example, volunteering at a local shelter or participating in community clean-up initiatives has a direct impact on the social fabric, enhancing community cohesion in ways that financial contributions alone cannot.Furthermore, civic engagement, such as voting or participating in town hall meetings, empowers citizens to shape decisions that affect their lives and communities. This active involvement amplifies the voice of the community, ensuring that diverse perspectives are taken into account in governance.In conclusion, while paying taxes is a vital element of societal contribution, it should not be viewed as the only contributing factor. To truly enrich society, individuals must engage in a variety of activities that promote social well-being. Therefore, I argue that a comprehensive approach to civic responsibility encompasses both financial contributions, such as taxes, and active participation in the community, resulting in a more dynamic and responsive society.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";The age-old debate about the emphasis of school curricula often revolves around the question of whether subjects directly related to future careers should be prioritized over others, such as music and sports. Although it is undeniable that subjects like mathematics, science, and technology are vital for students pursuing specialized fields, I firmly believe that a well-rounded education, encompassing music and sports, is equally crucial for overall development.On one hand, subjects closely tied to future careers, such as mathematics and computer science, provide the necessary skills and knowledge required in today's competitive job market. For instance, having a grasp of data analytics is essential for careers in finance and technology, making it logical to prioritize these subjects from a practical perspective. Nevertheless, an exclusive focus on career-oriented subjects overlooks the diverse range of abilities and talents that each student possesses.On the other hand, music and sports play a vital role in fostering essential life skills that are beneficial, regardless of one's chosen career path. Engaging in sports teaches invaluable skills such as teamwork, discipline, and resilience, which are highly valued by employers across various sectors. Similarly, music education enhances creativity, cognitive skills, and problem-solving abilities. Moreover, exposure to the arts cultivates emotional intelligence and cultural awareness, qualities that are increasingly recognized as vital in today's globalized world.Additionally, a narrow emphasis on academic subjects can result in increased stress and burnout among students. Incorporating music and sports into the curriculum provides essential outlets for self-expression and stress relief, thereby promoting overall well-being. In conclusion, while it is essential for schools to provide students with career-relevant knowledge, it is equally important to incorporate subjects like music and sports into the educational framework. A balanced curriculum that nurtures both academic skills and personal growth ultimately prepares students not only for their future careers but for life in general.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The rise of the internet has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we access information, sparking a fierce debate about its potential to spell the end of traditional print media, such as newspapers and magazines. Although I recognize the significant influence of digital media on journalism, I firmly believe that it will not bring about the demise of print media, but rather its transformation.The primary advantage of online platforms is their unparalleled ability to provide immediate and accessible information. News can be updated instantly, meeting the demands of our fast-paced society. For example, during significant events such as elections or natural disasters, digital media can offer real-time updates that print media cannot compete with. This capacity for immediacy has particularly captivated younger audiences, who tend to prefer concise, visually engaging content commonly found online.Nevertheless, in an era where we are overwhelmed with information, the appeal of carefully curated content endures. Many readers continue to value the in-depth, high-quality journalism that newspapers and magazines deliver. Lengthy articles, investigative reports, and expert analyses often necessitate meticulous research and meticulous editing, which many online outlets struggle to maintain due to time constraints. For instance, publications such as The New Yorker and The Economist continue to flourish, attracting audiences willing to pay for superior journalism that provides in-depth examination rarely available online.Furthermore, print media engages readers on a tactile level that digital formats are unable to replicate. The sensory experience of flipping through the pages of a magazine or reading a newspaper with a cup of coffee is difficult to replace with scrolling through a screen. This physical presence fosters a connection with the content that many readers still cherish, cultivating a loyal readership that appreciates printed materials.In conclusion, while the internet has undoubtedly altered the landscape of information dissemination, it does not herald the end of newspapers and magazines. Instead, these traditional formats will evolve, discovering novel ways to coexist alongside digital media and catering to an audience that values both immediacy and depth. The internet and print media will likely learn to complement each other, providing a diverse range of options for consumers of information.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;When evaluating a job opportunity, salary is undoubtedly a significant consideration, but it is overly simplistic to claim that it is the only factor that matters. While a decent salary is essential for meeting fundamental needs and maintaining a comfortable lifestyle, it is not the sole driver of job satisfaction and career fulfillment. In fact, job satisfaction is influenced by a multitude of non-monetary factors, including workplace culture, opportunities for professional growth, job fulfillment, work-life balance, and personal passion for the work. For example, a high-paying job that comes with excessive stress, long working hours, and limited personal time can ultimately lead to burnout, making it less desirable than a lower-paying position that offers a healthy work-life balance and opportunities for personal growth.Furthermore, job stability and security are vital considerations that are often tied to salary packages. Many high-paying jobs come with high pressures and stakes that can jeopardize job security, whereas a stable position with a moderate salary can provide peace of mind and long-term career sustainability. Individual values and ambitions also play a significant role in shaping career choices. Many people prioritize work that is meaningful or aligns with their personal ethics over a high salary. For instance, professionals in fields such as education, social work, and healthcare often choose their careers for the positive impact they can have on society, despite the relatively modest compensation.In conclusion, while salary is undeniably an important factor in the job selection process, it should not be the only consideration. A comprehensive approach that takes into account various aspects, including job satisfaction, work environment, and personal values, is essential for achieving long-term fulfillment in one's career.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;The widespread integration of computers into children's daily routines has ignited a heated discussion, with many believing that the drawbacks surpass the benefits. Although computers undoubtedly provide access to educational materials and facilitate social connections, I firmly believe that their frequent use has more harmful consequences.Firstly, excessive computer use can have severe negative effects on children's physical well-being. Prolonged screen time leads to a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in problems such as obesity and poor posture. The appeal of digital entertainment often takes precedence over outdoor activities, which are vital for healthy physical growth.Furthermore, computers can significantly impact children's mental health. The pressure to present a perfect online image can lead to anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression. The rising incidence of cyberbullying also poses a significant threat, as it can hinder emotional development and lead to long-term psychological issues.Additionally, the cognitive effects of daily computer use are alarming. Over-reliance on technology can impair attention spans, critical thinking skills, and academic performance. Children may become accustomed to the instant gratification provided by technology, diminishing their capacity for deep, reflective thought and creativity.Moreover, the risk of screen addiction can create obstacles to family relationships and social interactions. When children are engrossed in their computers, they miss out on valuable opportunities for face-to-face interaction, which is essential for developing social skills and emotional intelligence.In conclusion, while computers undoubtedly have educational and social benefits, their daily use amongst children poses more negative consequences than positive. The potential risks of physical health problems, mental health challenges, impaired cognitive development, and weakened relationships highlight the need for responsible and mindful computer use in the digital age.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;The idea that children from low-income families are better prepared for the challenges of adulthood than those from wealthy backgrounds is a multifaceted issue that warrants thorough consideration. Although there are compelling arguments on both sides, I contend that children from economically disadvantaged families may acquire specific skills and resilience that can serve them well in adult life.Growing up in a financially constrained environment can foster personal growth, resourcefulness, and adaptability in children. With limited access to material possessions, they are often forced to develop creative problem-solving skills, learning to make the most of what they have. This adaptability can translate into innovation and resourcefulness in adulthood. Moreover, witnessing their parents' hard work to provide for the family instills a strong work ethic and an appreciation for the value of hard work.Additionally, children from lower-income families may develop greater empathy and social awareness. Navigating a world marked by economic disparities can cultivate gratitude and a desire to contribute positively to society. They tend to be more attuned to the challenges faced by others, resulting in a compassionate outlook and a commitment to social justice.On the other hand, it is crucial to recognize that children from affluent families may also benefit from certain advantages that can facilitate their transition into adulthood. Financial security can provide access to superior educational opportunities, networking connections, and experiences that can enhance personal growth. However, these advantages can sometimes lead to a sense of entitlement or a lack of resilience when confronted with obstacles.In conclusion, while both socioeconomic backgrounds present unique challenges and opportunities, I argue that children from less affluent families may develop a stronger foundation for navigating adult life, thanks to the resilience, empathy, and resourcefulness they often acquire. Ultimately, the ability to thrive in adulthood is shaped by a complex array of factors beyond financial status, including personal character, support systems, and individual experiences.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;The link between inactive lifestyles and the growing number of medical issues is becoming increasingly apparent in today's society. As technology improves and life becomes more convenient, physical activity is often neglected, leading many health experts to warn about the dangers of prolonged inactivity. I strongly believe that a sedentary lifestyle is a major contributor to many common medical problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and even mental health issues.The main reason for this is the increasing number of desk jobs and excessive time spent in front of screens, which significantly reduces physical activity. Many people now spend most of their time working on computers, using smartphones, or watching TV, resulting in a significant decrease in daily physical movement. According to the World Health Organization, lack of physical activity is a major risk factor for mortality worldwide. The weight gain that comes from not exercising enough can lead to obesity, which can cause a range of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease.Furthermore, a sedentary lifestyle can have negative effects on mental health. Not exercising enough has been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression. Physical activity releases endorphins, which improve mood and overall wellbeing. When people are mostly inactive, they miss out on the mental health benefits of regular exercise, which can make existing mental health issues worse.Moreover, the sedentary behavior that is common in modern life can have social consequences. People are less likely to take part in community activities that promote physical health and social interaction, both of which are important for good mental health.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the rise in medical problems can be largely attributed to sedentary lifestyles. Encouraging regular physical activity and discouraging prolonged inactivity is essential for improving health outcomes and quality of life in our increasingly sedentary world. Therefore, a cultural shift towards valuing physical movement over inactivity is crucial for tackling the medical challenges we face today.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";The discussion about the optimal time to introduce foreign language instruction in schools has sparked intense debate. I strongly agree with the numerous experts who advocate for starting language education as early as kindergarten, citing the numerous cognitive, social, and cultural advantages it offers.Firstly, research suggests that young children have a natural affinity for acquiring new languages, surpassing adults in their ability to learn. At this stage, their brains are exceptionally malleable, making it easier for them to learn new sounds, grammatical structures, and vocabulary. Introducing a foreign language at a young age can result in near-native pronunciation and fluency, skills that become progressively harder to attain as one gets older. By teaching languages in kindergarten, we capitalize on a critical period for language acquisition.Additionally, early foreign language instruction enhances cognitive development. Bilingual children often exhibit improved problem-solving skills, creativity, and multitasking abilities, according to studies. Learning a new language requires critical thinking about different structures and meanings, cultivating a more adaptable and innovative mindset. These skills are invaluable in today's interconnected world, where cross-cultural communication is essential.From a social perspective, introducing foreign languages at a young age fosters cultural appreciation and sensitivity. Children who learn a new language from a young age tend to be more open-minded and better equipped to engage with diverse communities. They develop empathy and a broader worldview, essential qualities for creating a more harmonious global society.Although implementing foreign language programs in kindergarten poses logistical challenges, such as training teachers and aligning curricula, the long-term benefits far outweigh these concerns. By introducing foreign language education at this formative stage, we are not only teaching children a new means of communication, but also preparing them to succeed in a multicultural world. Therefore, I firmly believe that foreign language instruction should commence in kindergarten.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;"The international tourism industry has experienced remarkable growth, making significant contributions to the global economy and fostering cultural exchange between nations. However, this rapid expansion has also introduced a plethora of challenges, which some argue outweigh its benefits. Despite the undeniable advantages of international tourism, I firmly believe that its associated problems necessitate a more balanced and sustainable approach to its development.On the one hand, international tourism presents numerous economic advantages. It is a substantial source of revenue for host countries, creates employment opportunities, and stimulates local economic growth. The influx of foreign visitors brings in foreign currency, which can be instrumental in improving infrastructure and public services. Moreover, tourism facilitates cultural exchange, enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds to interact, share experiences, and promote cross-cultural understanding.On the other hand, the issues associated with international tourism are becoming increasingly evident and often have devastating consequences. The environmental impact of tourism is a pressing concern, with the significant carbon footprint from air travel and the strain on local resources leading to habitat destruction, pollution, and depletion of water supplies. Furthermore, popular tourist destinations often struggle with overcrowding, which diminishes the quality of the visitor experience and disrupts the lives of local residents, leading to a phenomenon known as ""overtourism,"" where the appeal of a location is compromised by excessive visitor numbers.Moreover, international tourism can exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities. The economic benefits of tourism are frequently unevenly distributed, with large corporations capturing the majority of the profits while local communities may not benefit substantially. This can result in increased living costs and the commodification of local cultures, where traditions are altered to cater to the preferences of foreign visitors.In conclusion, while international tourism undoubtedly brings numerous economic and cultural benefits, its associated challenges cannot be ignored. A sustainable tourism development model must prioritize the interests of local communities and the preservation of natural resources. By addressing these concerns, it is possible to reap the benefits of international tourism while mitigating its negative impacts, ultimately ensuring a more equitable and environmentally conscious tourism industry."
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;The discussion about the role of television in children's education has gained momentum in recent years, with some proponents arguing for its integration into both school and home learning environments. Although I recognize the potential benefits of certain educational programs, I strongly disagree with the notion that children should watch TV regularly as a means of learning.There are several key points to consider. Firstly, the educational value of television is highly dependent on the type of content and the context in which it is viewed. Educational programs, such as documentaries and learning-oriented cartoons, can indeed offer valuable knowledge and stimulate curiosity. However, excessive screen time can lead to passive learning rather than active engagement, which is crucial for developing critical thinking and social skills through hands-on activities, reading, and interpersonal interactions. Overemphasizing television can hinder this essential aspect of childhood development.Furthermore, regular TV viewing is associated with several negative consequences. Excessive screen time has been linked to various health problems, including obesity, sleep issues, and reduced physical activity. Additionally, the abundance of entertainment content can expose children to inappropriate material, undermining the educational value. In an era of instant gratification, children may develop shorter attention spans and a decreased ability to focus on tasks requiring deeper cognitive engagement.Lastly, both family and school environments should prioritize activities that foster active learning and interaction. Engaging in reading, discussions, and creative projects offers far greater benefits to a child's overall development compared to watching TV. In conclusion, while television can serve as a supplementary tool in education, it should not be a regular part of children's learning experiences at home or school. Instead, a balanced approach that emphasizes active learning should be promoted, leading to healthier habits and more meaningful educational engagement.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;The internet has transformed the way we approach work and study, enabling us to do so from the comfort of our own homes. This significant shift brings with it a multitude of pros and cons that warrant thoughtful examination.A major benefit of working and studying remotely is the adaptability it offers. By eliminating the need for daily commutes, individuals can create personalized schedules that fit around their personal obligations, thereby enhancing their balance between work and personal life. For students, this adaptability can mean more time for extracurricular activities and personal projects. Furthermore, not having to commute saves time, reduces expenses on transportation, and contributes to a lower carbon footprint, all of which positively impact the environment.Remote work and study settings also often lead to higher productivity levels. Individuals can customize their work environment to suit their preferences, which for many, means better focus and concentration without the distractions commonly found in traditional office settings. This personalized approach can lead to superior outcomes, both academically for students and professionally for employees.However, a significant drawback of remote work and study is the lack of social interaction. This can lead to missing out on the social connections, collaborative opportunities, and networking that traditional environments provide. Additionally, the lines between personal and professional life can become blurred, making it challenging to maintain motivation and self-discipline while working from home.In conclusion, while there are notable challenges associated with remote work and study, the benefits such as flexibility, cost savings, and the potential for increased productivity, make them outweigh the drawbacks. It's essential, though, to mitigate the effects of social isolation through promoting virtual connections and establishing structured routines to offset the potential negative aspects. With the appropriate strategies in place, the prospect for the future of remote work and study looks promising.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;The international tourism industry has grown to become a significant driver of economic growth and job creation worldwide, sparking intense debate about its impact on cultural interactions. While some argue that tourism fuels cultural tensions, others believe it promotes cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.On the one hand, critics of tourism point to the risks of cultural commodification and appropriation, where tourists may unknowingly disrespect local customs, leading to misunderstandings and resentment among locals. The influx of tourists can also disrupt traditional ways of life, drive up prices, and cause feelings of alienation among residents. Furthermore, the violation of social norms by tourists can create friction between locals and visitors.On the other hand, proponents of tourism argue that it provides a unique opportunity for cultural exchange and understanding. Through direct interactions with diverse populations, tourists can gain insight into different ways of life, fostering empathy and breaking down stereotypes. By sharing experiences, individuals from diverse backgrounds can develop mutual respect and understanding. Many countries have successfully utilized tourism to promote their cultural heritage, raising global awareness and appreciation of local traditions and values.In conclusion, international tourism has the potential to both create cultural tensions and bridge gaps between different societies. The impact of tourism on cultural relations ultimately depends on the interactions between tourists and host communities. By promoting responsible tourism practices and cultural sensitivity, it is possible to mitigate tensions and foster greater understanding between nations. With proper management and education, international tourism can be a powerful tool for promoting cross-cultural understanding, making it a more beneficial than harmful force in the long run.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;The way people view celebrities has changed significantly in today's society. With the rise of social media and reality TV, the focus has shifted from celebrating talent and hard work to admiring glamour and wealth. Now, many celebrities are famous for their lavish lifestyles rather than their professional accomplishments, which is worrying for young people.I mostly agree that this is a problem. When young people see celebrities showing off their wealth and luxurious lives, and getting praised for superficial things, it creates an unrealistic idea of what success looks like. The message is that happiness and self-worth come from material possessions and being admired by the public. This can lead to disappointment and misguided priorities among young people, who may value fame over substance and effort.Furthermore, the emphasis on glamour often overshadows the achievements of deserving individuals who work hard behind the scenes. Progress in fields like science, art, and social activism is crucial for society, but it rarely gets the same recognition as fame and fortune. This disparity can discourage young people from pursuing careers in important but less glamorous fields.However, not all celebrities fit this pattern. Many use their influence to advocate for social change, support charitable causes, and inspire young people through their work. It's essential for young people to tell the difference between celebrities who promote positive values and those who perpetuate a superficial culture.In summary, the current trend of glorifying glamour and wealth over real achievements among celebrities can set a bad example for young people. It's crucial for society and the media to celebrate individuals who demonstrate hard work and positive contributions, encouraging young people to aim for more than just temporary fame.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;"The discussion about the impact of television on children's learning has gained significant attention in recent years. Although some people believe that watching TV can hinder a child's educational development, I firmly believe that television, when used thoughtfully, can be a valuable tool for learning and should be promoted in both homes and schools.One of the primary advantages of television is its ability to convey knowledge and promote critical thinking skills through engaging educational programs. Shows such as ""Sesame Street"" and ""Bluey"" combine entertainment and education, covering essential topics like language, mathematics, social skills, and cultural awareness. These programs cater to children's natural curiosity, helping them establish connections between concepts through engaging storylines, which enhances retention and understanding. In essence, television serves as a supplement to traditional learning methods, extending classroom instruction.Furthermore, television provides children with access to a broader range of information, allowing them to explore various cultures, historical events, and scientific phenomena that may not be readily available in their immediate environment. This exposure enhances their general knowledge and fosters empathy and understanding of global issues, ultimately preparing them to become more informed and engaged citizens in the future.It is essential, however, to promote mindful consumption of television among children. Parents and educators should carefully select the content that children watch, emphasizing programs that promote learning and positive values. By establishing limits and encouraging discussions about the viewed content, adults can transform passive viewing into an interactive and reflective experience.In conclusion, while the concerns about excessive screen time and passive viewing are legitimate, the potential benefits of educational television in enhancing a child's learning experience are substantial. With careful selection and guidance, watching television can be a beneficial activity that enriches children's learning experiences both at home and in school. Therefore, I support the idea of promoting children's viewing, as long as it is done thoughtfully and with consideration."
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;"The notion that workers over 50 are less responsive to the rapid pace of change in the modern workplace is a broad and inaccurate generalization that disregards the varied skills and experiences of older employees. Although it is true that younger workers may be more familiar with current technologies and trends, the assumption that older workers are inherently less adaptable is an unfair and inaccurate representation.To begin with, it is crucial to recognize the vast experience that older workers bring to the workplace. Having navigated numerous economic shifts, technological advancements, and evolving work environments, these individuals often possess a deep understanding of industry nuances that younger workers may not have. Their resilience and adaptability, developed over decades, enable them to effectively respond to new challenges and innovate. For example, many older workers have successfully adapted to remote work and adopted new technologies, demonstrating their capacity to adapt.Furthermore, age diversity in the workplace is highly valuable. Companies benefit from a diverse range of ideas and strategies that encompass multiple generations. Older workers can serve as mentors, sharing their wisdom and practical knowledge to enrich the overall workforce. By promoting an inclusive environment that celebrates age diversity, organizations can foster creativity and problem-solving capabilities that leverage the strengths of all employees, regardless of age.It is also essential to acknowledge the potential age biases that exist in the workplace. Disregarding older workers based on their age can lead to the loss of valuable skills and insights. Hiring decisions based on age rather than competence can hinder a company's innovation and growth.In conclusion, rather than prioritizing younger workers based on their perceived agility, it is vital to appreciate the strengths that older employees bring to modern workplaces. Adaptability is not exclusive to any particular age group; therefore, fostering a culture that values the contributions of all employees, regardless of age, will ultimately lead to more dynamic and successful organizations."
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The modern era is characterized by the swift integration of machinery into everyday life, transforming the way tasks are performed across various sectors, from industrial settings to domestic environments. The incorporation of automation and robotics has led to significant changes, taking over responsibilities that were previously exclusive to human workers. This shift offers notable benefits, including heightened efficiency and productivity, but it also presents considerable drawbacks that necessitate examination. The evaluation of whether the benefits surpass the drawbacks is contingent upon a multitude of contextual elements.The positive aspects of mechanization and automation are multifaceted. They have induced profound transformations in industries by optimizing production workflows, resulting in outputs that are not only faster and more precise but also frequently more economical. This heightened efficiency caters to the escalating consumer demand and facilitates the reallocation of human resources to more intricate tasks that necessitate innovation and analytical thinking. Additionally, machinery is capable of undertaking perilous tasks, thereby diminishing workplace accidents and ensuring the safety of human laborers.However, the escalating dependence on machinery also poses grave challenges. A paramount concern is the displacement of jobs. As machinery continues to evolve and acquire the capability to perform tasks that previously demanded human expertise, a substantial segment of the workforce may find itself superfluous. This displacement can precipitate economic instability and elevated unemployment rates, particularly among low-skilled laborers who have restricted opportunities for retraining or augmenting their skills. Furthermore, an over-reliance on machinery may culminate in the erosion of valuable human skills and craftsmanship, leading to a societal disconnection from manual labor.In summation, while the benefits of machinery, including augmented efficiency, safety, and productivity, are compelling, the drawbacks, particularly job displacement and the deterioration of human skills, should not be disregarded. To navigate this technological paradigm shift responsibly, it is essential for society to strike a balance that embraces innovation while concurrently safeguarding employment and fostering human skill development. Consequently, whether the benefits genuinely outweigh the drawbacks remains a complex issue that warrants meticulous consideration and thoughtful deliberation.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;The interplay between technological progress and traditional skills is a multifaceted and debated topic. While it is true that the advancement of technology has led to the decline of certain traditional practices, preserving these skills is essential for maintaining cultural identity and value that cannot be replicated by technology. Although technology offers numerous benefits, I firmly believe that preserving traditional skills and ways of life is not a futile endeavor.On the one hand, technological advancements can make traditional skills obsolete, as machines and automation often surpass human capabilities. The rise of industrial farming, for instance, has reduced the need for traditional farming techniques, resulting in a disconnect from local food sources and a loss of knowledge about sustainable farming methods. This can lead to cultural homogenization, where unique local customs are replaced by standardized mass-produced practices.On the other hand, the notion that preserving traditional skills is pointless overlooks their inherent value. Traditional skills often embody a community's history, values, and cultural identity, fostering a connection to the land and a sense of community. Moreover, the recent surge in interest in artisanal products, organic farming, and sustainable living suggests that traditional practices can complement modernization and have a viable market.In conclusion, while technological advancements may render some traditional skills outdated, efforts to preserve them are not in vain. By balancing technological innovation with the preservation of cultural heritage, we can enrich society, promote diversity, and strengthen community bonds. Rather than viewing traditional skills as outdated relics, we should recognize them as vital components of our social fabric that merit preservation alongside modern developments.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;The notion that minimizing travel needs for work, education, and shopping is the only way to alleviate urban traffic congestion presents a critical viewpoint on the issue. Although I concur that decreasing travel demand can help mitigate traffic congestion, I firmly believe that it is not a standalone solution. Instead, a comprehensive approach is required to effectively address this complex problem.One significant factor in reducing traffic congestion is the growth of remote work arrangements. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted numerous businesses to adopt flexible work schedules, resulting in fewer commuters during peak hours. By encouraging telecommuting, cities can alleviate the pressure on their transportation infrastructure, as a decrease in the number of people on the roads directly translates to reduced traffic congestion.Furthermore, the rise of online education and e-commerce has revolutionized traditional frameworks, enabling individuals to access educational opportunities and shop without the necessity of traveling. Educational institutions that offer online or hybrid courses can substantially decrease the number of daily commutes. Similarly, promoting local shopping through advanced e-commerce options can help ease congestion by reducing the need for residents to travel extensive distances for goods and services.However, reducing travel needs alone is insufficient to combat urban congestion. It is equally essential for cities to enhance their public transportation systems, rendering them more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly. Investing in alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, can foster more sustainable commuting options. Urban planning strategies that incorporate mixed-use developments can also promote local living, thereby minimizing the distances people need to travel for work or leisure activities.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of reducing travel needs in combating urban traffic congestion, I strongly advocate for a multifaceted approach that combines this strategy with improvements in public transportation, urban design, and alternative commuting solutions. Adopting a holistic approach is vital for creating sustainable, livable, and congestion-free cities.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;The influence of celebrity culture on society, particularly among young people, has grown significantly. While some celebrities are admired for their skills and dedication, many others are primarily celebrated for their luxurious lifestyles and vast fortunes. This raises concerns about the role models young people look up to, prompting questions about the potential dangers of idolizing these figures.On the one hand, it can be argued that celebrities often represent achievement and aspiration, motivating young people to chase their dreams. For example, entrepreneurs like Rihanna and Jay-Z, who have built business empires from their artistic careers, demonstrate how passion and perseverance can lead to success. Their stories highlight that wealth is not achieved without hard work, making them inspirational figures for young individuals to strive for their own objectives.On the other hand, the portrayal of celebrity lifestyles often prioritizes superficial values like materialism and social standing, potentially sending harmful messages. Many prominent celebrities are famous not for their contributions to society or talents, but for scandals, lavish lifestyles, and public images. This emphasis on appearance and wealth can lead young people to value fame over personal achievement, undermining the importance of hard work and commitment. Furthermore, the constant scrutiny and pressure to maintain a certain image can have negative effects on mental health, suggesting that the path to fame is filled with unseen challenges.In summary, although some celebrities can be motivational and inspiring, the dominant focus on glamour and wealth can foster unhealthy aspirations in young people. It is crucial for young individuals to distinguish between genuine accomplishments and superficial fame, seeking out role models who embody integrity, resilience, and true success. By balancing admiration for public figures with an understanding of their complexities, young people may be able to mitigate the risks associated with idolizing celebrity culture.
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;The issue of achieving gender equality in higher education, particularly in university admissions, has become a prominent concern in recent years. The idea that universities should strive for equal numbers of male and female students in every field of study sparks important discussions about fairness, merit-based admissions, and the characteristics of various academic disciplines.On the one hand, promoting equal representation can be seen as crucial for overcoming ingrained biases and stereotypes that deter certain genders from pursuing particular subjects. Traditionally, fields like engineering and physics have been dominated by men, while humanities and social sciences have tended to attract more women. By promoting balanced gender representation, universities can foster a more diverse and inclusive learning environment that encourages a variety of perspectives and ideas. Research has shown that increased diversity can lead to improved creativity, problem-solving skills, and overall academic achievement.On the other hand, enforcing strict gender quotas raises concerns about the potential compromise of merit and individual freedom of choice. The primary focus of education should be on the abilities and aspirations of students, rather than on meeting specific demographic targets. Implementing equal admissions policies could inadvertently result in less qualified candidates being accepted over more qualified ones, solely based on their gender, which could ultimately undermine academic excellence. Moreover, students should have the autonomy to choose their fields of study based on their personal interests and aptitudes, rather than being guided by societal expectations of gender equality.In summary, while promoting gender balance in higher education is vital and should be supported, it is crucial to achieve this goal through measures that encourage and support students, rather than through rigid quotas. Initiatives such as outreach programs, mentorship opportunities, and scholarships can help promote equality without compromising the academic integrity of institutions. The ultimate goal should be to create a university environment that is welcoming and supportive of all students, allowing them to succeed based on their unique talents and interests.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;The severe health consequences of smoking are universally acknowledged, with substantial evidence showing that it is a major cause of preventable deaths globally. Consequently, the push for enforcing strict regulations on smoking in public areas has gained considerable momentum. I strongly advocate for the adoption of stricter smoking regulations in public spaces worldwide, and my reasoning is based on several crucial factors.Primarily, safeguarding public health is of utmost importance. Smoking poses significant risks not only to the smoker but also to bystanders through second-hand smoke exposure. According to the World Health Organization, second-hand smoke contains more than 7,000 toxic chemicals, with no known safe exposure level. By imposing smoking bans in public areas, governments can substantially mitigate these risks, thereby shielding vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing medical conditions from the perils of involuntary smoke exposure.Furthermore, such regulations play a vital role in fostering a healthier society. By establishing smoke-free environments in public spaces, we encourage individuals to contemplate quitting smoking or refrain from initiating the habit. This, in turn, triggers a ripple effect, wherein the diminished visibility of smoking in everyday life leads to shifting social norms and a subsequent decline in smoking prevalence over time. Empirical evidence from nations with stringent smoking bans, such as Ireland and Australia, demonstrates a notable decline in smoking rates following the enactment of comprehensive smoking legislation.Lastly, the implementation of smoking bans in public areas can also alleviate the economic burden on healthcare systems. Smoking-related illnesses substantially contribute to healthcare expenditures, and by promoting a smoke-free population, governments can alleviate some of these costs, thereby reallocating resources to more pressing areas of public health.In conclusion, given the compelling evidence regarding the detrimental effects of smoking and its far-reaching implications for society, I firmly believe that all countries should implement strict regulations on smoking in public areas. This would pave the way for healthier communities, contribute to a decline in smoking-related illnesses and deaths, and ultimately foster a better quality of life for generations to come.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;The tourism industry, often touted as a key economic driver in numerous regions, has faced criticism for its part in exacerbating economic inequalities, environmental damage, and cultural erosion. Critics argue that tourism can be seen as a modern-day equivalent of colonialism, as it often exploits local resources and communities in a manner reminiscent of colonial-era practices, albeit in a contemporary setting.Proponents of this viewpoint contend that tourism warps local economies by favoring foreign investments over the needs and interests of indigenous communities. In many popular tourist destinations, the majority of tourism-generated revenue flows to multinational corporations, leaving local residents in economically vulnerable positions. The prioritization of tourist demands can lead to inflated prices for essential goods and services, effectively marginalizing locals and undermining their traditional ways of life. This phenomenon echoes the colonial era, where local economies were frequently undermined to benefit external parties.Furthermore, the environmental impact of mass tourism is unmistakable. The influx of tourists can result in the destruction of natural habitats, pollution, and the overexploitation of natural resources. Many tourist hotspots struggle with managing waste and infrastructure, leading to substantial environmental costs. This aspect is reminiscent of colonial-era exploitation, where natural resources were extracted without consideration for sustainability or the well-being of local populations.However, it is essential to acknowledge that tourism, when managed responsibly, can also be a catalyst for positive change. Sustainable tourism initiatives strive to empower local communities, preserve cultural heritage, and safeguard the environment. When local stakeholders are actively involved in decision-making processes, tourism can foster economic growth while respecting local customs and traditions.In conclusion, while concerns regarding the destructive aspects of tourism, which bear resemblance to colonial practices, are valid, it is crucial to recognize the potential for sustainable tourism models that support, rather than exploit, local communities. Achieving a balance between economic benefits and environmental and cultural preservation is vital to transforming tourism from a potential exploitative force into a platform for reciprocal growth and respect.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;The past twenty years have witnessed a revolution in information technology (IT), transforming the way we interact, communicate, and do business. Innovations like the World Wide Web and email have greatly improved global connectivity and access to information, creating a more interconnected world. However, a debate is ongoing about whether future IT advancements will have more negative than positive consequences.On the one hand, the benefits of IT are undeniable. Instant global communication has transformed personal relationships, created new opportunities for collaboration and learning, and enabled entrepreneurs to thrive through e-commerce, driving economic growth and innovation. On the other hand, looking to the future, several concerns suggest that IT advancements may have detrimental effects. A significant issue is the erosion of privacy, as advancing technology leads to increased collection of personal data, potentially being misused by corporations and governments. Notable data breaches and surveillance scandals have raised concerns about individual freedom and consent.Moreover, the rise of artificial intelligence and automation may exacerbate economic inequality. While promising efficiency and convenience, these technologies also threaten jobs, particularly in low-skilled sectors, potentially leading to widespread unemployment and social unrest, creating societal divides.The pervasive influence of social media has also been linked to mental health issues and misinformation. As technology becomes more integral to our lives, the potential for cyberbullying, addiction, and manipulation of information may deepen societal divides and compromise democratic processes.In conclusion, although the past twenty years of IT advancements have been largely positive, the future trajectory poses significant risks. It is crucial to balance innovation with ethical considerations to ensure technology serves humanity. Therefore, I moderately agree that future IT advancements are likely to have more negative effects than positive, especially if the challenges are not addressed thoughtfully. 
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;The increasing popularity of vegetarianism in modern society signifies a change in dietary preferences that transcends the traditional debate surrounding animal welfare. Although concerns about animal treatment are a crucial factor in many individuals' decision to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle, other factors are also driving this trend.A major reason for the growing adoption of vegetarianism is the rising awareness of health benefits. As people become more informed about the negative health impacts associated with excessive meat consumption, such as heart disease, obesity, and certain cancers, they are opting for plant-based diets. Research indicates that a balanced vegetarian diet can lead to improved health outcomes, including lower cholesterol levels and better heart health, prompting individuals to make dietary changes to achieve a healthier lifestyle.Environmental issues are also a key motivator for choosing vegetarianism. The livestock industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water scarcity. With the escalating concern about climate change, many individuals are motivated to reduce their environmental impact by choosing plant-based diets. Studies show that producing plant-based foods generally requires fewer resources than meat production, making vegetarian diets a more sustainable option for those concerned about the planet's well-being.Furthermore, cultural and socioeconomic factors are influencing this trend. The increasing availability of vegetarian and plant-based products in the market has made dietary changes more accessible and convenient. The wide range of meat-free options now offered by restaurants and grocery stores has created an environment that supports vegetarianism. Additionally, globalization has introduced diverse culinary practices and plant-based cuisines, inspiring individuals to explore vegetarian diets in a new light.In summary, while concerns about animal rights remain important, the benefits to health, environmental sustainability, and cultural influences are equally compelling reasons for the growing number of individuals embracing vegetarianism. This complex trend highlights a broader shift towards conscious living and responsible consumerism in our society.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;The debate surrounding the relationship between technological progress and the preservation of traditional skills and ways of life has been ongoing and contentious. Although it is undeniable that modernization can lead to the decline of certain traditions, I firmly believe that preserving them is not a futile endeavor.On the one hand, technological advancements have the potential to improve the quality of life and stimulate economic growth. As societies adopt innovative technologies, they often abandon outdated practices that are no longer practical or efficient. For example, the introduction of automation in agriculture has led to increased productivity, reducing the need for labor-intensive traditional farming methods. Nevertheless, this does not imply that traditional techniques should be completely discarded. Many of these practices hold significant cultural value and embody sustainable approaches that may be overlooked by modern methods.Moreover, the erosion of traditional skills can result in cultural homogenization. As countries worldwide adopt similar technologies and lifestyles, they risk losing the unique identities that have been shaped over generations. Preserving traditional skills can foster a sense of community and pride among locals. For instance, crafts such as pottery, weaving, and traditional cooking not only contribute to cultural heritage but also attract tourists and boost local economies.On the other hand, some argue that preserving traditional practices can hinder progress and innovation. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that modernization and tradition can coexist harmoniously. Many communities have successfully integrated modern technology with traditional practices, enabling them to thrive while maintaining their cultural roots.In conclusion, while technological development is vital for progress, the outright rejection of traditional skills and ways of life is a myopic approach. Preserving these elements can enrich society, provide economic opportunities, and foster a sense of identity in a rapidly changing world. Rather than viewing them as mutually exclusive, we should strive for a harmonious balance between tradition and innovation. 
372;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime."" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the ""legalized revenge"" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.Finally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. To conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty.";The issue of capital punishment has been a longstanding topic of controversy, with the debate often revolving around its supposed ability to deter crime. Advocates of the death penalty claim that it is essential for maintaining social order and reducing violent crime rates, arguing that the threat of execution deters potential offenders from committing heinous crimes. However, a more detailed analysis reveals a complex relationship between capital punishment and crime control.Proponents of capital punishment argue that the severity of the death penalty serves as a strong deterrent, as the fear of execution may discourage individuals from engaging in violent behavior, particularly murder. The reasoning is simple: the severe and permanent consequences of capital punishment may cause individuals to think twice before committing acts that could lead to their execution.Yet, numerous studies have failed to establish a definitive link between capital punishment and reduced crime rates. In fact, many countries that have abolished the death penalty have not seen a significant increase in violent crime rates. For example, countries such as Canada and many European nations have experienced stable or declining crime rates despite not having capital punishment, suggesting that other factors like socioeconomic conditions, education, and effective law enforcement play a more crucial role in ensuring public safety.Furthermore, capital punishment raises significant ethical concerns, including the risk of wrongful convictions and the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. The irreversible nature of the death penalty poses a substantial risk of executing innocent individuals, undermining the justice it aims to uphold.In conclusion, the evidence suggests that the effectiveness of capital punishment in deterring crime is questionable and fraught with moral implications. Alternative approaches focusing on rehabilitation, prevention, and community support may be more effective in addressing the root causes of violence and creating a safer society. Therefore, I argue that capital punishment is not necessary for controlling violence, and a reevaluation of our justice system could lead to more humane and effective outcomes. 
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;The notion that zoos are devoid of purpose is a subjective claim that can be viewed from multiple angles, influenced by individual perspectives and values. However, I strongly disagree with this statement, as I firmly believe that zoos fulfill several significant roles that benefit both education and conservation.One of the primary functions of zoos is to educate the public about wildlife and their natural habitats. Since many people lack the opportunity to experience wildlife in their natural environments, zoos offer a unique setting for individuals, particularly children, to gain knowledge about various species, their behaviors, and the ecosystems they inhabit. Through meticulously designed exhibits and informative programs, zoos cultivate a connection between the public and wildlife, thereby raising awareness about environmental concerns and promoting conservation initiatives. For example, numerous zoos implement outreach programs that educate students about the importance of biodiversity and the threats faced by endangered species.Furthermore, zoos are actively engaged in conservation efforts. The decline of many animal species can be attributed to habitat destruction, poaching, and climate change. Zoos participate in breeding programs aimed at increasing the population of threatened species, with organizations like the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) coordinating these endeavors to reintroduce species into their natural habitats. A notable example is the California condor, which was once on the brink of extinction but has experienced a resurgence thanks to zoo-initiated breeding programs.In conclusion, although some zoos have been rightfully criticized for prioritizing entertainment over education and conservation, the overall purpose of well-managed zoos remains substantial. They function as vital centers for learning and conservation, helping to bridge the gap between humans and the natural world. Therefore, I firmly believe that zoos do serve a useful purpose in today's society, and their contributions to education and conservation are invaluable.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";"The debate surrounding government allocation of public funds to preserve endangered languages is highly polarized. Proponents of language preservation assert that each language embodies distinct cultural values, historical context, and knowledge that are vital to human civilization's diversity. They argue that the loss of a language results in the loss of a unique worldview, cultural identities, and historical narratives. For example, Indigenous languages often possess specialized ecological knowledge and traditional practices that are invaluable to both local communities and society at large. Government funding for these languages could facilitate cultural revitalization, strengthen community ties, and promote societal appreciation for diversity.On the other hand, critics argue that investing in the preservation of small language groups is impractical due to limited public resources. They believe that these resources should be channeled towards initiatives with more immediate societal impacts, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. From their perspective, allocating funds to languages with only a few speakers seems illogical when more pressing social issues demand attention. Moreover, critics contend that languages naturally evolve and decline over time as societies change, rendering preservation efforts futile.In my view, while concerns about resource allocation are legitimate, the importance of cultural preservation should not be underestimated. Preserving endangered languages is about more than just maintaining a means of communication; it is an investment in cultural heritage and diversity. It is possible to prioritize funds in a manner that balances language preservation with essential public services. By promoting linguistic diversity, we enrich the global community and foster cross-cultural respect. Therefore, I believe that governments should consider funding the preservation of endangered languages as a component of their commitment to cultural sustainability."
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";There is a growing consensus that a significant portion of a country's healthcare budget should be allocated towards health education and preventative measures, rather than solely focusing on treatment. I firmly support this idea, and for good reason.Primarily, health education empowers individuals with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their lifestyle. When people are well-informed, they are better equipped to prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, which are often caused by poor lifestyle choices. By emphasizing education on healthy eating habits, exercise, and the risks associated with smoking and excessive drinking, we can decrease the incidence of these diseases and subsequently reduce treatment costs.Furthermore, preventative measures such as vaccinations and regular health check-ups play a vital role in reducing the occurrence of diseases before they require more costly treatments. For example, increased funding for vaccination programs can lead to lower rates of infectious diseases, thereby easing the burden on healthcare facilities and decreasing hospitalization rates. The World Health Organization has long advocated for the effectiveness of preventative health measures, highlighting their importance in maintaining public health and ensuring economic stability.Moreover, shifting the focus from treatment to prevention could yield substantial long-term financial benefits for governments. Although the initial investment in health education and preventative initiatives may be substantial, the reduction in healthcare costs associated with treating advanced diseases could result in significant savings for governments. These savings can then be reinvested in other health initiatives or sectors that require financial support.In conclusion, prioritizing health education and preventative measures over treatment is not only a wise allocation of a nation's healthcare budget, but also a necessary strategy for creating a healthier society. Through such investments, countries can foster a more informed and health-conscious population, reduce healthcare costs, and ultimately enhance the overall quality of life for their citizens.
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The issue of making university education accessible to a wider audience has sparked a significant amount of debate in recent years. Although some argue that university admissions should be limited to students who excel academically, I firmly believe that education should be available to a broader range of individuals for several key reasons.Primarily, education is a basic human right that plays a crucial role in both personal and societal growth. Limiting access to university education based on academic achievement goes against the principle of equal opportunities. Many individuals who may not perform exceptionally well in traditional academic settings have valuable skills and abilities that can make significant contributions to a diverse workforce. By opening up university education to a more diverse range of students, we can foster the creativity and innovation that are essential in today's fast-paced job market.Moreover, universities provide a platform for personal growth, critical thinking, and social development. Restricting university admissions based solely on academic records may deprive society of potential future leaders and change-makers who could emerge from non-traditional academic backgrounds. Many successful individuals, such as entrepreneurs and innovators, have achieved success without necessarily following the traditional path of academic excellence. Their unique perspectives can enhance the university learning environment, leading to rich and beneficial discussions for all students.Furthermore, the modern job market places a high value on skills and practical experience over academic credentials. As employers increasingly seek candidates with a range of skills and experiences, a more inclusive university admissions policy can help equip students with the diverse skill sets needed to succeed. Programs tailored to different aptitudes, such as vocational training and experiential learning, can empower students who may not fit the traditional academic mold, providing them with a pathway to success.In conclusion, while academic excellence is an important factor in university admissions, limiting access to education solely based on academic proficiency would hinder the potential of many individuals and restrict the inclusive growth of society. Education should be viewed as a pathway available to all, nurturing a diverse and skilled population that is equipped to navigate the complexities of the modern world.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;"The old saying ""parents are the best teachers"" may be true in many situations, but I don't think it's entirely accurate to say that parents are the best teachers in every way. To really understand this idea, we need to look at both the good and bad things about parents teaching their children.One of the main reasons parents are so important in education is that they teach kids the basic skills they need to survive and thrive. From a very young age, parents show their children how to do things like walk, talk, and interact with others. The lessons kids learn at home play a big role in shaping their personality, values, and beliefs. For example, parents teach kids about kindness, respect, and being a good citizen. They also give their kids the emotional support and encouragement they need to feel good about themselves and be motivated to keep learning throughout their lives.However, while parents are great at teaching morals and values, they might not be as good at teaching specific school subjects. Many parents don't have the latest teaching methods or know enough about certain subjects to teach them well. For instance, a parent might struggle to teach their kid advanced math or science, which are crucial for doing well in school. Teachers in schools are trained to teach kids with different learning styles and can adapt their lessons to help all their students, which is something many parents might not be able to do.Additionally, the people and teachers kids meet outside of the home can offer different viewpoints and knowledge that can make their learning experience richer. Schools are places where kids can work together, think critically, and learn skills they'll need as adults.In the end, while parents definitely start their kids off on the right foot and help them develop as people, it's clear that education is about more than just what parents teach. When parents, teachers, and peers work together, kids get a well-rounded education. This suggests that no one person or group can be called the ""best teacher."""
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;When it comes to choosing a career, salary is often the top priority for many people. However, while financial rewards are undeniably important, they are not the only factor, and for some individuals, not even the most important one, in determining job satisfaction and career fulfillment.On the one hand, a good salary offers a sense of security and stability, enabling individuals to provide for themselves and their loved ones, as well as achieve their personal financial objectives. Given the rising cost of living, especially in cities, a higher salary can reduce stress and improve one's overall quality of life. For many people, the financial aspect is a major motivator, particularly during life stages where financial burdens are significant, such as raising children or paying off loans.On the other hand, prioritizing salary above all else oversimplifies the complex process of selecting a job. Other factors like job satisfaction, work-life balance, opportunities for growth, and workplace culture also play vital roles in ensuring long-term happiness and engagement in a role. For example, individuals in creative fields or those passionate about making a social impact often prioritize their work environment and job alignment with their personal values over financial rewards. A high-stress job with a high salary may lead to burnout if it lacks supportive leadership or a positive work culture.Furthermore, the significance of salary varies depending on one's career stage or personal situation. A new graduate may prioritize salary as they enter the job market, whereas someone with more experience may prioritize job satisfaction or work conditions over a high salary.In conclusion, although salary is an essential consideration when selecting a job, it should not overshadow other vital factors that contribute to a fulfilling work life. Adopting a balanced approach that takes into account both financial and personal satisfaction is crucial for achieving long-term career happiness.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;The discussion about taxing petrol and diesel to reduce private car usage is highly debated, as it involves a complex interplay of environmental concerns, economic factors, and social fairness. Personally, I largely support increasing taxes on fossil fuels, especially for transportation purposes.The environmental rationale is particularly convincing. The combustion of fossil fuels for transportation is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, which worsen climate change and have severe environmental repercussions. By increasing taxes on petrol and diesel, governments can encourage people to opt for alternative transportation methods like public transportation, biking, or walking. This change could substantially decrease carbon emissions, thus contributing to global climate objectives.Furthermore, the income generated from higher fuel taxes can be utilized to develop sustainable infrastructure. Investing in public transportation systems, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly urban planning can offer practical alternatives to driving, making public transportation a feasible option for more individuals. As a result, the dependence on private vehicles can decrease, leading to less traffic congestion and lower air pollution levels overall.However, it's essential to address this issue with consideration for socioeconomic factors. Many people rely on private cars for their daily commutes, especially in rural or less accessible areas where public transportation options are limited. A substantial tax increase without adequate support systems in place could unfairly affect low-income families. Thus, any tax policy should be accompanied by measures such as public transportation subsidies, incentives for using electric vehicles, and investments in cleaner alternatives.In summary, while increasing taxes on petrol and diesel can significantly contribute to addressing the environmental issues caused by private car usage, it's crucial to implement this policy thoughtfully, balancing environmental needs with social fairness. This multifaceted approach can lead to a sustainable future for transportation.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;The debate over whether arming police forces contributes to increased violence in society is a complex and contentious issue that demands thorough consideration. On the one hand, a strong argument exists that the presence of firearms can heighten tensions during interactions between law enforcement and civilians, thereby creating an environment more prone to violence. The deployment of armed police officers may foster a sense of threat and escalate confrontations, potentially leading to a vicious cycle of violence. This is evident in the widespread protests and civil unrest sparked by incidents of police shootings, which suggest that communities may feel more intimidated than protected by the presence of armed officers.On the other hand, advocates of arming police argue that firearms are indispensable for effective law enforcement, particularly in dealing with violent crimes and ensuring public safety. In high-risk situations, such as armed robberies or terrorist attacks, the capacity to respond with lethal force can be vital. From this perspective, armed police do not create violence but rather serve as a deterrent against criminal activities by providing law enforcement with the necessary tools to handle dangerous situations.Ultimately, the impact of armed police on societal violence is multifaceted and depends on various factors, including training, accountability, and community relations. Studies have shown that proper training in de-escalation techniques and community engagement is associated with reduced instances of violence. Moreover, implementing transparency and accountability measures can help foster trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. Therefore, while the presence of firearms may contribute to increased violence in certain contexts, it is not the mere act of carrying guns that dictates societal violence. Rather, it is the broader systemic issues surrounding policing that also need to be addressed.In conclusion, the arming of police can contribute to a culture of violence, but it is the societal context, training, and community relationships that play a pivotal role in determining whether the armed presence of police becomes a source of conflict or a means of ensuring public safety. It is essential to consider these factors to fully understand the complex relationship between armed police and societal violence.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;The advent of the digital age has revolutionized the educational landscape, granting students unparalleled access to vast repositories of information at unprecedented speeds. I wholeheartedly endorse the notion that technology significantly enhances the learning experience, facilitating students to acquire more knowledge while expediting their learning process.Primarily, the internet functions as a vast knowledge bank, where students can effortlessly access a myriad of online resources, including databases, academic journals, and educational platforms such as Khan Academy, Coursera, and YouTube, with merely a few clicks. This extensive array of resources enables learners to explore subjects in greater depth and from diverse perspectives, thereby enriching their comprehension. For example, a biology student can augment their understanding by watching tutorials, reading scientific papers, and engaging in interactive simulations, all of which transcend the limitations of traditional textbooks.Furthermore, technology facilitates personalized learning experiences, courtesy of artificial intelligence-powered platforms that adapt to an individual's learning style and pace. These platforms identify areas of strength and weakness, tailoring educational content to cater to the learner's needs. For instance, language-learning platforms such as Duolingo utilize gamified lessons, permitting students to progress at their own pace, thereby augmenting retention and engagement.Moreover, technology enables seamless communication and knowledge-sharing among peers through collaborative tools and social media platforms. Students can effortlessly form study groups or engage in discussions on forums, thereby cementing their understanding through collaborative learning. The ability to pose questions in real-time on platforms such as Stack Exchange or social media further enriches the learning experience, expediting clarification and fostering a culture of inquiry.In conclusion, the amalgamation of technology in education undoubtedly empowers students to learn more efficaciously. By providing instant access to information, facilitating personalized learning experiences, and promoting collaboration, technology equips students with the requisite tools for efficacious learning in today's fast-paced world. As we continue to embrase these digital advancements, the potential for educational growth remains boundless. 
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;The past century has seen unprecedented technological advancements that have transformed various aspects of human life. Breakthroughs in medicine and the emergence of the internet have significantly improved the overall quality of life. However, these advancements have also been accompanied by notable negative consequences that cannot be ignored.The impact of technological progress on medical science has been particularly significant, leading to increased life expectancy and better health outcomes. The development of vaccines and advanced treatments for previously incurable diseases has saved countless lives. Nevertheless, this progress has also contributed to overpopulation, intensified competition for resources, and subsequent environmental degradation and increased carbon emissions. Ironically, the technologies that have enabled humans to live longer are also contributing to existential threats such as climate change.Furthermore, technology has revolutionized communication and work environments, giving rise to remote work and global connectivity. While this has fostered collaboration and accessibility, it has also led to a blurring of the boundaries between personal and professional life. Many individuals are now experiencing increased stress and burnout due to constant connectivity, which has a negative impact on mental health. Social media, initially intended as a tool for connection, has been linked to increased isolation and anxiety among its users, particularly among younger generations.The rapid pace of automation also poses a significant threat to job security, as machines and algorithms replace human labor in various sectors. Although efficiency may increase, this transition creates economic instability and widens the gap between skilled and unskilled workers. The resulting unemployment and underemployment can lead to socioeconomic challenges and increased inequality.In conclusion, while technological progress has driven significant advancements that enhance the quality of life, it is essential to acknowledge the associated negative consequences. Finding a balance between embracing innovation and mitigating its adverse effects is crucial for creating a sustainable future for humanity. Therefore, I believe that the benefits of technology must be balanced with awareness and proactive measures to address its drawbacks, ensuring that the benefits of technological progress are realized while minimizing its negative impacts.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";For a long time, television has been a powerful influence on societal norms and behavior. The amount of violence shown on TV has caused a lot of debate about its effects on viewers, especially children and teenagers. I strongly believe that there is too much violence on TV and that it needs to be reduced.One of the main concerns about violent TV content is that it can make viewers less sensitive to violence. When people are constantly exposed to aggressive behavior on TV, it can make them more accepting of violence in real life. Research has shown that kids who watch violent TV shows are more likely to behave aggressively themselves, because they may start to think that violence is an okay way to solve problems. This can create a cycle where violence is seen as normal, and this can lead to harmful behaviors being passed down from one generation to the next.Furthermore, TV shows often focus on the excitement of violence without showing the real-life consequences that families and communities face. This can create a distorted view of reality, where violence is made to seem trivial and appealing. If TV shows reduced the amount of violence they depict, it could lead to more thoughtful storytelling that emphasizes empathy, problem-solving, and moral dilemmas. This would encourage viewers to think critically about complex issues, rather than just relying on simple and violent solutions to conflicts.It's also important to consider the role of the people who create TV content. They have a lot of power over what their audiences, especially young and impressionable viewers, watch. By choosing to limit violent content, creators can help create a healthier media environment that promotes positive behavior and understanding among viewers.In conclusion, while TV can be a fun and entertaining way to escape reality, the large amount of violence shown on TV is a cause for concern. Reducing violent content would not only help protect vulnerable viewers, but also promote a culture that values empathy and constructive conflict resolution over aggression. Ultimately, creating a more responsible media environment would benefit society as a whole.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The issue of arming police forces has sparked a heated debate, with opinions sharply divided on whether it contributes to higher levels of violence in society. Although some argue that armed police promote a culture of violence, I believe that the relationship between police arming and societal violence is complex and influenced by various contextual factors.Those who argue that armed police lead to increased violence often point to the potential for escalating confrontations. The presence of firearms can create a tense atmosphere, potentially leading to violent clashes. For example, in societies where police are perceived as heavily militarized, citizens may respond with hostility, fearing for their safety and autonomy, creating a cycle of heightened alertness among both police and civilians, which can lead to the escalation of non-lethal encounters into deadly confrontations.However, it is crucial to consider the role of armed police in maintaining public order. In areas with high crime rates, the presence of armed law enforcement can deter violence and crime by sending a clear message against illegal activities. Furthermore, properly trained and accountable armed police forces can respond to dangerous situations more effectively than unarmed police, potentially preventing violence in critical scenarios.The societal context also plays a significant role in shaping outcomes. In countries that prioritize police training, community relations, and accountability, the presence of armed police is often accompanied by a decrease in violence. In contrast, in societies plagued by corruption and lack of oversight, arming the police can exacerbate violence.In conclusion, while the concern that armed police may promote violence is valid, this issue is multifaceted and dependent on context. The effectiveness of armed police forces relies heavily on factors such as training, accountability, and broader societal dynamics. To effectively address and mitigate violence, a comprehensive approach that goes beyond simply arming the police is necessary.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";The debate about whether classmates have a greater impact on a child's academic success than parents is a multifaceted one. Although peers certainly have a significant influence during childhood and adolescence, I firmly believe that parents are the primary drivers of a child's academic achievements. There are several compelling reasons that support this perspective.Primarily, parents serve as a child's first and most influential educators and role models. They instill essential values, habits, and attitudes towards learning from a very young age. For instance, parents who prioritize education, read to their children, and engage them in learning activities lay the groundwork for a strong foundation in academics. This early support and guidance from parents cultivates a child's curiosity, fosters a love for learning, and significantly contributes to their future academic success.Furthermore, parents provide the emotional and financial backing that is crucial for a child's academic pursuits. They create a stable and nurturing environment that allows a child to flourish. Parents who encourage their children to participate in extracurricular activities, seek help when needed, and maintain a healthy balance between different aspects of life have a direct and positive impact on their children's academic performance. When children encounter academic challenges, it is often the guidance and support of their parents that helps them persevere, rather than the influence of their peers.On the contrary, while classmates can impact a child's social skills and motivation, this influence is often significantly moderated by the level of parental involvement. Children may seek approval and a sense of belonging from their peers, but this is largely influenced by the values and confidence that their parents have instilled in them. When children feel secure, supported, and valued at home, they are better equipped to handle peer pressure and stay focused on their academic goals.In conclusion, while classmates undoubtedly play a role in shaping a child's educational experience, parents remain the more significant influence on a child's academic success. The foundation established by parental support, involvement, and guidance is unparalleled in fostering a child's academic achievement, making it an irreplaceable component of their educational journey.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;The idea that living in large cities is bad for people's health is a complex issue that requires a thorough examination. Although there are strong arguments supporting this view, it's also essential to consider the potential advantages of urban living.One the one hand, big cities are often linked to various health problems. For instance, air pollution is a significant concern, as urban areas usually have higher levels of harmful pollutants due to traffic, industry, and construction. Long-term exposure to these pollutants can cause respiratory issues, heart diseases, and other health problems. Furthermore, the noise pollution in big cities can increase stress, disrupt sleep, and worsen mental health issues like anxiety and depression. The fast pace of city life can also lead to unhealthy habits, such as a poor diet, lack of exercise, and insufficient leisure time, which can have long-term effects on physical health.On the other hand, living in big cities can also offer several health benefits. Urban areas often have better access to healthcare facilities and specialized medical services. Residents can benefit from a wider range of health resources, including gyms, wellness programs, and mental health services. Moreover, cities often promote social interaction and community engagement, which are crucial for mental well-being. The public transportation and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure in cities can encourage active lifestyles, allowing residents to walk or cycle more often than those in rural areas.In conclusion, while the health risks of urban living, such as pollution and lifestyle factors, should not be ignored, it's also important to recognize the access to healthcare and opportunities for active living that big cities provide. Therefore, rather than simply agreeing that city living is bad for health, a balanced perspective is necessary, acknowledging both the challenges and advantages of urban environments.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;"The discussion about whether armed police forces exacerbate societal violence is intricate and has many layers. On one hand, some advocates for disarming the police believe that the mere presence of guns can heighten tensions in daily interactions, leading to a confrontational atmosphere instead of one built on trust and cooperation. This perspective is rooted in the idea that when police are armed, civilians may feel intimidated, and there are numerous instances where police interactions have turned violent, resulting in devastating outcomes, particularly in communities already dealing with systemic challenges.On the other hand, it's crucial to acknowledge the potential advantages of armed police forces. Firearms can act as a deterrent to violent crimes, thereby improving public safety. In areas with high crime rates, arming police officers may enable them to effectively manage armed criminals, potentially preventing violent clashes. Many proponents argue that, as trained professionals, police should be equipped to handle hazardous situations to safeguard both themselves and the public.Furthermore, the relationship between armed policing and heightened violence is not clear-cut. In certain countries where police are unarmed, violence still prevails, often driven by factors like socio-economic disparities and limited access to resources. Moreover, it's not solely the presence of firearms that generates violence; the broader social context, including systemic injustices and community trust, plays a pivotal role.In summary, although concerns about the potential for increased violence stemming from armed police forces are valid, it's an oversimplification to claim that carrying guns is the primary driver of societal violence. A more sophisticated approach is necessary, one that balances the need for public safety with community trust. Ultimately, fostering a culture of accountability, training, and engagement between law enforcement and civilians is essential for addressing violence, regardless of whether police officers are armed or not."
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;The development of a nation is significantly influenced by various factors, and education stands out as one of the most pivotal elements. By providing individuals with essential knowledge and skills, education enables them to contribute meaningfully to both the workforce and society. A population with a high level of education is crucial for achieving economic growth, ensuring social equity, and maintaining political stability.The direct impact of education on a nation's economic development cannot be overstated. A workforce that is well-educated is indispensable for driving innovation and enhancing productivity. There is a notable correlation between higher literacy rates and greater economic output, as educated populations are better equipped to harness technological advancements and optimize efficiency across various sectors. For example, countries like Finland and Japan, which prioritize significant investments in education, consistently rank among the top performers globally in terms of economic achievement. This underscores the role of education as a primary driver of economic stability and expansion.Beyond its economic benefits, education also plays a vital role in promoting social equity. By empowering marginalized communities and offering pathways for social mobility, education helps reduce inequality. Access to quality education increases the likelihood of individuals securing better employment opportunities, which in turn leads to improved living standards and a decrease in poverty levels. This aspect is especially critical in developing nations, where education can be a powerful instrument for breaking poverty cycles and advancing social justice.In addition to its economic and social benefits, education is fundamental to enhancing political stability and encouraging civic engagement. An educated and informed populace is more inclined to participate in democratic processes and hold their governments accountable. Education fosters critical thinking, encouraging individuals to question injustices and contribute to a more engaged and responsible citizenry.In summary, while factors such as governance, infrastructure, and natural resources are indeed important, education is unparalleled in its impact on a nation's development. Investing in education cultivates not only a skilled and productive workforce but also informed and engaged citizens capable of driving social change and fostering economic growth. Therefore, it is clear that education is the most critical factor in the development of a country, making it an indispensable investment for any nation seeking to advance and prosper.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";The concept of celebrity has undergone a significant transformation in modern society. Nowadays, public figures are often recognized more for their luxurious lifestyle, wealth, and personal choices rather than their actual accomplishments or contributions to the community. This change in perspective raises concerns about the impact on young people who look up to these individuals as role models.On the one hand, many celebrities gain fame due to their extravagant lifestyles rather than their talents or dedication to their craft. Reality TV stars, social media influencers, and some musicians and actors achieve fame through sensationalism rather than substantial achievements. This can create unrealistic expectations among young people, who may associate success with wealth and fame rather than hard work and perseverance. As a result, young individuals may feel pressured to pursue instant recognition through flashy lifestyles, neglecting the importance of hard work and resilience.Furthermore, the emphasis on wealth and glamour can perpetuate a culture that values material possessions and appearance over character and substance. As young people increasingly turn to social media for inspiration and guidance, they may be drawn to superficial indicators of success, such as likes, followers, and fame. This shift in values could lead to a generation that prioritizes personal branding and social status over genuine talent, hard work, and contributions to society.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that not all celebrities embody this phenomenon. Many use their platforms to raise awareness about important issues, inspire positive change, and promote artistic endeavors. These individuals demonstrate that fame and success can be coupled with meaningful achievements and positively impact society.In conclusion, while it is undeniable that many celebrities are celebrated for their wealth and glamour rather than their accomplishments, this trend poses significant risks to the values and aspirations of young people. It is crucial to promote a broader understanding of success that emphasizes hard work, talent, and ethical contributions to society. By balancing celebrity culture with critical analysis and media literacy, we can help cultivate a more sustainable and inspiring vision for future generations, one that values substance over superficiality and encourages young people to strive for meaningful achievements and positive impact.
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;The ongoing debate about the impact of technology, specifically mobile phones, on social interaction continues to be a topic of discussion in modern society. Although some people believe that mobile phones have a negative effect on personal relationships, I firmly believe that they improve social interaction by promoting communication, connectivity, and the exchange of experiences.The advent of mobile phones has transformed the way we communicate with one another. The emergence of instant messaging apps and social media platforms has enabled people to connect with friends and family, regardless of their geographical location. This effortless communication allows for more robust relationships, as individuals can share aspects of their lives through photos, messages, and video calls, fostering a sense of closeness even when physically apart. For example, family members residing in different countries can maintain regular contact, preserving relationships that might otherwise deteriorate due to distance.Furthermore, mobile technology has made it easier for people to form new relationships. Online communities and social networking sites provide opportunities for individuals with shared interests to connect, thereby broadening their social circles. People can find support groups, make new friends, and engage in discussions that may not be possible in their immediate surroundings. This expanded network can enhance one's social life and create opportunities for meaningful interactions.Critics often argue that the phenomenon of people being completely absorbed in their phones in social settings leads to a decline in face-to-face interaction. However, it is essential to acknowledge that this behavior is not an inherent result of mobile phones, but rather a reflection of how we choose to utilize technology. It is possible for individuals to find a balance between leveraging the benefits of mobile communication and remaining present in physical interactions.In conclusion, while mobile phones can occasionally disrupt in-person communication, they primarily serve as tools that enhance social interaction. By facilitating connections, enabling new friendships, and allowing for continuous engagement, mobile technology plays a vital role in enriching our social lives. Therefore, rather than viewing mobile phones solely as a negative influence, we should embrace their potential to connect us more deeply with others.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;The environmental problems currently plaguing the world, including climate change and biodiversity loss, are undoubtedly overwhelming. However, I argue that the idea that only governments and large corporations are responsible for addressing these issues is misguided, as it overlooks the significant impact that individual citizens can have in driving positive change.It is crucial to acknowledge the substantial influence and resources that governments and corporations possess in addressing environmental concerns. They have the power to shape policies, regulations, and industrial practices that can either harm or protect the environment. For example, government-led initiatives to reduce carbon emissions or preserve natural habitats are often essential in addressing these issues. Similarly, corporations have the capacity to adopt sustainable practices, develop eco-friendly technologies, and influence consumer behavior through their supply chains.Nonetheless, placing the sole responsibility for environmental improvement on these entities neglects the vital role that ordinary individuals can play in spearheading change. Individuals have the power to effect change within their local communities by promoting sustainable behaviors and inspiring others. Grassroots movements, such as community clean-ups, local recycling programs, and advocacy for environmentally conscious local policies, demonstrate the positive contributions individuals can make. When individuals make environmentally aware choices, such as reducing waste or supporting sustainable businesses, they send a potent message that can influence corporate practices and encourage governmental action.Furthermore, cultivating a culture of environmental awareness among individuals lays the groundwork for long-term, sustainable change. When citizens demand more sustainable policies and practices, it compels governments and corporations to reform. Thus, rather than perceiving responsibility as an either-or proposition between individuals and institutions, it should be viewed as a shared obligation.In summary, while governments and large corporations are instrumental in addressing environmental challenges, ordinary individuals also hold significant power to create meaningful, lasting change. It is through a collective effort that we can effectively and sustainably tackle the environmental challenges we face.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;"The depiction of crime in the media, including newspapers and television, is a highly debated topic, with valid arguments presented for both unrestricted reporting and the implementation of restrictions. The media's role in keeping the public informed is crucial, but the detailed portrayal of crimes can have detrimental effects on society, prompting the need for limitations on such information.One major concern is that the media's intense focus on crime can provoke increased fear and anxiety among community members. The emphasis on violent acts and the sensationalization of crime can create an exaggerated perception of crime rates, leading to what is known as the ""mean world syndrome."" This phenomenon contributes to heightened societal paranoia, erosion of trust, and strained community relationships. As a result, individuals may take unnecessary precautions, leading to further isolation and decreased community engagement.Furthermore, explicit crime depictions and detailed crime accounts can desensitize the public to violence. Prolonged exposure to brutal crime stories can render audiences indifferent to the consequences of violence, resulting in diminished empathy for victims and a normalization of violent behavior. This desensitization can also influence behavior, particularly among impressionable young individuals, who may begin to perceive criminal actions as acceptable or even desirable.However, it is essential to acknowledge the media's function as a watchdog, keeping the public informed about pressing societal issues. Restricting access to information could hinder transparency and the ability to hold institutions accountable for their actions.In conclusion, while the media plays a vital role in society, the consequences of detailed crime reporting warrant careful consideration. A balance must be struck between the public's right to information and the potential negative societal impacts of sensationalized crime reporting. This balance could be achieved through the implementation of guidelines that promote responsible journalism, ultimately fostering a community that is both informed and safe."
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;The importance of teaching handwriting skills to children has become a topic of increasing debate in recent times. Although technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, I firmly believe that handwriting remains a crucial skill that should be taught to children for several compelling reasons.One of the primary reasons is that handwriting plays a vital role in cognitive development. Studies have shown that writing by hand activates different parts of the brain compared to typing, which enhances information retention and comprehension. Mastering handwriting improves fine motor skills, boosts memory, and stimulates creativity - benefits that cannot be fully replicated by typing alone. This highlights the significance of incorporating handwriting into early childhood education.Moreover, handwritten communication adds a personal touch that is often lacking in digital correspondence. In a world where emails and instant messaging dominate, a handwritten note or letter can convey a sense of thoughtfulness and genuineness. The ability to express oneself through handwriting is an essential social skill that retains its value, particularly in personal and professional relationships where conveying emotions and sincerity is crucial.The importance of handwriting in academic settings, such as examinations, should not be underestimated. While digital tools are widely used, the ability to write legibly and coherently by hand remains a necessary skill in many educational systems. Handwritten exam responses can demonstrate a student's understanding and critical thinking abilities, and the capacity to organize thoughts on paper is vital for developing effective communication skills.In addition to its practical applications, handwriting also has a creative aspect that should not be overlooked. An individual's unique writing style can be a significant aspect of their personal identity, fostering self-esteem and a sense of ownership over their work.In conclusion, despite the growing reliance on technology, I strongly argue that teaching handwriting is still essential. It serves not only practical purposes but also supports cognitive development, social interaction, and personal expression. Therefore, it is crucial for educational curricula to maintain a focus on handwriting skills to ensure the holistic development of children.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";The question of whether families who opt for private education should be exempt from paying taxes that fund the public education system is a multifaceted issue, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. Although there are reasonable points to support the idea of tax exemption for these families, I firmly believe that they should not be exempt from contributing to the public education system.First and foremost, public education is the foundation of a democratic society, and it is financed through collective taxation to ensure that every child has access to basic educational resources, regardless of their family's financial situation. The purpose of this system is to promote equality, foster social unity, and provide opportunities for those who cannot afford private education. Exempting private school families from education taxes would likely lead to a substantial reduction in public school funding, which would further strain a system that is already underfunded and exacerbate socioeconomic disparities.Furthermore, families who choose private education still benefit from the social infrastructure provided by public education. A well-educated population contributes to the economy, societal welfare, and civic engagement, all of which indirectly support all families, regardless of the type of school their children attend. This shared benefit creates a collective responsibility to support a well-educated society, where all children can thrive, regardless of the school they attend.Proponents of tax exemption argue that it is unfair to require private school families to contribute to a system they do not use. While this argument may seem logical, it neglects the broader societal implications and the crucial role of robust public education in supporting all members of society. Instead of tax exemption, alternative solutions such as voucher programs or scholarships could provide more equitable access to education without compromising the public education funding system.In conclusion, the decision to send children to private schools is a personal choice, but it should not excuse families from contributing to the public education system. A well-funded and accessible education system has far-reaching benefits that extend beyond individual families, positively impacting the community and society as a whole.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;The claim that government funding for the arts, including music and theater, is a frivolous expense compared to essential public services like healthcare and education, is a topic of debate. Although it is clear that public services are vital for the functioning of society, disregarding the importance of the arts ignores their substantial contributions to cultural, economic, and social development.There are several reasons why investing in the arts is crucial. Firstly, the arts have a profound impact on mental health and well-being. Participating in or simply enjoying artistic activities has been proven to decrease stress, alleviate symptoms of depression, and foster a sense of community. This was especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, when arts and entertainment provided comfort and a sense of normalcy. As a result, investing in the arts can be seen as a proactive measure that may lead to long-term savings in healthcare costs.Furthermore, the arts make significant economic contributions. The creative industries create employment opportunities, attract tourists, and boost local economies. For instance, cities known for their cultural attractions often see an increase in foot traffic and business for local shops and restaurants. According to a UK government report, every pound invested in arts organizations generates around four pounds in economic returns. This highlights the multifaceted economic benefits of funding the arts, which can increase public revenue.Lastly, the arts facilitate important discussions about societal issues, promoting an informed and engaged citizenry. They provide a platform for underrepresented voices and encourage empathy and understanding between different communities. Consequently, investing in the arts can enhance social cohesion, which in turn strengthens the fabric of society.In summary, while investing in public services is essential, labeling government spending on the arts as a waste of money overlooks their inherent value. A balanced approach that supports both the arts and public services is necessary for creating a vibrant and resilient society. Therefore, I argue that investing in the arts is not only justified but essential for the holistic development of society.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;"The swift progress of technology has profoundly impacted human society, influencing communication, education, and everyday life. However, this transformation has sparked concerns about the potential erosion of traditional cultures, prompting a heated debate about the compatibility of technological advancements with cultural conservation. Although it is true that technology can overshadow and erode traditional customs, I contend that cultural loss is not an inevitable consequence; instead, technology can be a potent instrument for the revitalization and preservation of these cultures.One of the primary methods by which technology poses a threat to traditional cultures is through globalization, where dominant cultures can overshadow local customs. The widespread adoption of social media and digital platforms often promotes a uniform set of values, aesthetics, and lifestyles, which can lead to the marginalization of indigenous and traditional cultures. As younger generations embrace global trends, there is a legitimate concern that their ancestral customs, languages, and rituals may be lost over time.Nonetheless, it is vital to acknowledge that technology can also play a pivotal role in preserving cultural heritage. For example, digital archives and platforms can facilitate the documentation of endangered languages and customs, rendering them more accessible to future generations. Initiatives such as virtual reality experiences and online storytelling enable users to engage with and appreciate diverse cultures from anywhere in the world, thereby fostering respect and understanding. Furthermore, social media can empower marginalized communities to share their stories and traditions, prompting a resurgence of cultural pride and identity.In conclusion, while technological advancements present challenges to traditional cultures, they also offer numerous opportunities for preservation and revitalization. It is essential for societies to strike a balance between embracing technological innovation and safeguarding their cultural legacy. By proactively harnessing technology, we can promote the coexistence of modernity and tradition, ensuring that cultural diversity flourishes in an increasingly interconnected world."
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;The issue of whether universities should implement equal admissions policies for male and female students across all disciplines is a multifaceted problem that involves considerations of equality, merit-based admissions, and societal requirements. Although striving for gender parity in education is a laudable goal, the method of enforcing equal numbers of male and female students raises several issues.One the one hand, promoting equal representation in higher education can contribute to breaking down long-standing stereotypes and prejudices that have historically discriminated against women, particularly in fields that have traditionally been male-dominated, such as computer science and engineering. Ensuring equal numbers of male and female students can create a more balanced learning environment that fosters collaboration, and diverse viewpoints that improve learning outcomes. Moreover, given the persisting gender disparities in many fields, a policy of equal admissions could help to create a more level playing field, and encourage more women to pursue careers in areas where they have been underrepresented.On the other hand, enforcing equal admissions numbers could compromise the principle of merit-based admissions. University admissions should be primarily based on a student's qualifications, aptitude, and passion for a subject, rather than their gender. Implementing equal representation quotas in every discipline could lead to situations where less qualified applicants are accepted based on their gender, which could ultimately undermine the academic rigor, and quality of university programs. Additionally, the differing levels of interest in certain subjects among genders - as exemplified by the disparities in applications to engineering versus nursing programs - suggest that imposing equal admissions numbers may not accurately reflect actual interest, or capability.In conclusion, while achieving gender balance in higher education is crucial, it is essential to adopt a nuanced approach that balances competing considerations. Rather than enforcing strict equal admissions numbers across all subjects, universities should focus on promoting participation, and supporting initiatives that foster gender diversity, thereby ensuring that both merit, and equality can coexist without compromising academic standards.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;The impact of celebrity media coverage on children has become a topic of growing concern in today's society. Many people believe that the constant portrayal of celebrity lifestyles in the media can have a harmful effect on young viewers. I share this view, as the way celebrities are represented in the media can negatively influence the values, aspirations, and behaviors of children.The constant exposure to idealized images of celebrities can create unrealistic expectations about beauty, success, and lifestyle. Children, who are often easily influenced and still forming their identities, may adopt these ideals and feel they need to imitate these celebrities to be accepted or valued. This can lead to problems such as low self-esteem, distorted body image, and a narrow understanding of success that is only associated with fame or wealth.Furthermore, the media often presents glamorous or sensationalized content that may encourage negative behaviors in children. There are many examples of celebrities engaging in risky behaviors like substance abuse, provocative actions, or displaying excessive materialism. When the media celebrates these behaviors, children may see them as desirable and try to imitate them, potentially leading to the normalization of such behaviors in their own lives.It's worth noting, however, that not all celebrity media coverage is harmful. Some celebrities use their platforms to promote positive social change, support good causes, and spread beneficial messages. In these cases, children can certainly benefit from these positive role models. Nevertheless, the widespread negative portrayal of celebrities tends to overshadow these positive examples.In summary, while celebrity culture can provide positive role models for children, the dominant negative media coverage can significantly damage the values and self-image of young audiences. Therefore, it's crucial for parents, educators, and society as a whole to critically evaluate media consumption and guide children towards more positive and uplifting representations and messages.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The adage ""prevention is better than cure"" holds significant weight in the domain of public health, suggesting that allocating resources to health education and preventative measures yields better results than treating illnesses after they arise. I firmly believe that a substantial portion of a nation's health expenditure should be redirected from treatment to proactive health initiatives.Initially, preventative measures like vaccination programs, regular check-ups, and public health campaigns lead to a notable decrease in disease incidence. These initiatives enhance overall health outcomes and also ease the financial strain on healthcare systems. For example, immunization against diseases such as measles or influenza can prevent outbreaks, resulting in significant savings in treatment costs while also improving community well-being. By allocating funds to such preventative strategies, nations can decrease the frequency and severity of health emergencies, ultimately fostering a healthier populace.Furthermore, health education empowers individuals to make well-informed decisions about their lifestyle, promoting awareness about nutrition, physical activity, and the dangers of smoking or excessive drinking. By doing so, we cultivate a culture of health awareness, diminishing the risk factors associated with chronic diseases. A well-informed public is better equipped to adopt proactive health behaviors, leading to a decrease in healthcare demands and expenditures.Nonetheless, it's essential to acknowledge that treatment will always be necessary, as some diseases cannot be prevented. Therefore, a balanced approach is vital, where funding for treatment is prioritized for acute illnesses and emergencies, yet not at the expense of preventative measures. A harmonized strategy emphasizing prevention can lead to long-term healthcare savings and enhance the quality of life for populations.In conclusion, allocating a larger portion of health budgets to health education and prevention is not just a practical approach, but also a moral obligation. By prioritizing prevention, societies can anticipate healthier populations, reduced healthcare costs, and a more sustainable healthcare system overall."
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;The importance of fatherhood should be recognized and valued equally with motherhood, as acknowledging the equal significance of both parents is vital for a well-rounded understanding of family dynamics and the distribution of childcare responsibilities. Traditionally, societal expectations have placed a disproportionate burden of parenting responsibilities on mothers, perpetuating the misconception that women alone are accountable for decisions related to pregnancy and childcare. This not only diminishes the role of fathers but also reinforces outdated gender stereotypes that are harmful to both parents and children.It is crucial to recognize that parenting is a joint responsibility. The participation of fathers in decision-making processes regarding family planning and childcare is essential for the healthy development of a child. Studies have demonstrated that children greatly benefit from having involved fathers who are actively engaged in their lives. Positive relationships between fathers and children contribute to emotional stability, social skills, and overall well-being, making it clear that fatherhood is just as vital as motherhood.Furthermore, emphasizing the importance of fatherhood can help eradicate the stigma associated with men who want to take on primary caregiving roles. As societal norms evolve, many fathers are embracing their roles as caregivers and are actively involved in the early development of their children. This shift challenges traditional gender roles and supports a more equitable distribution of parenting responsibilities.Additionally, a focus on fatherhood promotes a more inclusive understanding of diverse family structures. With the variety of family models existing today, recognizing the importance of all caregivers - whether they are fathers, mothers, or other relatives - ensures that children receive the necessary support for healthy growth and development.In summary, to foster a more balanced perspective on parenting, it is essential to emphasize the significance of fatherhood alongside motherhood. Societal recognition of the importance of both parents in childcare is not only crucial for the developmental outcomes of children but also for promoting a culture that values partnership, shared responsibility, and equality in family life.
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.;The notion that children should prioritize academic studies over sports, and that time spent on physical activities is wasted, is a highly debated topic. Although academic success is essential for future prospects, downplaying the importance of sports neglects the comprehensive development of children.Academic education is undeniably vital, as it provides children with fundamental knowledge and skills necessary for future accomplishments in higher education and their careers. Nevertheless, this viewpoint often neglects the extensive benefits that sports and physical activities bring to a child's development. Participating in sports helps children develop valuable life skills, including collaboration, discipline, leadership, and perseverance, which may not be fully developed in a traditional classroom setting. These skills are essential for both personal and professional growth.Furthermore, physical well-being is a crucial aspect of overall health. Engaging in sports on a regular basis helps combat the growing issue of childhood obesity and establishes lifelong habits of physical fitness. Children who participate in sports experience improved focus and cognitive function, which can enhance their academic performance. Research indicates that students who balance their academic efforts with physical activities tend to achieve better overall results.Moreover, sports offer a vital outlet for stress relief and emotional expression, providing a necessary break from the pressures of academic life and promoting mental health and emotional stability.In conclusion, while academic dedication is undoubtedly essential, viewing sports as a waste of time overlooks their significant contributions to a child's development. A balance between academics and physical activity fosters well-rounded individuals, preparing them for future careers and life in general. Therefore, rather than perceiving sports as a distraction, we should recognize them as a vital complement to academic learning, promoting a holistic approach to child development.
