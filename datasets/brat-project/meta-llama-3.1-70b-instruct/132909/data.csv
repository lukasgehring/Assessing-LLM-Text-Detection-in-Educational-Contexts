0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;The debate between competition and cooperation has been a longstanding one, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. While competition can undoubtedly drive innovation and promote economic growth, I firmly believe that cooperation is the more desirable approach, particularly in the context of childhood development.On the surface, competition appears to be a catalyst for progress. It pushes individuals to strive for excellence, innovate, and improve, ultimately leading to economic growth and advancement. However, when we delve deeper into the issue, it becomes apparent that the benefits of competition are largely outweighed by the drawbacks. In a competitive environment, individuals are pitted against one another, fostering a sense of rivalry and aggression.In contrast, cooperation offers a myriad of benefits, particularly for children. Through collaborative activities and teamwork, children can develop essential interpersonal skills, such as communication, empathy, and problem-solving. These skills are crucial in shaping their future lives, as they will be required to navigate complex social situations, build strong relationships, and work effectively in teams.Furthermore, cooperation promotes a sense of community and mutual support, allowing children to feel safe, valued, and motivated to contribute. This, in turn, fosters a positive and inclusive environment, where children can grow and thrive. In contrast, competition can lead to feelings of isolation, anxiety, and low self-esteem, ultimately hindering a child's emotional and social development.In conclusion, while competition may have its advantages in driving economic growth, I firmly believe that cooperation is the more desirable approach, particularly in the context of childhood development. By promoting cooperation, we can help children develop essential interpersonal skills, foster a sense of community, and create a positive and inclusive environment that allows them to thrive.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;The last 50 years have witnessed a significant surge in the number of immigrants moving to foreign countries. This phenomenon has sparked a heated debate on how these individuals can successfully integrate into their adopted societies. While some argue that immigrants should assimilate into the local culture, abandoning their native customs and traditions, I firmly believe that maintaining their cultural identity is essential for their well-being and contribution to their new societies.When immigrants preserve their cultural heritage, they are able to hold on to their core values and beliefs, which are often deeply rooted in their traditions. This helps them maintain a strong sense of self and connection to their community, providing a sense of comfort and belonging in an unfamiliar environment. Furthermore, by sustaining their cultural identities, immigrants can enrich their adopted countries with diverse perspectives, customs, and practices. This diversity can lead to a more vibrant and inclusive society, where different cultures coexist and thrive.Moreover, maintaining one's cultural identity is crucial for successful integration. When immigrants feel confident in their cultural roots, they are more likely to engage with their new community, form meaningful connections, and contribute to the local culture. This, in turn, fosters mutual understanding and respect between different cultural groups, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and multicultural society.In conclusion, while some may argue that immigrants should abandon their cultural identities to fit in, I firmly believe that maintaining one's cultural heritage is essential for successful integration and a key factor in creating a rich and inclusive multicultural environment. By embracing their origins, immigrants can not only preserve their values but also enrich their adopted societies, leading to a brighter and more diverse future for all.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;The past decade has witnessed a significant surge in international tourism, with millions of travelers flocking to experience the world's natural wonders, ancient heritages, and diverse cultures. While some may argue that this influx of tourists has detrimental effects on destination countries, I firmly believe that international tourism has had a profoundly positive impact on both the economic development and cultural preservation of these regions.On the economic front, tourism has proven to be a lucrative industry, generating substantial revenue for local economies. The influx of tourists creates a demand for goods and services, stimulating local businesses and creating employment opportunities. In many developing countries, tourism has become a vital sector, contributing significantly to GDP and helping to alleviate poverty. For instance, countries like Thailand and Costa Rica have seen a significant boost in their economies due to tourism, with the sector accounting for a substantial percentage of their national income.Moreover, tourism has also played a crucial role in preserving the cultural heritage and natural environment of destination countries. The revenue generated from tourism has enabled local authorities to invest in conservation efforts, protecting ancient sites and natural wonders for future generations. For example, the tourism industry has helped to preserve the ancient city of Petra in Jordan, while also supporting the conservation of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Additionally, tourism has promoted cross-cultural exchange, fostering greater understanding and appreciation between tourists and local communities.In conclusion, while some may argue that international tourism has negative effects on destination countries, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. By contributing to economic development and preserving cultural heritage and the environment, tourism has become an indispensable sector for many countries around the world.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;The past 50 years have witnessed a phenomenal growth in the number of tourists traveling worldwide. This unprecedented surge has brought numerous benefits to local economies and cultures, but it also poses a significant threat to the very essence of these destinations. The influx of tourists has put a strain on the environment, infrastructure, and cultural heritage of these places, and if authorities do not take steps to conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.The exponential growth of tourism has led to the degradation of natural habitats, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. Popular tourist spots are often plagued by litter, erosion, and the destruction of natural beauty. Furthermore, the strain on local infrastructure has resulted in the displacement of native communities, as hotels and resorts are built to accommodate the influx of visitors.Moreover, the cultural heritage of these destinations is also under threat. The commercialization of local customs and traditions has led to the erosion of their authenticity, and the homogenization of unique cultural practices. The influx of tourists has also led to the displacement of local artisans, as mass-produced souvenirs flood the markets.If authorities do not take steps to mitigate these effects, the very essence of these destinations will be destroyed. It is imperative that sustainable tourism practices are implemented, which prioritize the conservation of natural and cultural heritage. This can be achieved through measures such as regulated tourism, eco-tourism, and the promotion of local artisans and communities.Ultimately, it is the responsibility of authorities to ensure that the tourism industry is managed in a way that preserves the beauty and uniqueness of these destinations for future generations. By taking proactive steps to conserve these precious values, we can ensure that the benefits of tourism are balanced with the need to protect the environment and cultural heritage.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;The decision to study abroad has become a pivotal moment in the lives of many students. While some may prefer the comfort and familiarity of studying at home, others opt to take the leap and venture into foreign lands to pursue their academic dreams. In my opinion, studying overseas offers a multitude of benefits that far outweigh the difficulties of living and studying abroad.First and foremost, studying abroad provides students with the opportunity to immerse themselves in a new culture. By living and learning in a foreign environment, students are able to broaden their cultural understanding, challenge their own biases, and develop a more nuanced worldview. This cultural immersion also allows students to develop valuable language skills, as they navigate everyday situations in a foreign language. Furthermore, interacting with people from diverse backgrounds fosters empathy, adaptability, and open-mindedness, all of which are essential skills in today's interconnected world.In addition to cultural immersion, studying abroad also presents students with a chance to develop their independence and self-reliance. Living in a foreign country requires students to take responsibility for their daily lives, from managing finances to navigating unfamiliar transportation systems. This independence enables students to build confidence, develop problem-solving skills, and learn to rely on themselves. Moreover, the experience of studying abroad also enhances a student's employability, as it demonstrates to potential employers their ability to adapt to new situations and think outside the box.While it is true that studying abroad can be challenging, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the difficulties. By studying overseas, students gain valuable skills such as cultural competence, language proficiency, independence, and adaptability. These skills not only enhance their academic and professional prospects but also prepare them to thrive in an increasingly globalized world.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;The experience of studying abroad is a transformative one, offering students a wealth of benefits that extend far beyond the academic realm. On a personal level, living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability, qualities that are essential for success in today's increasingly globalized world. By navigating the challenges of everyday life in an unfamiliar environment, students develop resilience, independence, and a greater sense of self-awareness.Academically, studying abroad provides students with access to new and innovative teaching methods, cutting-edge research facilities, and a diverse range of academic programs. This exposure broadens students' perspectives, fosters creativity, and enables them to develop a more nuanced understanding of their chosen field of study. Furthermore, the opportunity to engage with international scholars and peers from diverse backgrounds enriches the learning experience, allowing students to tap into a global network of knowledge and expertise.Culturally, studying abroad offers students a unique chance to immerse themselves in a new and unfamiliar culture. By experiencing different customs, traditions, and ways of life, students gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity of human experience and develop a more empathetic worldview. This cultural immersion also enables students to develop valuable language skills, as they learn to communicate effectively in a new linguistic context.In conclusion, the experience of studying abroad is a multifaceted one, offering students a wide range of benefits that extend far beyond the academic realm. By developing personal flexibility and adaptability, accessing new academic experiences, and immersing themselves in a new culture, students can gain a truly transformative education that prepares them for success in an increasingly interconnected world.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The internet has revolutionized the way people access information in recent years. As a result, the popularity of traditional newspapers has been dwindling. While some believe that newspapers can continue to exist for a long time, others disagree, arguing that they have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence.The primary advantage of the internet is its ability to provide instant access to vast amounts of information. With just a few clicks, users can obtain the latest news, updates, and trends from around the world. In contrast, newspapers are limited by their print format and require a significant amount of time to research, write, and publish articles. Furthermore, the internet offers a wide range of sources, allowing users to cross-check information and verify facts, whereas newspapers often rely on a single perspective or viewpoint.Another significant advantage of the internet is its convenience. With the rise of mobile devices and smartphones, people can access the internet anywhere, at any time. This is particularly useful for busy individuals who may not have the time to sit down and read a newspaper. In contrast, newspapers require a physical presence and can be cumbersome to carry around.In conclusion, while some people may still believe that newspapers have a place in modern society, it is clear that the internet has become the primary source of information for many people. The speed, convenience, and vast array of sources available online have made it the go-to medium for news and information. As technology continues to evolve and improve, it is likely that the popularity of newspapers will continue to decline, making it increasingly difficult for them to sustain their existence.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";The cornerstone of a civilized society is education, and it plays a pivotal role in a country's long-term prosperity. Education is a vital investment in the future of any nation, and governments should prioritize both early childhood education and higher education, particularly universities.On one hand, early childhood education lays the foundation for future generations. It is essential to nurture young minds with essential skills, values, and knowledge to prepare them for a rapidly changing world. Governments should allocate adequate resources to ensure that all children have access to quality education from a young age, setting them up for success in their future endeavors. By doing so, they will be able to contribute meaningfully to society, fostering a more informed, tolerant, and civic-minded population.On the other hand, universities are critical in cultivating innovation, research, and expertise, which drive economic growth, technological advancements, and societal progress. Universities are hubs for intellectual exploration, creativity, and critical thinking, where students can develop their skills and knowledge to tackle complex challenges. By investing in universities, governments can create a pool of skilled and educated individuals who can drive progress in various fields, from science and technology to arts and humanities.Some may argue that universities can sustain themselves through donations or innovative ventures, thereby alleviating the need for government support. However, this argument is flawed. While private funding can certainly supplement university resources, it is unlikely to fully replace government funding. Moreover, relying solely on private funding can lead to unequal access to education, as some institutions may receive more funding than others, creating a disparity in educational opportunities.In conclusion, education is the backbone of a civilized society, and governments should prioritize both early childhood education and universities to ensure a brighter future. By investing in education, governments can foster a more informed, innovative, and prosperous society, where individuals can thrive and contribute meaningfully.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";When it comes to sharing a living space with others, having good roommates can make all the difference in creating a harmonious and comfortable environment. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considerate. Considerate roommates respect each other's space, belongings, and boundaries, which is essential for maintaining a positive and peaceful living atmosphere. When roommates are considerate, they are mindful of noise levels, clean up after themselves, and avoid imposing their lifestyle on others. This thoughtful behavior fosters a sense of trust and mutual respect, making it easier to resolve conflicts and communicate effectively.In the meantime, communication is another essential particularity of a good roommate. Effective communication is key to resolving conflicts, expressing needs and concerns, and building a strong relationship. When roommates communicate openly and honestly, they can address issues before they escalate into bigger problems. Good communication also helps to prevent misunderstandings and promotes a sense of teamwork and cooperation. For instance, discussing and agreeing on household chores, guest policies, and financial responsibilities can prevent resentment and promote a sense of shared responsibility.Furthermore, considerate and communicative roommates are more likely to be empathetic and understanding. They can put themselves in their roommate's shoes and appreciate their perspectives, which helps to create a supportive and inclusive living environment. In conclusion, having considerate and communicative roommates is crucial for creating a harmonious and comfortable living space. By being respectful, open, and honest with each other, roommates can build strong relationships, resolve conflicts effectively, and enjoy a positive and supportive living environment.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change and urbanization, governments must prioritize investments that promote sustainable transportation systems. One crucial area of focus should be on buses, trains, and subways. These public transportation systems are essential in alleviating traffic congestion, reducing carbon emissions, and protecting the environment.The benefits of investing in buses, trains, and subways are multifaceted. Firstly, they provide an efficient and reliable means of transportation for millions of people, reducing the reliance on personal vehicles and subsequent traffic congestion. According to the American Public Transportation Association, public transportation can reduce travel times by up to 50%, making commutes faster and more convenient. By encouraging the use of public transportation, governments can decrease the number of cars and motorbikes on the road, resulting in lower emissions and improved air quality.Furthermore, the environmental impact of increased public transportation investment is significant. The transportation sector is responsible for nearly 30% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States alone. By transitioning to cleaner modes of transportation, governments can reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the damage to the ozone layer. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, investing in public transportation can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 5 gigatons annually, equivalent to taking 1.2 billion cars off the road.Investing in buses, trains, and subways is a critical step towards creating sustainable cities and reducing our carbon footprint. Governments must prioritize public transportation infrastructure to provide citizens with efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly transportation options. By doing so, we can create healthier, more livable cities and mitigate the devastating impacts of climate change.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";**The Correlation Between Physical Exercise and Health: A Pathway to Sustainability**Regular physical exercise is a vital component of a healthy lifestyle, and its benefits extend far beyond the individual to encompass the broader society. A direct linkage exists between people's health and the frequency of engaging in physical activities. The more we practice, the better we feel, both physically and mentally. This, in turn, has a positive impact on various aspects of our lives, including financial sustainability.Engaging in physical exercise, whether outdoors or indoors, has numerous advantages.

Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.;The advent of modern technology has revolutionized numerous aspects of our lives, transforming the way we communicate, access information, and innovate. One of the most beneficial results of this technological advancements is email, which has revolutionized the way people connect and exchange information.Prior to the invention of email, communication over long distances was a laborious and time-consuming process. Letters had to be physically mailed, and responses often took weeks or even months to arrive. With the advent of email, this process has been streamlined, enabling individuals to send and receive messages instantly, regardless of their geographical location. This has had a profound impact on various sectors, including education.For instance, students can now apply for foreign universities much easier than before.

As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more groundbreaking innovations that will further transform our world.
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;The impact of technology on children's creativity has been a topic of debate in recent years. While some people argue that technology has made children less creative, I firmly believe that technology has a profound positive influence on children's creativity and knowledge.On one hand, technology has been criticized for its potential to stifle creativity in children. Some argue that the abundance of digital tools and apps can lead to a reliance on pre-made templates and ideas, rather than encouraging children to think outside the box and come up with their own unique concepts. However, I do not deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I strongly believe that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks.On the other hand, technology inspires children to create new things. Digital tools such as graphic design software, video editing apps, and coding programs provide children with endless possibilities to express their creativity and bring their ideas to life. For example, a child can use a computer program to design and build their own virtual city, or create a stop-motion animation video using a tablet and a few simple materials. Technology has opened up a world of creative possibilities for children, allowing them to explore and experiment with different forms of art and self-expression.Secondly, technology widens children's knowledge. The internet provides children with access to a vast array of educational resources, including online encyclopedias, educational websites, and virtual museums. Children can now learn about different cultures, historical events, and scientific concepts with just a few clicks of a mouse. Technology has made it possible for children to learn at their own pace, exploring topics that interest them and expanding their knowledge in a fun and engaging way.In conclusion, while technology may have some negative effects on children, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. Technology inspires children to create new things and widens their knowledge, making it an essential tool in their cognitive and creative development.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;The debate on whether students learn more from teachers or through other means has been ongoing. While some argue that students can acquire knowledge through various sources, many people still believe that students at schools and universities learn significantly more from lessons with teachers.One of the primary reasons for this is that teachers have been instrumental in teaching students the fundamental skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic since they were in kindergarten. These foundational skills are essential for academic success and are often learned through the guidance and instruction of teachers. From phonetics and basic addition to complex literary analysis and calculus, teachers have been the cornerstone of education, providing students with the tools they need to navigate the academic landscape.Moreover, teachers play a vital role in shaping the moral compass of students. They not only impart knowledge but also instill values and principles that help students distinguish right from wrong. Through classroom discussions, role-playing, and real-life examples, teachers help students develop critical thinking skills, empathy, and a sense of responsibility. This moral education is essential for students to become well-rounded individuals who can contribute positively to society.While it is true that students can learn from other sources, such as books, online resources, and experiences, the role of teachers cannot be overstated. Teachers provide personalized guidance, feedback, and support that are difficult to replicate through other means. They create a nurturing environment that encourages students to ask questions, explore ideas, and learn from their mistakes.In conclusion, many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. Through their instruction, guidance, and mentorship, teachers equip students with the skills, knowledge, and values necessary for academic success and personal growth. While other sources of learning are important, the role of teachers remains indispensable in shaping the minds and characters of future generations.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;The advent of email and text messaging has revolutionized the way people communicate, bringing about significant changes in the way we convey and receive information. While these technological advancements have made communication faster and more convenient, some individuals have expressed concerns that they may be contributing to the decline of written language. As we navigate this digital age, it is imperative that educators and individuals, particularly the youth, pay attention to this issue and take steps to preserve the importance of written communication.The rise of email and text messaging has led to a shift away from traditional forms of written communication, such as letter writing and journaling. This shift has resulted in a decline in the amount of time people spend engaging in written communication, which can have a negative impact on writing skills and literacy. Furthermore, the brevity and informality of email and text messaging can lead to a lack of attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which are essential skills for effective written communication.Despite these concerns, it is essential that we recognize the value of written communication and take steps to preserve it. Educators play a crucial role in this process, as they can incorporate writing activities into their curricula and encourage students to engage in writing for both personal and academic purposes. Individuals, particularly the youth, must also take responsibility for maintaining their writing skills, as they are the future communicators of our society.By paying attention to this issue and taking steps to preserve written communication, we can ensure that the benefits of email and text messaging do not come at the expense of our ability to communicate effectively through writing. As we continue to navigate the digital age, it is essential that we prioritize the importance of written language and take steps to preserve it for future generations.
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";The use of animal experimentation has been a topic of intense debate in recent years, with increasing numbers of tests being conducted for the development of new medicines and foods. While some opponents argue that such practices are cruel to animals and nature, I firmly believe that animal testing is a necessary evil that ensures the safety and efficacy of these products for human consumption.On one hand, it is undeniable that animal testing can be a cruel and inhumane practice. Many animals are subjected to painful and distressing procedures, often resulting in their death or disability. Furthermore, the use of animals in scientific research can be seen as a disruption to the natural balance of the ecosystem. However, I believe that these concerns must be weighed against the potential risks to human health and wellbeing if these products are not thoroughly tested.The alternative to animal testing is to conduct tests on humans, which would be morally and ethically unacceptable. The consequences of releasing untested medicines and foods into the market would be catastrophic, resulting in countless human suffering and loss of life. It is our responsibility to ensure that any product intended for human consumption is safe and effective, and animal testing is currently the most reliable method of achieving this goal.In conclusion, while animal testing is undoubtedly a cruel practice, I believe that it is a necessary one. The potential risks to humanity if we do not test these products on animals far outweigh the concerns about animal welfare. As our understanding of science and technology advances, perhaps one day we will find alternative methods to animal testing. Until then, I believe that animal testing is a regrettable but essential part of the scientific process.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;The vast majority of people do not have a plan in place to limit or schedule their television viewing. Despite the enjoyment that comes from watching television shows, it is a time-consuming task that can have several negative consequences. This essay will discuss the effects of excessive television viewing, including its impact on productivity, laziness, and the promotion of negative activities.First and foremost, watching television is a significant time commitment. On average, people spend several hours a day watching their favorite shows, which can lead to a substantial loss of productivity. If people had a plan in place to limit their viewing, they could allocate that time to more beneficial activities such as exercise, reading, or spending time with loved ones. Moreover, excessive television viewing can make individuals lazy, as they spend more time sitting on the couch, rather than engaging in physical activity or pursuing hobbies.Another concerning issue with watching television is the promotion of negative activities. Some television programs, particularly those that glamorize criminal behavior, can have a detrimental influence on viewers. These shows can desensitize individuals to the consequences of criminal activity and even encourage them to engage in similar behavior. Furthermore, the constant exposure to violence, crime, and other negative themes can lead to a distorted view of reality, making it more challenging for people to differentiate between right and wrong.In conclusion, it is essential for people to establish a plan to limit their television viewing. By doing so, they can free up time for more productive activities, avoid the pitfalls of laziness, and reduce their exposure to negative influences. By being mindful of their viewing habits, individuals can promote a healthier and more balanced lifestyle.
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;The issue of gender equality in university admissions has been a longstanding debate. While some argue that universities should prioritize academic merit, others believe that accepting equal numbers of male and female students is essential for promoting diversity and challenging gender stereotypes. In this essay, we will discuss why universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders.Women have made tremendous strides in various fields, proving their capabilities and potential. From medicine and engineering to sports and politics, women have shattered glass ceilings and broken down barriers. Their achievements demonstrate that they are equally capable as men in both indoor and outdoor pursuits. Therefore, it is essential that universities recognize and acknowledge these accomplishments by providing equal opportunities for women to pursue higher education.The current job market also plays a significant role in shaping university admissions. Employers increasingly demand a diverse workforce, and universities must respond by designing courses that meet the needs of employers. By accepting equal numbers of male and female students, universities can ensure that they are providing a diverse talent pool that meets the demands of the job market. Moreover, a diverse student body enriches the learning environment, fostering creativity, innovation, and collaboration.Furthermore, every university designs its courses according to the needs of employers, and accepting equal numbers of male and female students helps universities achieve this goal. By providing equal opportunities for both genders, universities can produce graduates who are equipped with the skills and knowledge required by employers. This, in turn, enhances the employability of graduates and contributes to the development of a diverse and skilled workforce.In conclusion, accepting equal numbers of male and female students is crucial for promoting diversity, challenging gender stereotypes, and meeting the needs of employers. Women have proven themselves in various fields, and universities must recognize and acknowledge their achievements by providing equal opportunities. By doing so, universities can contribute to the development of a diverse and skilled workforce, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;The Quest for Independence: A Double-Edged SwordFor many young adults, leaving the family nest is a rite of passage, a declaration of independence and a desire to break free from the perceived constraints of parental supervision. The allure of unlimited freedom, autonomy, and self-reliance is a powerful draw, driving many to seek their own abode as soon as possible. However, in their haste to escape the watchful eyes of their parents, these young adults often overlook the harsh realities of independent living.While the prospect of living life on one's own terms may seem exhilarating, the reality can be overwhelming. The financial burdens of maintaining a household, managing daily expenses, and navigating the complexities of adulthood can quickly dampen the excitement of independence. Moreover, the added stress of cohabiting with roommates, with whom they may not always see eye-to-eye, can further complicate their lives.In contrast, living with parents can provide a sense of security and stability, allowing young adults to focus on their personal and professional development without the weight of financial worries. By living at home, they can conserve their resources, avoid the pressures of rent, utilities, and other expenses, and concentrate on building a solid foundation for their future.Furthermore, living with parents also provides an opportunity for young adults to develop essential life skills, such as cooking, cleaning, and time management, under the guidance of experienced mentors. This can help them transition more smoothly into independent living, should they choose to do so in the future.In conclusion, while the desire for independence is understandable, it is crucial for young adults to consider the potential challenges and consequences of living away from home. By weighing the pros and cons, they can make informed decisions that balance their need for autonomy with the benefits of living with parents. Ultimately, this thoughtful approach can lead to a more successful and stress-free transition into adulthood.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;"Air pollution is a significant threat to the environment, causing widespread harm in various ways. One of the most alarming effects is the depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore, air pollution is a major contributor to global warming, releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to devastating consequences.In my opinion, it is essential to place more responsibility on private individuals and companies to address this issue. One effective approach would be to implement a ""polluter pays"" principle, where those responsible for air pollution are required to pay for the clean-up efforts. This could be achieved through taxes or fees on polluting activities, such as industrial emissions or vehicle exhausts. By making individuals and companies accountable for their actions, we can encourage them to adopt cleaner practices and invest in sustainable technologies.However, governments also have a crucial role to play in mitigating air pollution. One key strategy is to restrict the use of products that cause air pollution. For example, governments could ban or limit the sale of products with high emissions, such as diesel generators or gas-powered lawn mowers. Additionally, they could establish emission standards for industries and vehicles, ensuring that companies and individuals adhere to cleaner practices.Furthermore, governments can also promote sustainable alternatives, such as electric or hybrid vehicles, and incentivize the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. By taking a multi-faceted approach, combining individual and corporate responsibility with government regulation, we can effectively combat air pollution and mitigate its harmful effects on the environment."
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;The role of advertising in influencing consumer purchasing decisions has been a topic of debate among marketers and scholars alike. While some argue that advertising is the most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product, others contend that it is not sufficient in itself to drive sales. In this essay, I will argue that advertising is indeed a crucial factor in convincing consumers to buy a product, but it is not a standalone solution. Rather, the product itself must also satisfy the needs of the consumers.On the one hand, advertising is a powerful tool that can shape consumer attitudes and behaviors. Well-crafted advertisements can create brand awareness, build desire, and ultimately drive sales. Effective advertising can differentiate a product from its competitors, highlighting its unique features and benefits. Moreover, advertising can reach a large audience, making it an efficient way to communicate with potential customers.On the other hand, advertising alone is not enough to guarantee the success of a product. If the product itself does not meet the needs and expectations of consumers, advertising will ultimately prove futile. Consumers will not be convinced to purchase a product that does not provide value, regardless of how appealing the advertisement may be. In fact, research has shown that word-of-mouth and personal experiences play a more significant role in shaping consumer purchasing decisions than advertising.In conclusion, advertising is a reflection of the power of persuasion, but it is only one piece of the puzzle. The product itself must also deliver on its promises and satisfy the needs of the consumers. Companies must strike a balance between investing in advertising and investing in product development, ensuring that the product meets the needs and expectations of the target market. By combining effective advertising with a quality product, businesses can create a winning formula that drives sales and builds customer loyalty.
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";"The question of whether universities are still relevant in today's society has sparked a heated debate. On one hand, there are those who advocate the impracticability of university, citing various reasons to support their claim. On the other hand, there are voices in opposition who firmly believe that universities continue to play a vital role in shaping the minds of future generations.Proponents of the ""university is impractical"" argument point to the rising costs of tuition fees, which they claim have made higher education inaccessible to many. They also argue that the traditional classroom setting is no longer effective, with many students opting for online courses and self-directed learning. Furthermore, they contend that the skills and knowledge gained in university are not directly applicable to the workforce, making the investment in a degree seem futile.On the other hand, those who oppose this view argue that universities provide not only skills for careers but also academic knowledge that is essential for personal growth and development. They assert that universities offer a unique environment where students can engage in critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, skills that are highly valued by employers. Moreover, universities provide a platform for students to explore their passions, develop their interests, and make valuable connections that can benefit them in the long run.In analyzing both views, it becomes clear that each has its merits and drawbacks. While it is true that the cost of university education can be prohibitively expensive, it is also true that the skills and knowledge gained in university are invaluable. Ultimately, the decision to attend university depends on individual circumstances and priorities. However, it is undeniable that universities continue to play a significant role in shaping the minds of future generations and providing them with the tools they need to succeed in their chosen careers."
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with each other. On one hand, it has brought about unprecedented convenience, enabling us to stay connected with others across geographical boundaries. However, this convenience has come at a cost, giving rise to a multitude of problems that affect our daily lives, social etiquette, and academic integrity. In this essay, I will analyze three issues that highlight the negative consequences of mobile phone usage, supporting the viewpoint that while mobile phones offer convenience, they also create significant problems.Firstly, the use of mobile phones in public areas has become a pressing concern. Speaking loudly on the phone in schools, libraries, and hospitals is not only impolite but also offensive. These areas are meant to be quiet and respectful, yet the constant ringing, buzzing, and loud conversations have disrupted the peaceful atmosphere. Furthermore, this behavior is a breach of basic social etiquette, causing disturbance to others who are trying to study, work, or recover.Secondly, mobile phones have become an effective tool for cheating in examinations. Students are using their cell phones to access unauthorized information, compromising the integrity of the assessment process. This not only undermines the value of education but also creates an unfair advantage for those who engage in such malpractices. As a result, the true potential of students is not accurately reflected in their grades, leading to an unfair evaluation of their abilities.Lastly, the over-reliance on mobile phones has also led to a decline in face-to-face interaction skills, social anxiety, and decreased attention span. The constant need to be connected has made us dependent on our devices, leading to a decline in meaningful relationships and deep thinking.In conclusion, while mobile phones offer convenience, they also create significant problems that affect our daily lives, social etiquette, and academic integrity.
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;The use of computers by children has been a topic of debate in recent years. While some people believe that computers are beneficial for children and should be used daily, others hold a different opinion. In my view, excessive use of computers by children can have negative consequences on their physical and social development.On the one hand, computers are an excellent tool for learning and can provide children with a vast amount of information and educational resources. They can also enhance children's cognitive skills, such as problem-solving and critical thinking. However, constant use of computers can have a negative impact on children's physical health, particularly their eyes. Staring at a screen for long periods of time can cause eye strain, headaches, and even lead to myopia (nearsightedness) in severe cases. This is a concern that cannot be ignored, as good eyesight is essential for a child's overall health and well-being.On the other hand, excessive use of computers can also lead to a decline in children's communication skills. Spending too much time playing games on the computer can isolate children from the outside world, reducing their opportunities to interact with others, share ideas, and develop essential social skills. This can lead to difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships, as well as problems with verbal and non-verbal communication. In today's society, where teamwork and communication are crucial for success, this is a skill that children cannot afford to miss.In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool for children's learning and development, excessive use can have negative consequences. Parents and educators should be aware of these risks and ensure that children use computers in moderation, balancing screen time with physical activity, social interaction, and other essential aspects of childhood development.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;As the world continues to industrialize and urbanize, the construction of factories has become an inevitable aspect of economic development. While there are valid concerns about the environmental impact of factories, it is imperative to acknowledge that the benefits of building a factory far outweigh its drawbacks, provided that we take proactive steps to mitigate its environmental consequences.On the one hand, a large factory can be a catalyst for local economic growth, creating jobs and stimulating economic activity in the surrounding area. By providing employment opportunities, factories can significantly reduce the unemployment rate, improving the overall quality of life for residents. Moreover, the influx of workers and their families can lead to an increase in demand for goods and services, thus boosting the local economy. For instance, a factory can create a ripple effect, leading to the establishment of ancillary businesses, such as restaurants, shops, and service providers, further contributing to the local economy.However, it is undeniable that factories can have detrimental effects on the environment, including air and water pollution, noise pollution, and the destruction of natural habitats. Nevertheless, with the implementation of stringent environmental regulations and the adoption of sustainable practices, these negative impacts can be significantly minimized. By investing in clean technologies, such as renewable energy sources and waste management systems, factories can reduce their ecological footprint.In conclusion, while the construction of factories is inevitable in today's industrialized society, it is crucial to address the environmental concerns associated with them. By doing so, we can harness the benefits of factory construction, including economic growth and job creation, while safeguarding the well-being of our planet. Ultimately, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, provided that we prioritize environmental sustainability and responsible industrial practices.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;The convenience of prepared food has become a staple in modern society, with many individuals relying on pre-packaged meals and snacks to fuel their busy lives. However, this trend has brought about some negative consequences that cannot be ignored. The over-reliance on prepared food has led to an increased use of artificial ingredients, which can have detrimental effects on our health. Many prepared foods contain preservatives, additives, and flavor enhancers that can cause a range of health problems, from allergies and intolerances to long-term diseases such as cancer and heart disease.Furthermore, the proliferation of prepared food has also led to a disregard for the nutritional value of food. Many prepared meals are high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats, and low in essential vitamins and minerals. This can lead to a diet that is unbalanced and lacking in the nutrients that our bodies need to function properly. Additionally, the modification of people's eating habits is another negative consequence of the prepared food culture. The ease and convenience of prepared food can lead to a reliance on unhealthy eating habits, such as overeating and making poor food choices.Another significant consequence of the prepared food trend is the loss of cooking skills. The more prepared food we eat, the less we need to cook, and as a result, many people are losing the skills and knowledge that are necessary to prepare healthy, balanced meals. This is a shame, as cooking is an essential life skill that not only provides us with the ability to nourish our bodies, but also brings people together and provides a sense of community and connection. As we continue to rely on prepared food, we are not only harming our health, but also losing a valuable part of our cultural heritage.In conclusion, while prepared food may be convenient, it is essential that we are aware of the negative consequences of this trend. By making informed choices about the food we eat, and taking the time to cook and prepare healthy meals, we can protect our health, preserve our cultural heritage, and ensure that future generations have the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;The gap between the rich and the poor has been a longstanding issue in the global community. In recent years, some developed countries and organizations have taken steps to bridge this gap by providing financial assistance to impoverished nations. This essay will examine the necessity of developing education in these countries and the real objectives of the supporters, highlighting the idea that there is no free lunch in the world.On one hand, education is a vital component in the development of any nation. Impoverished countries often struggle to provide quality education to their citizens, leading to a lack of skilled workers and a stagnant economy. By providing financial assistance, developed countries and organizations aim to improve the educational infrastructure in these nations, enabling them to produce a more skilled workforce. This, in turn, can lead to economic growth and a reduction in poverty.On the other hand, the real objectives of the supporters cannot be ignored. It is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world, meaning that every action has a consequence or a hidden agenda. In this case, the financial assistance provided by developed countries and organizations may come with strings attached. For instance, the recipient country may be required to adopt certain economic policies or trade agreements that benefit the donor country. Alternatively, the assistance may be used as a tool for political leverage, allowing the donor country to exert influence over the recipient nation's foreign policy.In conclusion, while the provision of financial assistance to impoverished countries is a noble endeavor, it is essential to recognize the underlying motivations and consequences. The development of education in these nations is crucial for their growth, but it is equally important to acknowledge that there is no free lunch in the world. The supporters' objectives must be carefully examined to ensure that the assistance provided is not a means to an end, but rather a genuine attempt to uplift the recipient nation.
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;The world of advertising is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it plays a crucial role in promoting goods and services, allowing companies to reach their target audience and increase sales. Many businesses, as well as governments, rely heavily on advertising to sustain their operations. However, there is a growing concern about the impact of certain types of advertisements on our children.Advertisements for alcohol, cigarettes, and goods and services with adult content are particularly problematic. These ads can have a profound negative effect on young minds, exposing them to harmful substances and inappropriate content. Children are impressionable and often lack the critical thinking skills to distinguish between what is good and bad for them. By exposing them to these types of ads, we risk shaping their attitudes and behaviors in ways that can be detrimental to their health and well-being.Moreover, research has shown that exposure to alcohol and cigarette ads can lead to increased consumption among minors. Similarly, ads with adult content can lead to premature exposure to mature themes, potentially harming their emotional and psychological development. As a society, it is our responsibility to protect our children from these harmful influences.Therefore, I firmly believe that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, and goods and services with adult content should be prohibited. This is not to say that companies and governments should not advertise at all. Rather, we need to find ways to promote products and services in a responsible and child-friendly manner. By doing so, we can ensure that advertising serves its purpose without compromising the well-being of our most vulnerable citizens – our children. Ultimately, it is our collective responsibility to create a safe and healthy environment for our children to grow and thrive.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;The Changing Role of Married Women in the Workforce: A Path to Empowerment and EqualityIn recent years, significant strides have been made in eradicating employment discrimination based on gender, paving the way for married women to pursue careers alongside men. This shift has not only transformed the lives of married women but also had a profound impact on their families and society as a whole.One of the most notable benefits of married women taking up jobs is the financial stability it brings to their families. By earning a separate income, wives can contribute significantly to the household earnings, improving the overall quality of life for their loved ones. This, in turn, enables families to enjoy greater financial security, invest in their children's education, and plan for a more stable future.Beyond the financial advantages, working outside the home has a profound impact on married women's personal growth and development. Interacting with the outside world broadens their perspectives, fosters independence, and helps build confidence. As they navigate the challenges of their careers, they strengthen their characters and demonstrate their capabilities, dispelling outdated stereotypes about the roles of women. This newfound self-assurance is then reflected in their family life, as they become more effective partners and parents.The influence of working married women extends to their children, who grow up witnessing their mothers as empowered, capable, and equal individuals. This exposure shapes their own views on gender roles and encourages them to adopt more progressive values. As a result, future generations are more likely to embrace equality and mutual respect in their relationships, perpetuating a more equitable society.In conclusion, the increasing participation of married women in the workforce has been a transformative force, not only for themselves but also for their families and communities. By pursuing careers, married women are not only securing financial stability but also redefining their roles, building stronger characters, and inspiring future generations. This shift is a significant step towards a more balanced and equitable society, where men and women can thrive together.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";The provision of education is a fundamental responsibility of any government, and it is widely accepted that primary and secondary education should be freely provided to all citizens. This is because these stages of education are essential for the development of basic skills and knowledge that are necessary for individuals to contribute to society. Governments around the world have recognized this and have implemented policies to ensure that every child has access to free primary and secondary education.However, when it comes to higher education, such as university, the situation is different. University education is specialized and costly, and it is not feasible for governments to provide it for free to all citizens. Moreover, university education is often pursued by individuals who are already adults and are expected to take responsibility for their own decisions and expenses. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect students or their parents to pay for university fees.However, this approach raises concerns about equity and fairness. Many parents may not have enough money to pay for their children's university fees, which could limit their access to higher education and create unequal opportunities. This is a valid concern, as higher education is often a key factor in determining an individual's socio-economic status and future prospects.On the other hand, it is also important to consider the government's perspective. Governments already spend a significant amount of money on providing free primary and secondary education, and it may not be sustainable for them to also provide free university education. The government's resources are limited, and they have to prioritize their spending based on the needs of the society as a whole.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, it is reasonable to expect students or their parents to pay for university fees. However, governments should also consider implementing measures to support students from low-income families, such as scholarships, grants, or loan schemes, to ensure that everyone has access to higher education regardless of their financial background. This approach would strike a balance between individual responsibility and government support, and would ensure that higher education is accessible to all citizens.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;The debate over the most convenient and environmentally friendly means of transportation has been a longstanding one. While some argue that the automobile is the most convenient mode of transportation, others counter that alternative forms of transport should be considered in light of the devastating environmental pollution caused by the automobile industry. In this essay, we will delve into the arguments on both sides and explore the reasons why alternative forms of transportation are gaining traction.On the one hand, the automobile is undoubtedly a convenient mode of transportation. It provides individuals with the freedom to travel wherever and whenever they please, without being bound by the constraints of public transportation schedules. Additionally, automobiles offer a level of comfort and privacy that is unparalleled by other modes of transportation. However, the convenience of automobiles comes at a steep environmental cost. The production and disposal of automobiles result in significant greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution.On the other hand, alternative forms of transportation, such as cycling, walking, and public transportation, offer a more environmentally friendly option. These modes of transportation not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also promote physical activity and a sense of community. Furthermore, public transportation systems can be designed to be efficient and reliable, making them a viable alternative to automobile travel. For instance, cities with well-developed public transportation systems, such as Tokyo and New York, have significantly lower per-capita emissions than cities that rely heavily on automobile travel.In conclusion, while the automobile may be a convenient mode of transportation, its environmental costs cannot be ignored. As our awareness of the environmental impact of our actions grows, it is imperative that we consider alternative forms of transportation that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly. By promoting the use of public transportation, cycling, and walking, we can reduce our reliance on automobiles and create a more sustainable future for generations to come.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";The notion of providing aid to impoverished countries has been a topic of debate among economists and policymakers for years. While some argue that such efforts are futile and may even have negative side-effects, I firmly believe that the benefits of aiding poor countries far outweigh the drawbacks.First and foremost, many poor countries lack the basic materials and facilities necessary to kick-start businesses and stimulate economic growth. In the absence of adequate infrastructure, it is extremely challenging for entrepreneurs to establish and sustain successful ventures. By providing aid, wealthier nations can help bridge this gap, enabling poor countries to build the foundations necessary for economic development. This, in turn, can create a ripple effect, leading to increased employment opportunities, improved living standards, and a reduction in poverty.Another significant advantage of aiding poor countries is that it raises awareness about the plight of impoverished communities. By launching aid campaigns, organizations and governments can bring attention to the struggles faced by millions of people worldwide, prompting individuals to consider the needs of those less fortunate. This heightened sense of empathy and social responsibility can lead to increased support for initiatives aimed at alleviating poverty, ultimately contributing to a more equitable global society.Furthermore, aid campaigns often include practical benefits that can have a direct and tangible impact on the lives of those in need. For instance, aid programs may provide essential services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation, which are critical for human development and well-being. Additionally, aid can be used to support small-scale farmers, artisans, and other local businesses, enabling them to access markets and improve their economic prospects.In conclusion, while there may be some drawbacks to providing aid to poor countries, the benefits far outweigh the negative side-effects. By addressing the shortage of basic materials and facilities, raising awareness about poverty, and providing practical benefits, aid campaigns can play a vital role in promoting economic development, improving living standards, and reducing poverty worldwide.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";Globalization is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has sparked intense debates about its impact on societies around the world. While some people perceive globalization as a threat to the ethnic and religious values of their country, others believe that it contributes effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects.On one hand, the critics of globalization argue that it leads to the homogenization of cultures, threatening the unique traditions and values of local communities. They contend that the dominance of Western culture and values imposed through globalization undermines the diversity of ethnic and religious identities, leading to a loss of cultural heritage. Moreover, they claim that globalization promotes a consumerist culture that erodes traditional values and ways of life, replacing them with a materialistic and individualistic worldview.On the other hand, proponents of globalization argue that it has the potential to bring about significant improvements to the world in many aspects. They point out that globalization has facilitated the exchange of ideas, cultures, and values across borders, promoting cross-cultural understanding and tolerance. Globalization has also enabled the sharing of knowledge, technology, and expertise, leading to advancements in fields such as healthcare, education, and environmental protection. Furthermore, globalization has created new economic opportunities, lifted millions of people out of poverty, and promoted global cooperation on issues such as climate change and pandemics.In conclusion, the impact of globalization on ethnic and religious values is a contentious issue. While some people see it as a threat to local cultures and traditions, others believe that it contributes to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Ultimately, the key to harnessing the benefits of globalization while preserving local values and traditions lies in striking a balance between globalization and localization.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The debate surrounding the age at which children should be allowed to leave school has sparked intense discussion among educators, policymakers, and the general public. While some argue that children should be permitted to leave school early to pursue employment, others firmly believe that they should be required to complete their education. In this essay, we will examine both perspectives and provide evidence to support the view that children should be compelled to study at school.On one hand, proponents of early school leaving argue that it allows children to enter the workforce at a younger age, thereby gaining valuable work experience and contributing to their family's income. They claim that this approach helps to equip children with practical skills that are essential for their future careers. Moreover, they argue that not all children are academically inclined, and that forcing them to stay in school can lead to disengagement and poor academic performance.On the other hand, those who advocate for compulsory education argue that it provides children with a solid foundation for their future success. Education is essential for personal growth, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. By staying in school, children can acquire knowledge in various subjects, develop their communication skills, and build their confidence. Furthermore, education opens doors to better job opportunities, higher salaries, and a more stable financial future.Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that students should be forced to study at schools. While it is true that not all children are academically inclined, it is equally true that education is a fundamental right that every child deserves. By requiring children to complete their education, we can ensure that they are equipped with the skills, knowledge, and values necessary to succeed in life. Moreover, education is essential for personal growth, and it is the key to unlocking a child's full potential.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that children should be compelled to study at school. Education is a fundamental right that every child deserves, and it is essential for their personal growth, future success, and contribution to society. By requiring children to complete their education, we can ensure that they are equipped with the skills, knowledge, and values necessary to succeed in life.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;The impact of advertisements on consumer behavior has been a subject of debate among scholars and experts. On one hand, some people argue that advertisements have a manipulative effect, convincing people to buy products that are unnecessary and only appear appealing on television. This perspective suggests that advertisements often prioritize aesthetics over authenticity, creating a distorted view of the product's actual value. As a result, consumers may find themselves purchasing items they don't need, solely based on the attractive presentation.However, despite the potential drawbacks of advertisements, they undoubtedly play a vital role in the economy. One of their primary functions is introducing new products to the market, allowing consumers to become aware of innovative goods and services. This not only expands the range of choices available to consumers but also fosters competition among businesses, driving them to improve their offerings. Furthermore, advertisements often provide entertainment value, with many being visually engaging and enjoyable to watch. This aspect of advertising can be seen in the production quality of many commercials, which can rival that of film and television productions.In conclusion, while advertisements can be misleading and exaggerated, they are an integral part of a functioning economy. By introducing new products and providing consumers with various options, advertisements stimulate economic growth and development. Additionally, they often serve as a source of entertainment, making them a ubiquitous and multifaceted aspect of modern life.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;The debate on gun control has been a contentious issue in many societies, with proponents arguing that it infringes upon individual rights and opponents advocating for stricter regulations to ensure public safety. From my perspective, it is sensible to enforce gun control, as the potential risks associated with unregulated gun ownership far outweigh any perceived benefits.Firstly, guns are not a normal good in our society, unlike other consumer products, they are designed to cause harm and have no alternative uses. As such, it is logical that they should be strictly controlled to prevent misuse. Most countries recognize this and have implemented laws to regulate the sale, possession, and use of firearms. These laws are in place to protect citizens from the inherent dangers of guns, and it is essential that we support and strengthen these regulations.The consequences of lax gun control are stark. The rise in accident rates, violent crime rates, and suicide rates are all directly linked to the availability of guns. In the United States, for example, the lack of stringent gun control has led to numerous mass shootings and a significant increase in gun-related deaths. It is our collective responsibility to prevent such tragedies and ensure that guns are not easily accessible to those who would misuse them.Limiting the availability of guns is a crucial step in reducing the incidence of accidents, violent crime, and suicide. By enforcing stricter regulations, we can prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands and reduce the number of senseless deaths. This is not about taking away individual rights, but about prioritizing public safety and the well-being of our communities. In conclusion, I firmly believe that stricter gun control is essential, and it is our duty to support and advocate for such measures to create a safer society for all.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;The realm of international sporting events has long been regarded as a platform for nations to come together, fostering camaraderie and healthy competition. One of the significant benefits of such events is their role in easing international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions.Historically, international sporting events have served as a catalyst for bridging gaps between nations, often amidst strained diplomatic relationships. For instance, the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, witnessed a historic moment of unity when North and South Korean athletes marched together under the same flag, signifying a temporary truce in their long-standing conflict. Similarly, the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics have consistently brought nations together, transcending political differences and promoting a sense of global citizenship.Moreover, international sporting events offer a unique opportunity for fans to express their patriotic sentiments in a safe and controlled environment. As noted by Yang, these events enable fans to release their emotions in a way that is both passionate and peaceful. The electric atmosphere of a packed stadium, with fans clad in their national colors, is a testament to the power of sports in evoking strong emotions. However, this expression of patriotism is contained within the realm of sports, preventing it from spilling over into harmful or aggressive behavior.In conclusion, international sporting events play a vital role in easing international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions. By fostering a sense of global community and promoting peaceful expression of national pride, these events contribute significantly to a more harmonious and interconnected world. As the world continues to grapple with geopolitical challenges, the importance of international sporting events in promoting unity and understanding cannot be overstated.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;The notion that the rapid advancement of technology has a negative impact on the widening gap between the rich and the poor has been a topic of debate in recent years. While some people argue that technology exacerbates the disparities between the affluent and the impoverished, I respectfully disagree with this opinion. In my view, technological progress has actually helped to bridge the gap, and I would like to present two key reasons to support my stance.Firstly, the relentless march of material technology has led to a significant decrease in the prices of a vast array of products. With the advent of mass production and automation, the cost of manufacturing has plummeted, making goods more accessible and affordable for people from all walks of life. This phenomenon has democratized access to essential goods and services, enabling low-income households to acquire products that were previously unaffordable. For instance, the proliferation of smartphones has enabled people in developing countries to access information, education, and financial services, thereby bridging the gap with their wealthier counterparts.Secondly, technical developments have boosted productivity, liberating people from mundane and time-consuming tasks. Automation has taken over routine chores, freeing up time and energy for more meaningful pursuits. This has enabled individuals to invest their time in personal development, education, and entrepreneurship, ultimately enhancing their socio-economic prospects. Furthermore, technological advancements have also created new job opportunities in fields such as software development, data analysis, and digital marketing, which have become essential skills in today's economy.In conclusion, while it is true that the benefits of technological progress may not be evenly distributed, I firmly believe that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. By making products more affordable and increasing productivity, technology has played a significant role in bridging the gap between the rich and the poor. As technology continues to evolve, it is imperative that we harness its potential to create a more equitable society, where everyone has access to the tools and resources needed to thrive.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;"The debate about the importance of space exploration has been ongoing for decades, with some people viewing it as a frivolous endeavor that wastes valuable resources. However, this perspective overlooks the numerous benefits and discoveries that have been made possible through space travel.One of the most significant breakthroughs in human understanding of our planet came from the famous ""Blue Marble"" photograph taken by the Apollo 17 crew in 1972. This image of the Earth from space provided irrefutable proof that our planet is, in fact, round, rather than flat, a notion that had been disputed for centuries. The photograph not only put an end to the flat Earth theory but also marked a turning point in our understanding of our planet's shape and size.Furthermore, observing the Earth from outer space has enabled scientists to gather valuable data about our planet's atmosphere. By studying the Earth from space, researchers have been able to gain insights into the composition of the atmosphere, the effects of pollution, and the impact of climate change. This information has been crucial in informing policies and strategies aimed at protecting our planet and mitigating the effects of human activity on the environment.Moreover, space exploration has led to numerous technological innovations that have improved daily life on Earth. From GPS technology to memory foam, many of the conveniences we enjoy today have their roots in space research. Space travel has also pushed the boundaries of human knowledge, inspiring new generations of scientists, engineers, and innovators.In conclusion, while some may view space exploration as a waste of resources, the benefits and discoveries that have been made possible through space travel far outweigh the costs. By continuing to explore and study our planet from space, we can gain a deeper understanding of our world and its place in the universe, ultimately leading to a more sustainable and enlightened future for all."
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;The modern university experience has evolved significantly, with students being exposed to extra jobs from the outset of their academic journey. While some may argue that this trend has its drawbacks, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the negatives. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of students engaging in extra jobs during their university years, highlighting the invaluable practical experience they gain.One of the primary advantages of students taking on extra jobs is the acquisition of practical skills that complement their academic learning. By working part-time, students can apply theoretical concepts to real-world situations, developing a deeper understanding of their chosen field. For instance, a business student working in a retail environment can gain hands-on experience in customer service, marketing, and finance, making their academic studies more relatable and engaging. This fusion of theoretical knowledge and practical application enhances their overall learning experience, preparing them for the workforce.Moreover, extra jobs provide students with an opportunity to develop essential soft skills, such as time management, communication, and teamwork. Balancing academic responsibilities with work commitments teaches students to prioritize tasks, manage their time effectively, and maintain a healthy work-life balance. These skills are highly valued by employers, making students more employable and competitive in the job market. Furthermore, working in a team environment fosters collaboration, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, all of which are crucial in today's fast-paced, dynamic work environments.Another significant advantage of students engaging in extra jobs is the financial benefits. Part-time employment helps students cover living expenses, tuition fees, and other academic-related costs, reducing their reliance on student loans and financial aid. This, in turn, minimizes their debt burden, allowing them to focus on their studies and extracurricular activities without undue financial stress.While some may argue that extra jobs can negatively impact academic performance, I believe that this is largely dependent on individual time management and prioritization. With careful planning and commitment, students can excel in both their academic and professional pursuits.In conclusion, the advantages of students engaging in extra jobs during their university years far outweigh the disadvantages. By gaining practical experience, developing essential soft skills, and enjoying financial benefits, students can enhance their academic learning, become more employable, and set themselves up for success in their chosen careers.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;The practice of sending students to work for companies without salaries, commonly known as unpaid internships, has been a topic of debate among educators, employers, and students alike. While some may view this practice as exploitative, others see it as a valuable learning opportunity for students. In this essay, we will explore the benefits that both students and organizations can derive from this activity.For students, participating in unpaid internships can provide invaluable work experience and skills that are not easily gained in a classroom setting. By working in a real-world environment, students can apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, developing problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and teamwork abilities. Moreover, internships offer students the chance to network with professionals in their field, potentially leading to future job opportunities or mentorship. Unpaid internships can also help students build their portfolios, enhancing their chances of securing employment after graduation.As for the organizations, the benefits of hosting unpaid interns are multifaceted. One of the most obvious advantages is the cost savings, as interns are not paid a salary. However, this benefit should not be overstated, as hosting interns still requires significant investment in terms of time and resources. More importantly, interns can bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to the workplace, enriching the organization's culture and potentially leading to new solutions. Furthermore, interns can assist with workload, freeing up staff to focus on more complex tasks. Organizations also benefit from the opportunity to assess potential future employees, potentially identifying talented individuals to recruit after graduation.In conclusion, while the debate surrounding unpaid internships continues, it is clear that both students and organizations can benefit from this activity. By providing students with valuable work experience and skills, and organizations with cost savings, fresh perspectives, and potential future employees, unpaid internships can be a mutually beneficial arrangement.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;The age-old question of how to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive has been debated by managers and scholars alike. One commonly held assumption is that the only way to boost employee motivation is by raising their salaries. While a raise or a promotion can undoubtedly increase morale in the workplace, it is not the only way to motivate employees. In fact, research has shown that money is not the sole driver of motivation, and that other factors play a crucial role in stimulating employee productivity.On one hand, it is undeniable that a salary increase can have a positive impact on employee motivation. A higher salary can provide a sense of financial security, allowing employees to focus on their work without the burden of financial stress. Moreover, a raise can be seen as a tangible recognition of an employee's hard work and dedication, boosting their self-esteem and motivation. However, relying solely on salary increases to motivate employees can have its drawbacks. For instance, it can create an expectation of regular raises, leading to dissatisfaction and decreased motivation if these expectations are not met.On the other hand, there are numerous non-monetary factors that can motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive. For example, a sense of purpose and meaning in their work, opportunities for growth and development, and a positive work-life balance can all contribute to employee motivation. Additionally, recognition and praise from managers and colleagues, as well as a sense of autonomy and ownership over their work, can also play a significant role in stimulating employee productivity.In conclusion, while a raise or a promotion can certainly increase morale and motivation in the workplace, it is not the only way to motivate employees. Managers and organizations should consider a range of factors, including non-monetary incentives, to create a motivating work environment. By recognizing the complexity of human motivation, employers can create a more engaged, productive, and successful workforce.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;Large-scale sports games have the power to captivate the world's attention, shifting focus away from international disputes and onto the thrill of competition. This phenomenon is particularly evident during global events like the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, where nations come together to showcase their athletic prowess. As millions of people gather to watch their national teams compete, a sense of pride and patriotism swells, momentarily eclipsing the tensions and conflicts that often plague international relations.The ability of sports to transcend borders and foster a sense of unity is a significant factor in promoting peace. By bringing people together in a shared experience, sports events create a platform for nations to engage in a common language, one that speaks to the universal values of fair play, teamwork, and perseverance. This shared language has the power to bridge cultural and ideological divides, allowing people to connect on a human level, beyond the confines of politics and diplomacy.Furthermore, large-scale sports games encourage people to display their national symbols, such as flags, anthems, and colors, in a spirit of friendly competition. This display of national pride is not only a celebration of one's own heritage but also a gesture of respect towards other nations and their traditions. As people come together to cheer on their teams, they are reminded of the common humanity that binds them, and the petty squabbles that often drive nations apart are momentarily forgotten.In conclusion, large-scale sports games offer a unique opportunity for nations to come together in a spirit of peace and unity. By shifting focus away from international disputes and onto the thrill of competition, these events encourage people to display their national pride and connect with others on a shared level. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of global conflict, the power of sports to bring people together should not be underestimated.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;Despite the abundance of water on Earth, it has become a scarce resource in many parts of the world due to overuse and mismanagement. Paradoxically, water remains the major source of energy today, with many countries relying heavily on hydroelectric power to generate electricity. However, the irony lies in the fact that water scarcity poses a significant challenge to the production of hydroelectric power. Despite this, many countries continue to depend solely on this source of energy.Moreover, the majority of sources currently used to generate power, such as fossil fuels, release massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This contributes significantly to global warming, a pressing issue that requires immediate attention. The over-reliance on these polluting sources of energy is not only unsustainable but also detrimental to the environment.On the other hand, there is a pressing need to adopt sustainable energy sources that do not compromise the environment. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and geothermal, offer promising alternatives to traditional energy sources. These sources of energy are not only environmentally friendly but also abundant and sustainable. However, despite the benefits of renewable energy, the transition to these sources has been slow due to various challenges, including high upfront costs and lack of infrastructure.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;The issue of unemployment is a pervasive global problem that affects both developed and developing nations. It is a multifaceted issue with far-reaching consequences, including economic instability, social unrest, and personal hardship. While some argue that the responsibility of addressing unemployment lies with the government, I firmly believe that it is the responsibility of the disadvantaged citizens themselves to take proactive steps to improve their circumstances.Firstly, individuals must take ownership of their own employability. In today's fast-paced and ever-changing job market, it is essential that individuals continually update their skills and knowledge to remain competitive. This can be achieved through self-directed learning, online courses, and vocational training. By investing in their own human capital, individuals can enhance their employability and increase their chances of securing a job.Secondly, entrepreneurship is a viable solution to unemployment. With the rise of the gig economy and digital platforms, it is easier than ever for individuals to turn their passions into income-generating ventures. By taking the initiative to start their own businesses, individuals can create their own employment opportunities and contribute to the overall economic growth of their communities.Thirdly, community-based initiatives can also play a crucial role in addressing unemployment. Disadvantaged citizens can come together to establish community gardens, cooperatives, and other collective enterprises that provide employment opportunities and stimulate local economic development.In conclusion, while the government can provide support and resources, the responsibility of addressing unemployment ultimately lies with the disadvantaged citizens themselves. By taking proactive steps to enhance their employability, exploring entrepreneurial opportunities, and participating in community-based initiatives, individuals can empower themselves to break the cycle of unemployment and build a brighter future for themselves and their communities.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;A university, in its essence, serves as a conduit for the dissemination of knowledge, offering students a platform to access and absorb information across various disciplines. In this context, it is not imperative for a university to provide a comprehensive array of courses or training programs at all times. Rather, the focus should be on making these resources available as and when they are needed.The notion of offering a vast range of courses and training programs may seem appealing, but it is not always practical or necessary. Firstly, it would be impractical for a university to maintain a vast array of courses, many of which may have limited demand or enrollment. This would lead to inefficient resource allocation, with many courses operating at a significant financial loss. Furthermore, such an approach may dilute the quality of education, as faculty resources and expertise would be spread too thin.Instead, a university should focus on being responsive to the evolving needs of its students and the broader community. This can be achieved through a flexible and adaptive approach to course and program offerings. By continuously monitoring student demand, industry trends, and societal needs, a university can ensure that the courses and training programs it offers are relevant, timely, and of high quality.Moreover, with the advent of digital technologies and online learning platforms, universities can now offer courses and programs on-demand, without the need for a physical presence. This has opened up new avenues for universities to provide access to knowledge, without the burden of maintaining a vast array of courses.In conclusion, a university's primary role is to provide access to knowledge, not to offer an exhaustive array of courses or training programs. By adopting a responsive and adaptive approach, universities can ensure that their offerings are relevant, effective, and meet the evolving needs of their students and the broader community.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;The Role of Zoos in Protecting Wild Lives: A CritiqueThe notion that zoos serve as sanctuaries for wild animals, protecting them from harm and extinction, has been a long-held belief. However, a growing number of critics argue that zoos are more likely to be a killer than a protector of wild lives. This essay will examine the validity of this claim and explore the alternatives to zoos in safeguarding the well-being of wild animals.One of the primary concerns with zoos is the limited space and unnatural environments they provide for animals. In the wild, animals roam free and interact with their natural habitats, whereas in zoos, they are confined to small enclosures that cannot replicate the complexities of their natural habitats. This can lead to stress, behavioral problems, and even death. Moreover, zoos often prioritize entertainment value over animal welfare, with some institutions engaging in inhumane practices such as breeding programs that prioritize genetic diversity over animal health.In contrast, strict laws prohibiting poaching and habitat destruction can provide a safe haven for wild animals in their natural habitats. By protecting their natural environments and preventing human-wildlife conflict, we can ensure the long-term survival of various species. In fact, many conservation efforts have shown that protecting natural habitats and combating poaching can be highly effective in safeguarding wildlife populations.Furthermore, zoos often fail to contribute significantly to conservation efforts. While some zoos may engage in breeding programs or support conservation initiatives, the impact is often negligible compared to the scale of the problem. In addition, the resources spent on maintaining zoos could be better allocated towards in-situ conservation efforts, which have been shown to be more effective in protecting wild animals.In conclusion, while the intention behind zoos may be to protect wild lives, the reality is that they often fall short of this goal. Instead, strict laws and conservation efforts that prioritize the protection of natural habitats and prevent human-wildlife conflict are more effective in safeguarding the well-being of wild animals. By recognizing the limitations of zoos and redirecting our efforts towards in-situ conservation, we can make a more meaningful impact in protecting the world's precious wildlife.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;The rise of online teaching has revolutionized the way we learn, offering unprecedented flexibility and accessibility to students worldwide. As colleges and universities continue to evolve, it is imperative that online teaching becomes a widespread and integral part of their educational offerings.One of the most significant advantages of online teaching is the convenience it brings to students. With the ability to access course materials and attend virtual classes from anywhere in the world, students are no longer limited by geographical constraints. This is particularly beneficial for students who may have work or family commitments, or those who live in remote areas with limited access to educational institutions. Distance learning enables students to pursue higher education without having to relocate or compromise on their other responsibilities.Another significant benefit of online teaching is the ability to reach a larger audience. With the presence of video conferencing tools, teachers can now engage with a greater number of students simultaneously, transcending traditional classroom boundaries. This allows for more students to access high-quality education, regardless of their location or financial means. Moreover, online teaching enables teachers to use a variety of interactive tools and multimedia resources, making learning more engaging and effective.Furthermore, online teaching also offers a range of environmental and economic benefits. By reducing the need for commuting and physical infrastructure, online teaching can help reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability. Additionally, online teaching can also help reduce costs associated with traditional teaching methods, such as textbooks and transportation.In conclusion, the benefits of online teaching are numerous and far-reaching. As technology continues to advance and improve, it is imperative that colleges and universities prioritize the adoption of online teaching methods to provide students with greater flexibility, accessibility, and convenience. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and equitable education system that benefits students worldwide.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";The advent of modern communication technologies has revolutionized the way we interact with each other, transforming the fabric of our daily lives. Mobile phones, emails, and internet chat programs such as MSN Messenger have bridged geographical gaps, enabling seamless connectivity across the globe. While these innovations have undoubtedly brought about numerous benefits, there exists a lingering debate about the overall impact of these advancements.On one hand, proponents of modern communication technologies argue that they have opened up unprecedented opportunities for global communication, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. With just a few clicks, individuals can now access vast amounts of information, connect with people from diverse backgrounds, and conduct business transactions with ease. Furthermore, these technologies have enabled remote work, online education, and virtual social interactions, thereby enhancing flexibility, convenience, and social connections.On the other hand, opponents of modern communication technologies claim that the benefits of these innovations are not equally distributed. They argue that only the more privileged segments of society, who have access to these technologies, are able to reap the benefits, while the less fortunate are left behind. This digital divide is exacerbated by factors such as socioeconomic status, geographical location, and literacy levels. In developing countries, for instance, many people lack access to reliable internet connectivity, mobile phones, and computers, thereby missing out on the opportunities that these technologies provide.Moreover, the over-reliance on modern communication technologies has also raised concerns about the erosion of face-to-face communication skills, deepened social isolation, and decreased attention span. The constant bombardment of information and the pressure to maintain a digital presence can also lead to mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression.In conclusion, while modern communication technologies have undoubtedly transformed our lives, it is crucial to acknowledge the disparities in access to these technologies and the potential negative consequences of their overuse. To ensure that the benefits of these innovations are equitably distributed, it is essential to address the digital divide and promote responsible technology use.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;The debate on whether music should be taught as a main subject in high school has been a contentious issue for a while now. On one hand, many people firmly believe that music should be a compulsory subject in high school, while on the other hand, there are those who think it is an unnecessary subject and should be optional. As for me, I strongly believe that students should focus on developing their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects.First and foremost, high school students need to be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in their future careers. With the increasing competition in the job market, students must be prepared to face the challenges of the real world. Occupation-related subjects such as mathematics, science, and languages are essential in providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen careers. Music, while being an enriching and enjoyable subject, does not provide the same level of practicality and relevance to future careers.Moreover, with the limited time and resources available in high school, it is crucial that students prioritize their studies and focus on the subjects that will benefit them the most in the long run. By making music an optional subject, students can choose to pursue it if they have a genuine interest and talent in the subject, while those who do not can focus on more relevant subjects. This way, students can make the most of their time in high school and set themselves up for success in their future careers.In conclusion, while music is an important part of a well-rounded education, I firmly believe that students should prioritize developing their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects. By making music an optional subject, students can choose to pursue their passions while also preparing themselves for the challenges of the real world.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;The role of libraries and sports activities in universities' success cannot be overstated. Both play crucial roles in fostering a well-rounded academic environment. However, in my opinion, universities should prioritize investments in libraries over any other area. This perspective stems from two key reasons: the vital and strategic importance of libraries and their reliance on institutional funding.Firstly, a library is a vital and strategic part of a university. It serves as the heart of academic research and learning, providing students, faculty, and staff with access to a vast array of resources. Libraries offer an inclusive space for studying, learning, and innovation, equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and technology. They are essential for supporting the curriculum, facilitating research, and enhancing the overall academic experience. A well-equipped and well-maintained library is not just a resource center but a hub that fosters collaboration, creativity, and intellectual growth. By investing in libraries, universities can ensure that their academic programs are supported by a robust infrastructure that meets the evolving needs of the academic community.Secondly, libraries typically do not generate income in the same way that sports activities might, through ticket sales or sponsorships. Unlike sports facilities, which can sometimes be self-sustaining or even revenue-generating, libraries are generally dependent on the university's budget for their operations and development. This makes investment in libraries even more critical, as they require consistent financial support to maintain their collections, update their resources, and provide the necessary services to students and faculty. By prioritizing investments in libraries, universities can ensure that this essential component of academic life remains vibrant and effective.In conclusion, while both libraries and sports activities are crucial for a university's success, the strategic importance of libraries and their reliance on institutional funding make them a priority for investment. Universities that prioritize their libraries are likely to see a stronger academic performance, more research output, and a more satisfied student body.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";The Prevalence of English: Benefits and DrawbacksThe widespread use of English has sparked a heated debate among scholars and linguists. On one hand, some people argue that the prevalence of English brings numerous benefits for individuals and societies. On the other hand, opponents claim that the dominant status of English has led to the destruction of cultural diversity and the extinction of lesser-used languages.Proponents of English argue that it has become the lingua franca of international communication, facilitating global understanding and cooperation. English has opened up new opportunities for education, business, and cultural exchange, enabling people to access a vast array of information and resources. Moreover, English has become the language of science, technology, and innovation, allowing researchers and scientists to share their findings and collaborate across borders.However, opponents of English dominance argue that it has come at the expense of cultural diversity and linguistic richness. The spread of English has led to the decline of many lesser-used languages, as younger generations increasingly opt for English as their primary language. This has resulted in the loss of cultural heritage and traditional knowledge, as many languages are closely tied to the history, customs, and beliefs of their respective communities.Furthermore, critics argue that English is not a sufficient language to express the nuances of life, particularly in Asian countries with distinct linguistic systems. For instance, many Asian languages have complex grammatical structures and tonal systems that are difficult to replicate in English. This has led to a loss of subtlety and precision in communication, as important cultural and contextual information is lost in translation.In conclusion, while English has undoubtedly brought many benefits, its dominance has also had significant drawbacks. It is essential to strike a balance between promoting English as a global language and preserving cultural diversity and linguistic richness. By recognizing the value of lesser-used languages and promoting multilingualism, we can work towards a more inclusive and diverse linguistic landscape.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The debate surrounding the use of animals for human needs has been a longstanding one, with many individuals advocating for their exploitation, while others express concerns about their welfare. On one hand, numerous people promote the utilization of animals for various purposes, such as food, clothing, and entertainment. They argue that animals have been used by humans for centuries, and that it is a natural part of human life. On the other hand, many are troubled by the notion that animals are often misused and exploited beyond their limits.Farmers and owners, in particular, are often guilty of pushing animals to their limits, prioritizing productivity and profit over animal welfare. Factory farms, for instance, confine animals in cramped and unsanitary conditions, subjecting them to inhumane treatment and denying them basic rights. Similarly, some pet owners neglect their animals' needs, leaving them malnourished and without proper care.However, this is a misguided approach. Rather than treating animals as commodities or objects to be used for our benefit, we should behave as guardians, ensuring their well-being and safety. Animals are living beings with feelings, needs, and rights, just like humans. They have the capacity to experience joy, pain, and suffering, and it is our responsibility to protect them from harm.As guardians, we should prioritize animal welfare, providing them with adequate food, shelter, and care. We should also recognize their rights, such as the right to freedom from cruelty, neglect, and exploitation. By adopting this approach, we can work towards creating a more compassionate and equitable society, where humans and animals coexist in harmony.In conclusion, while many people encourage the use of animals for personal needs, it is crucial that we prioritize their welfare and treat them with respect and kindness. As humans, we have a moral obligation to act as guardians, rather than lords or masters, ensuring that animals are protected and treated with the dignity they deserve.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";The notion that museums and art galleries will soon become obsolete due to the advent of modern technology has been a topic of debate in recent years. While some may argue that the digital age has rendered these institutions unnecessary, I firmly believe that their importance cannot be overstated, particularly in terms of education and culture.Museums and art galleries have long been revered as sacred spaces where people can engage with the past, learn about different cultures, and appreciate the beauty of art. The physical presence of authentic exhibits, such as ancient artifacts, paintings, and sculptures, cannot be replicated by images and videos alone. The tactile experience of beholding a masterpiece or handling a historical relic is essential to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the subject matter. The nuances of texture, color, and scale are often lost in digital representations, making the physical encounter an indispensable aspect of the learning process.Furthermore, museums and art galleries serve as cultural hubs, fostering a sense of community and social cohesion. They provide a platform for people to gather, share ideas, and engage in discussions about art, history, and culture. The museum experience is not just about observing artifacts, but also about participating in a collective experience that transcends geographical and temporal boundaries.In conclusion, while modern technology has undoubtedly enhanced our access to information, it is no substitute for the authentic experience offered by museums and art galleries. These institutions will continue to play a vital role in educating and enriching our lives, and their importance will only continue to grow as we navigate an increasingly digital world. By preserving and showcasing our cultural heritage, museums and art galleries ensure that future generations will have a tangible connection to the past, and a deeper understanding of the world we inhabit today.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;"The age-old debate on whether students should be taught a wide range of subjects or focus on a single subject has sparked intense discussion among educators, parents, and policymakers. On one hand, some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children, believing that exposure to various subjects helps foster well-roundedness, creativity, and critical thinking skills. They argue that studying multiple subjects broadens a student's perspective, allowing them to develop a deeper understanding of the world and its complexities.On the other hand, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective, as it enables students to delve deeper into a specific area of interest, developing a stronger foundation and expertise. Proponents of this approach argue that the current curriculum is too broad, leading to a superficial understanding of many subjects, rather than a profound grasp of a single one. By focusing on one subject, students can cultivate a passion for learning and achieve greater academic success.Furthermore, some parents believe that the traditional model of teaching multiple subjects can lead to a ""jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none"" scenario, where students are not given the opportunity to explore their interests in-depth. In contrast, a single-subject approach allows students to pursue their passions and develop a sense of purpose, leading to greater motivation and engagement in the learning process.However, critics of the single-subject approach argue that it can limit students' opportunities and create a narrow perspective. They contend that a broad education provides students with a more comprehensive understanding of the world, enabling them to navigate complex problems and think critically.Ultimately, the decision to teach students all subjects or focus on one subject depends on individual learning styles, goals, and priorities. While some students thrive in a multifaceted educational environment, others may benefit from a more specialized approach."
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;The widespread use of English has become a phenomenon that has been debated by scholars and linguists alike. While some argue that it has negative effects on local cultures and languages, I firmly believe that the prevalent usage of English brings numerous benefits to individuals and countries worldwide.In my country, the importance of English has been recognized from a young age, with it being a required course from elementary school. This has enabled students to develop a strong foundation in the language, making it easier for them to pursue higher education abroad. As a result, studying abroad has become increasingly popular among youngsters, providing them with opportunities to experience different cultures, broaden their perspectives, and gain a competitive edge in the job market.Moreover, researchers, particularly those in high-tech fields, greatly benefit from proficiency in English. With the majority of academic and technical resources available in English, being good at the language grants them access to a vast array of references, journals, and research papers. This, in turn, enables them to stay updated with the latest developments in their field, collaborate with international peers, and contribute meaningfully to their area of expertise.Furthermore, the use of English as a global language facilitates international communication, trade, and diplomacy. It has become the language of business, science, and technology, bridging gaps between nations and fostering cooperation. In conclusion, while there may be some negative effects of the widespread use of English, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh them. By embracing English, individuals and countries can tap into a world of opportunities, expand their horizons, and participate actively in the global community.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";"The age-old adage, ""creativity originates in a free mind,"" holds significant relevance in today's fast-paced, interconnected world. This phrase underscores the importance of providing artists with the liberty to express their ideas without any constraints. Just as a free-flowing river nourishes the landscape, a free mind nourishes creativity, allowing it to flourish and blossom.Artists, in particular, require this freedom to bring their imagination to life. When unencumbered by restrictions, they can delve into the depths of their thoughts, experiment with innovative ideas, and push the boundaries of their craft. This is why creative artists must be given the freedom to express themselves without any censorship or strict guidelines. By doing so, we enable them to tap into their full potential, fostering an environment that encourages creativity to thrive.However, this freedom comes with a responsibility. Just as the media must ensure that their content does not infringe upon the rights and sentiments of others, artists must also exercise restraint in their creative endeavors. They must be mindful of the impact their work may have on society, avoiding content that may be offensive, hurtful, or inflammatory. This is not to say that artists should self-censor their work, but rather, they should strive to create content that is thought-provoking, yet respectful of diverse perspectives and cultures.By striking this balance, artists can continue to push the boundaries of their craft while also contributing positively to the world around them. In doing so, they not only create art that is meaningful and impactful but also foster a culture of creativity, empathy, and understanding. As we continue to navigate the complexities of our increasingly interconnected world, it is essential that we recognize the importance of freedom in fostering creativity and the responsibility that comes with it."
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;"The age-old debate surrounding the merits of cooperation and competition has been a longstanding one, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. However, it is essential to acknowledge that these two seemingly opposing concepts are, in fact, two sides of the same coin. They are intricately linked and cannot be separated. This essay will explore how cooperation and competition coexist and complement each other, ultimately driving progress and growth.On one hand, competition has been a driving force behind the rapid development of science and technology. The desire to outdo others has spurred innovation, leading to groundbreaking discoveries and advancements. For instance, the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War era led to significant breakthroughs in rocketry, materials science, and computer technology. This competitive spirit has pushed the boundaries of human knowledge, enabling us to achieve the impossible.On the other hand, a ""your loss, my gain"" kind of competition, where one person's success comes at the expense of another, can never be fruitful in the long run. This zero-sum approach creates an environment of cutthroat rivalry, where individuals prioritize their own interests over the well-being of others. Such a mindset can lead to mistrust, sabotage, and a breakdown of relationships, ultimately hindering collective progress.In contrast, cooperation allows individuals to work together towards a common goal, sharing knowledge, skills, and resources. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of community, encouraging open communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. Cooperation also promotes a culture of constructive feedback, enabling individuals to grow and improve together.In conclusion, cooperation and competition are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary forces that drive progress and growth. While competition can spur innovation, cooperation provides the foundation for sustainable success. By embracing both aspects, we can create an environment that values collective achievement, mutual respect, and the betterment of society as a whole. Ultimately, the interplay between cooperation and competition is what propels us forward, allowing us to reach new heights and achieve greatness together."
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";"The concept of punishment has been a cornerstone of the criminal justice system, serving as a deterrent to potential offenders. The notion that ""crime is always punishable"" is rooted in the idea of retribution, which seeks to punish individuals for their wrongdoing. This approach is based on the principle that criminals should be held accountable for their actions and face consequences proportionate to the severity of their crimes.However, it is essential to note that not all crimes warrant the same level of punishment. In extreme cases, capital punishment may be deemed necessary, but only in the ""rarest of the rare"" instances. This means that the death penalty is reserved for crimes that are exceptionally heinous, premeditated, and deliberate, leaving no room for doubt about the guilt of the perpetrator.The underlying assumption is that when a criminal mind is aware of the quantum of punishment they may face, they will be deterred from committing such crimes in the first place. This theory, known as specific deterrence, suggests that the fear of punishment will prevent individuals from engaging in criminal behavior. While the effectiveness of this approach is debated among criminologists, it is undeniable that the prospect of severe punishment can have a chilling effect on potential offenders.Moreover, the certainty and severity of punishment can also have a broader impact on society. By establishing clear consequences for criminal behavior, individuals are more likely to think twice before engaging in illicit activities. This, in turn, contributes to a safer and more law-abiding society.In conclusion, the principle that crime is always punishable serves as a foundation for the criminal justice system. Through retribution and proportionate punishment, including capital punishment in extreme cases, the system aims to deter criminal behavior and maintain social order. By making individuals aware of the consequences of their actions, the hope is that they will be discouraged from committing crimes in the first place, ultimately contributing to a safer and more just society."
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;The decision to take a gap year, or a break from studies, is a topic of debate in many countries. While some view it as a waste of time, others see it as a valuable opportunity for personal growth and exploration.In most education systems, children study continuously from the age of five to 16, without any significant break. However, research has shown that taking a gap year can have numerous benefits for young minds. A relaxation of one year can provide a much-needed break from the rigors of academia, allowing students to recharge and refocus. It also gives them the chance to explore their interests and passions, which can help them discover their field of study.Working or traveling during a gap year can be particularly beneficial. It provides students with real-world experience, teaching them valuable skills such as time management, budgeting, and independence. Traveling, in particular, broadens one's perspective, exposing them to different cultures, ways of life, and ideas. These experiences can be transformative, helping students develop a sense of purpose and direction.Moreover, a gap year can also help students make more informed decisions about their academic and career paths. By taking the time to explore their interests and passions, students can make more informed choices about their field of study, rather than rushing into a program without careful consideration. This, in turn, can lead to greater success and satisfaction in their chosen field.In conclusion, taking a gap year can be a valuable investment in one's education and personal growth. Rather than viewing it as a waste of time, it should be seen as an opportunity to recharge, explore, and discover. By embracing the concept of a gap year, we can provide young minds with the space to grow, develop, and flourish, leading to a more successful and fulfilling academic and professional journey.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";The advent of computers has undoubtedly given a whole new dimension to human life. Over the years, the world has become increasingly dependent on computers, and it is impossible to imagine a world without them. Computers have revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate, making life easier, more convenient, and faster than ever before.The impact of computers on our daily lives is multifaceted. They have enabled us to access a vast amount of information at the click of a button, communicate with people across the globe in real-time, and perform complex tasks with unprecedented speed and accuracy. From banking and finance to healthcare and education, computers have transformed the way we conduct our daily affairs. The ease and convenience they offer have saved us time, energy, and resources, allowing us to focus on more creative and productive pursuits.However, as with every technological advancement, there are pros and cons to the widespread use of computers. While they have opened up new avenues for learning, communication, and entertainment, they have also led to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to health problems such as obesity and eye strain. Moreover, the excessive reliance on computers has made us vulnerable to cyber threats, data breaches, and other forms of digital malfeasance.Despite these drawbacks, the benefits of computers far outweigh the drawbacks. As we continue to harness the power of computers to improve our lives, it is essential to acknowledge and address the negative consequences. By promoting responsible computer use, ensuring online security, and encouraging a balance between technology and physical activity, we can maximize the advantages of computers while minimizing their risks. In conclusion, computers have transformed human life in ways that were previously unimaginable, and their impact will only continue to grow as technology advances.
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;The concept of co-education has been a topic of debate for centuries. While some argue that separate institutions for males and females are beneficial, others believe that co-education is the key to a harmonious and progressive society. In my opinion, co-education plays a pivotal role in helping both genders gel well with each other, thereby breaking down gender stereotypes and fostering a more inclusive environment.One of the primary advantages of co-education is that it provides an opportunity for males and females to interact with each other in a formal setting. This interaction helps to dispel misconceptions and biases that are often prevalent in our society. For instance, some male chauvinists believe that women are incapable of excelling in particular fields such as mathematics, mechanical engineering, and defense. This kind of gender-biased approach is not only detrimental to the development of the society but also hampers the growth and potential of women.Co-education helps to break down these stereotypes by providing women with equal opportunities to participate in these fields. When males and females study together, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, leading to a more balanced and respectful relationship. Moreover, co-education enables women to challenge the misconceptions and biases that are often perpetuated by a patriarchal society.In conclusion, co-education is essential for the development of a harmonious and progressive society. It helps to break down gender stereotypes, fosters a more inclusive environment, and provides women with equal opportunities to participate in various fields. As we move forward in the 21st century, it is imperative that we recognize the importance of co-education and work towards creating a society that values equality, mutual respect, and cooperation between males and females.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;The Role of Traditional Games in Children's GrowthGames have long been an integral part of childhood, playing a significant role in shaping children's abilities and personalities. In today's world, where modern digital games dominate the scene, I firmly believe that parents and educators should place greater emphasis on traditional games. These timeless games have been a staple of childhood for centuries, and their benefits are numerous.One of the primary merits of traditional games is that they foster communication skills in children. Unlike modern digital games, which often involve solo play and minimal interaction, traditional games require players to interact with each other, promoting verbal and non-verbal communication. Games like tag, hide and seek, and board games encourage children to express themselves, listen to others, and develop essential social skills. These skills are crucial for building strong relationships and achieving success in all aspects of life.In contrast, modern digital games are often developed by game companies with the primary goal of generating profits. While they may offer some benefits, such as improved problem-solving skills and hand-eye coordination, they lack the social interaction and community-building aspects of traditional games. Moreover, excessive screen time has been linked to various health problems, including obesity, eye strain, and decreased attention span.In conclusion, traditional games offer a wide range of benefits that are essential for children's growth and development. By incorporating these games into their daily lives, children can develop vital communication skills, build strong relationships, and cultivate a sense of community. As parents and educators, it is our responsibility to promote these games and ensure that they continue to play a significant role in shaping the next generation. By doing so, we can help children develop into well-rounded, socially adept individuals who are equipped to succeed in all areas of life.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The allocation of government funds is a contentious issue, with some arguing that investing in medical care and education should take precedence over entertaining or sports facilities. This viewpoint prioritizes the essential needs of citizens, ensuring that they have access to quality healthcare and education. In contrast, investing in entertainment and sports facilities is seen as a luxury that not all taxpayers can utilize or benefit from.Providing medical care and education are fundamental responsibilities of any government, as they directly impact the well-being and productivity of its citizens. A healthy and educated population is better equipped to contribute to the economy and society as a whole. On the other hand, entertainment and sports facilities, while enjoyable, are not essential to the basic needs of citizens. Moreover, these facilities often cater to a specific segment of the population, leaving many others without access or interest in using them.Furthermore, the use of taxpayers' money to fund entertainment and sports projects can be seen as unfair to those who do not benefit from them. Taxpayers expect their money to be used for essential public services, not for discretionary purposes that may only benefit a select few. This raises questions about the equitable distribution of public funds and the accountability of government spending.In conclusion, prioritizing medical care and education over entertainment and sports facilities is a sensible approach for any government. These essential services are critical to the welfare and development of citizens, and their funding is a justified use of taxpayers' money. In contrast, investing in entertainment and sports facilities should be secondary to meeting the fundamental needs of the population.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;The advent of modern technology has sparked a debate about its impact on traditional techniques and lifestyles. While some people worry that technology may hinder the preservation of these cultural practices, it can be argued that technology actually plays a crucial role in promoting traditional skills and ways of life.One of the primary advantages of technology in this context is its ability to transcend time and space. Traditional skills and practices are often limited to specific geographic locations and are typically passed down through generations by word of mouth. However, with the aid of technology, these skills can be digitized and shared globally, reaching a wider audience and facilitating their preservation.Moreover, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote traditional skills. For instance, online platforms and social media can be used to showcase and teach traditional crafts, music, and art forms. Virtual reality experiences can transport people to different cultural settings, allowing them to experience and appreciate traditional ways of life. Additionally, digital archives and databases can be created to store and preserve traditional knowledge, making it easily accessible to future generations.Furthermore, technology can also help to revive dying traditional practices by providing a platform for people to learn and engage with them. Online communities and forums can be created to connect people who share an interest in traditional skills, facilitating the exchange of ideas and knowledge. This not only helps to preserve traditional practices but also enables their evolution and adaptation to modern contexts.In conclusion, rather than being a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles, technology plays a vital role in promoting and preserving these cultural practices. By bridging time and space, technology makes it possible to share, learn, and engage with traditional skills more efficiently and effectively.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";The debate over artistic freedom has long been a contentious issue, with some arguing that artists have been granted too much liberty and power. Proponents of this view advocate for government intervention to restrict the creative expressions of artists, citing concerns that their work may mislead or destabilize society. In stark contrast, I firmly believe that the freedom to express thoughts and ideas is a fundamental right that should always be upheld.One of the primary concerns driving the call for restrictions on artistic freedom is the fear of social misleading. Critics argue that certain artworks may promote values, beliefs, or lifestyles that are deemed detrimental to societal cohesion and stability. They fear that such creations may influence public opinion, shape cultural norms, and ultimately threaten the established order. However, this concern is often rooted in a paternalistic assumption that the masses are incapable of critical thinking and discernment.Restricting artistic freedom would be a regressive step, as it would stifle the very essence of creativity and innovation. Artists have long played a crucial role in challenging societal norms, pushing boundaries, and sparking meaningful discussions. By placing undue constraints on their work, we risk silencing important voices and stifling progress. The arts have always been a powerful tool for social commentary, critique, and transformation. Curtailing artistic freedom would be tantamount to suppressing the exchange of ideas, hindering our ability to engage with complex issues, and undermining the very fabric of our democracy.Ultimately, the freedom to express thoughts and ideas is a cornerstone of a healthy, functioning society. Rather than imposing restrictions on artistic expression, we should focus on fostering a culture of critical thinking, media literacy, and open dialogue. By doing so, we can ensure that artistic creations, in all their forms and complexities, continue to enrich our lives, challenge our assumptions, and inspire positive change.
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The portrayal of violence in the media has become a topic of concern in recent years. While it is undeniable that violence is a reality in our world and must be reported, the way it is often depicted in the media is a subject of debate. The tendency to portray violence as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences has led to a culture of sensationalism, where the boundaries of what is acceptable are constantly pushed.On one hand, it is essential to report on violent incidents in order to inform the public and spark important conversations. However, when the media focuses on the most graphic and disturbing aspects of violence, it can create a distorted view of reality. Excessive violence in the media can desensitize audiences, making them more accepting of aggressive behavior and less empathetic towards victims. Furthermore, it can also perpetuate negative stereotypes and reinforce harmful attitudes towards certain groups, exacerbating social tensions and conflicts.The impact of excessive violence in the media on society is detrimental. It can contribute to a culture of fear and aggression, where individuals feel justified in using violence to resolve conflicts or express themselves. This, in turn, can lead to an increase in violent behavior, creating a vicious cycle of aggression and retaliation. Moreover, it can also have a profound impact on children and adolescents, who are still developing their moral compass and may be influenced by the violent images and messages they are exposed to.In conclusion, while it is necessary to report on violence in the media, it is equally important to do so in a responsible and balanced manner. The media has a duty to inform and educate the public, rather than to sensationalize and exploit violent incidents for the sake of ratings. By promoting a more nuanced and thoughtful portrayal of violence, we can work towards creating a more empathetic and peaceful society.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";The modern era has been a witness to profound changes in most aspects of life, and one of the most significant transformations has been the revolution of feminism. Feminism, which advocates for equal rights and opportunities for women, has been a topic of debate among scholars and the general public. While some people may view the feminist movement as a challenge to traditional societal norms, I firmly believe that it is a positive progression in human society.In a society where females are given equal opportunities compared to males, numerous benefits can be reaped. Firstly, the empowerment of women leads to a more equitable distribution of resources and wealth. When women have access to education and employment opportunities, they are able to contribute to the economy and support themselves and their families. This, in turn, reduces poverty and increases economic growth.Moreover, a society that values gender equality promotes diversity and creativity. When women are given a platform to express themselves and share their ideas, they bring unique perspectives and innovative solutions to the table. This diversity of thought and approach leads to more effective problem-solving and decision-making.Additionally, feminism promotes social justice and human rights. By recognizing the inherent value and dignity of every individual, regardless of gender, feminism encourages a culture of respect and inclusivity. This, in turn, leads to a more harmonious and peaceful society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.While there may be some obstacles to achieving gender equality, such as entrenched patriarchal attitudes and institutional barriers, I firmly believe that the benefits of feminism far outweigh these challenges. In conclusion, the feminist movement has been a positive progression in human society, promoting economic growth, diversity, and social justice. As we continue to work towards a more equal and inclusive society, we must recognize the value and contributions of women and girls, and strive to create a world where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";Title: The Feasibility of Price Control Institutions in Alleviating Traffic and PollutionPrice control institutions have been employed in various social areas, such as the regulation of farm products and real estate markets. However, the question remains as to whether this approach can be effective in mitigating traffic congestion and pollution. In this essay, we will examine the potential of price control institutions in addressing these pressing environmental issues.On the one hand, price control mechanisms have proven to be successful in regulating the supply and demand of certain goods and services. For instance, in the agricultural sector, price controls have helped stabilize the market and ensure a fair price for farmers. Similarly, in the real estate market, price controls have prevented exorbitant price hikes and promoted affordable housing. Applying this concept to traffic and pollution, one possible solution is to impose congestion pricing, where drivers are charged a fee to enter certain areas or use specific roads during peak hours. This could reduce the number of vehicles on the road, subsequently decreasing air pollution and traffic congestion.However, pollution is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to traffic congestion. Other significant contributors to pollution include the burning of fossil fuels, chemical pollutants, and excessive lighting. These factors highlight the need for a multifaceted approach to addressing pollution. Price control institutions, while potentially effective in reducing traffic-related pollution, may not be enough to tackle the broader pollution problem.In conclusion, while price control institutions have been effective in various social areas, their application in alleviating traffic and pollution pressure is not straightforward. Further evaluation is needed to assess the effectiveness of such an approach, taking into account the diverse sources of pollution.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The primary objective of public service advertisements is not to generate profits, but to serve a higher purpose. Unlike commercial advertisements, which focus on promoting products and services to boost sales, public service advertisements aim to disseminate valued culture, promote good moral traits, and raise awareness about social issues. These advertisements play a crucial role in shaping societal values and norms, and in promoting the well-being of marginalized communities, such as the disabled and the poor.Public service advertisements often address pressing social concerns, such as poverty, inequality, and disability. By highlighting the struggles faced by these communities, these advertisements raise awareness about the issues and encourage viewers to take action. For instance, public service advertisements may promote fundraising campaigns for charities that support people with disabilities or advocate for policies that benefit low-income families. By doing so, these advertisements inspire empathy, kindness, and social responsibility among viewers.In contrast, commercial advertisements on mass media platforms primarily aim to promote brand image or specific products. While these advertisements can be effective in boosting sales and revenue for companies, they often prioritize profit over social responsibility. However, when companies integrate public service advertisements into their marketing strategies, they can reap benefits beyond mere financial gains. By promoting social causes and values, companies can enhance their brand reputation, build trust with their customers, and contribute to the greater good.In conclusion, public service advertisements play a vital role in promoting valued culture, good moral traits, and social responsibility. By using mass media platforms to raise awareness about social issues and promote positive values, these advertisements inspire viewers to take action and make a positive impact. Unlike commercial advertisements, which focus on profit, public service advertisements prioritize the well-being of society, making them an essential component of any responsible marketing strategy.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;"The fast pace of modern life often leaves people facing numerous difficulties and high levels of stress. In this essay, I will argue that the most effective method of stress reduction in modern society is through various forms of exercise.Exercise is a multifaceted activity that not only improves physical health conditions but also has a profound impact on mental well-being. Regular physical activity has been proven to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, common afflictions of modern life. The release of endorphins during exercise, also known as ""feel-good"" hormones, contributes to improved mood and reduced stress levels. Furthermore, exercise provides an opportunity for individuals to take a break from the pressures of daily life, allowing them to clear their minds and gain perspective.In addition to its mental health benefits, exercise also offers a sense of accomplishment and self-efficacy. Setting and achieving fitness goals can boost self-confidence, translating to other areas of life and enabling individuals to better cope with stress. Moreover, exercise can be adapted to suit various lifestyles and preferences, making it an accessible stress-reduction method for people from all walks of life.In conclusion, the demands of modern life can be overwhelming, but exercise offers a powerful tool for managing stress. By incorporating physical activity into their daily routines, individuals can improve their overall health, enhance their mental well-being, and develop the resilience needed to navigate life's challenges. As such, I firmly believe that exercise is the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people, providing a holistic approach to maintaining physical and mental health in today's fast-paced world."
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";"The age-old adage ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" has been a cornerstone of communication for centuries. This maxim suggests that a single image can convey a vast amount of information, emotions, and ideas more effectively than a multitude of written words. While I concur with this notion to a certain extent, particularly in today's visually-driven world, I firmly believe that the significance of the written word cannot be overlooked.In today's digital landscape, images have become an indispensable means of communication. With the rise of social media, memes, and infographics, visuals have taken center stage in conveying messages, telling stories, and evoking emotions. A single image can instantly capture attention, convey complex ideas, and transcend linguistic and cultural barriers. For instance, a photograph of a natural disaster can instantly convey the magnitude of destruction, while a simple logo can represent a brand's values and mission.However, the written word remains an equally vital means of communication. Words possess the power to articulate thoughts, convey nuanced emotions, and provide context, which images often cannot. The written word allows for precision, clarity, and depth, enabling readers to engage with complex ideas, form opinions, and make informed decisions. Moreover, written communication is often more durable, allowing messages to be preserved and transmitted over time, whereas images can be fleeting and ephemeral.Furthermore, the written word is essential in many professions, such as law, academia, and journalism, where accuracy, precision, and clarity are paramount. In these fields, images can supplement written content, but they cannot replace the need for well-crafted words.In conclusion, while images have become an increasingly effective means of communication, the importance of the written word cannot be denied. Both images and words have their unique strengths and weaknesses, and effective communication often relies on a combination of both. By acknowledging the value of both visual and written communication, we can harness the power of each to convey our messages, tell our stories, and connect with others in meaningful ways."
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;The notion that governments should allocate a portion of their budget to preserve minority languages has garnered significant attention in recent years. While some people firmly believe in the importance of conserving these languages, others remain skeptical about the efficacy of such measures. In my opinion, this viewpoint warrants thorough examination, and this essay aims to delve into the intricacies of this issue.On the one hand, there are some drawbacks to saving minority languages. Firstly, investing in the preservation of minority languages can divert resources away from more pressing societal needs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Governments have limited budgets, and allocating funds to support minority languages might mean sacrificing other essential public services. Additionally, the number of speakers of minority languages is often relatively small, which raises questions about the practicality of investing in their preservation. For instance, if a language has only a handful of speakers, is it worth expending valuable resources to keep it alive?Furthermore, some argue that the natural process of language evolution and cultural assimilation is a natural part of human history. Languages have always risen and fallen, and it is inevitable that some will eventually become extinct. By attempting to artificially preserve minority languages, governments may be interfering with the natural course of linguistic and cultural development.On the other hand, preserving minority languages can have significant cultural and social benefits. Minority languages often contain unique cultural knowledge, customs, and histories that are essential to the identity of the communities that speak them. By preserving these languages, governments can help maintain the cultural diversity of their nations and promote a sense of inclusivity and belonging among minority groups.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;As the government continues to allocate its resources, it is imperative that priority is given to investing in basic social welfare programs, specifically education and housing. While art and cultural development are often touted as essential components of a quality life, it is, in fact, education that plays the pivotal role in determining the overall well-being of a society.Education is the foundation upon which a well-rounded social system is built. It is the key to unlocking individual potential, fostering critical thinking, and promoting social mobility. By investing in education, the government can ensure that its citizens are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to participate fully in the economy, make informed decisions, and contribute to the betterment of society.In contrast, while art and cultural programs may bring joy and enrichment to people's lives, they are not the primary drivers of social progress. A society that prioritizes art over education is unlikely to achieve lasting improvements in the quality of life for its citizens. Education, on the other hand, has a direct and tangible impact on individuals and society as a whole.Furthermore, education is the guarantor of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives. By providing access to quality education, the government can empower its citizens to make informed decisions about their health, financial stability, and overall well-being. Education also promotes social cohesion, tolerance, and understanding, all of which are essential components of a harmonious and prosperous society.In conclusion, the government should prioritize investing in education and housing over art and cultural programs. By doing so, it can ensure that its citizens are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in life, and that the overall quality of life for its citizens is improved. Education is the key to unlocking a better future, and it is the government's responsibility to provide its citizens with the tools they need to succeed.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;The provision of healthcare and education are two of the most fundamental responsibilities of any government. Some people believe that the government should be obligated to fund the health care and education for all its citizens. I strongly agree with this sentiment, especially when it comes to providing healthcare for the underprivileged.On one hand, proponents of government-funded healthcare and education argue that it is the duty of the state to ensure that all its citizens have access to basic necessities like healthcare and education. They believe that by doing so, the government can create a more equitable society where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their socio-economic background. This argument is compelling, as it acknowledges that not everyone has the means to afford quality healthcare and education.On the other hand, opponents of government-funded healthcare and education argue that it is a waste of public money. They believe that the government should focus on providing other essential services like infrastructure, defense, and law and order, rather than subsidizing the healthcare and education of its citizens. They also argue that government-funded healthcare and education can lead to inefficiencies and corruption, as the government may not be able to manage these services effectively.However, I believe that the government should fund the healthcare of its deprived citizens. Healthcare is a fundamental human right, and it is the duty of the government to ensure that all its citizens have access to quality healthcare, regardless of their income or social status. By providing free or subsidized healthcare to the underprivileged, the government can improve their overall quality of life, reduce poverty and inequality, and create a more just and equitable society.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that the government should fund the healthcare of its deprived citizens. This is not only a moral obligation, but also a sound investment in the future of the country. By providing quality healthcare to all its citizens, the government can create a healthier, more productive, and more prosperous society.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;The debate on whether zoos should be banned has been a contentious issue among animal-right activists. While some strongly advocate that wildlife belongs in their natural environment and zoos should be abolished, I respectfully disagree with this viewpoint. In my opinion, a well-designed, man-made environment can be a better alternative for wild animals, providing them with a longer lifespan and serving as a platform for promoting animal protection.First and foremost, a good man-made environment can be tailored to meet the specific needs of various species, ensuring their physical and psychological well-being. Modern zoos are equipped with state-of-the-art facilities that mimic the natural habitats of animals, complete with adequate space, suitable climate, and nutritious diets. This controlled environment can actually prolong the life span of wild animals, as they are protected from threats such as poaching, habitat destruction, and disease outbreaks that are prevalent in their natural habitats.Moreover, zoos can play a crucial role in cultivating the notion of protecting animals among the general public, especially children. By providing an up-close and personal experience with wild animals, zoos can foster empathy, appreciation, and understanding of the importance of conservation. Educational programs and interactive exhibits can also raise awareness about the plight of endangered species and the need for conservation efforts. This can inspire a new generation of animal lovers and conservationists, who can make a positive impact on the welfare of wild animals.In conclusion, while animal-right activists may argue that zoos are inherently cruel and should be banned, I believe that a well-designed, man-made environment can be a better alternative for wild animals. By providing a safe and nurturing space for animals, zoos can not only prolong their lifespan but also serve as a platform for promoting animal protection and conservation.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;The notion that economic targets and environmental preservation are mutually exclusive has sparked intense debate. While some individuals express concern that industrialized nations may prioritize economic growth at the expense of ecosystems, I firmly believe that thriving economies and environmental conservation can coexist harmoniously.On one hand, it is undeniable that some countries have historically placed economic development ahead of environmental protection, resulting in devastating consequences for local ecosystems. The relentless pursuit of growth and profit has led to deforestation, habitat destruction, and pollution, compromising the health and well-being of both humans and wildlife. However, I argue that this approach is not only unsustainable but also short-sighted.In contrast, many countries have demonstrated that economic prosperity and environmental stewardship can be achieved simultaneously. For instance, Costa Rica's commitment to sustainable tourism has not only boosted its economy but also preserved its lush rainforests and biodiversity. Similarly, Norway's emphasis on renewable energy has enabled the country to reduce its carbon footprint while maintaining a strong economy.In my opinion, the key to reconciling economic growth with environmental protection lies in adopting sustainable practices and policies. Governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to invest in eco-friendly technologies, renewable energy sources, and sustainable agriculture. By doing so, we can create jobs, stimulate innovation, and reduce our ecological footprint.In conclusion, I firmly believe that flourishing economies and environmental preservation are not mutually exclusive. With vision, cooperation, and a commitment to sustainability, we can achieve economic targets while safeguarding the natural world for future generations. It is our responsibility to ensure that economic development is pursued in harmony with environmental protection, rather than at its expense.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;The allocation of tax money is a contentious issue, with some arguing that it should be channeled solely into public services, while others, like myself, believe that arts should also be a recipient of government investment. While public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure are undoubtedly essential, I firmly believe that arts play a vital role in the fabric of our society and should not be overlooked.Arts are often viewed as a luxury, a nice-to-have but not a necessity. However, this perspective neglects the significant benefits that arts bring to our communities. Arts have the power to inspire, educate, and unite people across cultures and generations. They provide a platform for self-expression, creativity, and social commentary, fostering a more empathetic and informed society. Moreover, arts contribute to the economy, generating revenue through tourism, job creation, and cultural exports.Investing in arts also has a positive impact on our collective well-being. Studies have shown that engaging with arts can reduce stress, improve mental health, and even alleviate symptoms of dementia. Furthermore, arts programs in schools have been proven to improve academic performance, particularly among disadvantaged students.In addition, arts are a reflection of our cultural identity and heritage. By investing in arts, we are preserving our history, promoting cultural diversity, and showcasing our unique perspectives to the world. This, in turn, enhances our national pride, attracting tourists and investors who value our rich cultural landscape.In conclusion, while public services are undoubtedly essential, I strongly believe that arts should also be a priority for government investment. By allocating tax money to arts, we are investing in our collective well-being, cultural diversity, and economic growth. Arts are not a luxury, but a necessity that enriches our lives, fosters creativity, and brings people together.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;The debate surrounding zoology has been a longstanding one, with critics and advocates presenting compelling arguments for and against the practice of keeping animals in captivity. Critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is inherently wrong, as it denies them their fundamental right to freedom. They contend that animals should be considered non-human persons, with inherent dignity and autonomy, and that captivity is a form of exploitation and oppression.On the other hand, advocates of zoology argue that zoos and wildlife parks provide the public with a unique opportunity for entertainment and education. They claim that these institutions play a crucial role in promoting conservation efforts and raising awareness about the importance of preserving biodiversity. Furthermore, advocates argue that zoos help to maintain ecological balance by providing a controlled environment for breeding programs, species reintroduction, and research initiatives.While critics' concerns about animal welfare are valid, it is also important to acknowledge the benefits that zoos provide. Many zoos have evolved to prioritize animal well-being, providing naturalistic habitats and enrichment programs that promote animal behavior and mental stimulation. Moreover, zoos have contributed significantly to conservation efforts, such as the reintroduction of endangered species and the development of breeding programs for threatened populations.In conclusion, the debate surrounding zoology is complex and multifaceted. While critics' concerns about animal rights and welfare are legitimate, advocates' arguments about the benefits of zoos in promoting conservation and education should not be dismissed. Ultimately, a nuanced approach is necessary, one that balances animal welfare with the potential benefits of zoos. By supporting zoos that prioritize animal well-being and conservation, we can work towards a future where both humans and animals can coexist and thrive.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;The impact of advertising on our lives has been a topic of ongoing debate. While many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to our lives, making it a positive activity, others argue against it due to its negative impacts.On the one hand, advertising has revolutionized the way we consume goods and services. It has enabled businesses to reach a wider audience, promoting their products and services to people who may not have been aware of them otherwise. This has led to increased sales, economic growth, and job creation. Furthermore, advertising has also played a significant role in shaping our culture and society. It has influenced our attitudes, values, and lifestyles, often reflecting and shaping societal norms.On the other hand, there are several negative impacts of advertising that cannot be ignored. One of the most significant concerns is the invasion of privacy. With the advancement of technology, a huge amount of different advertisements can be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses. This can be overwhelming and annoying, leading to a sense of frustration and resentment towards advertising. Moreover, advertising can also be deceptive and misleading, leading to false expectations and disappointment.Another concern is the promotion of unhealthy and unsustainable lifestyles. Many advertisements promote products that are high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, contributing to the growing obesity and health epidemics. Additionally, advertising can also perpetuate unsustainable consumption patterns, encouraging people to buy more than they need, leading to waste and environmental degradation.In conclusion, while advertising has brought many benefits to our lives, its negative impacts cannot be ignored. It is essential to strike a balance between promoting goods and services and respecting individual privacy and well-being. Advertising companies must be responsible and ethical in their practices, promoting healthy and sustainable lifestyles, rather than just focusing on profits.
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;The topic of nuclear technology has been a contentious issue for years, with proponents arguing that it provides a reliable and cost-effective source of energy. However, as the debate rages on, I find myself firmly aligned with the opponents of nuclear power.While it is true that nuclear power has the potential to generate a significant amount of electricity, I firmly believe that the risks associated with it far outweigh any potential benefits. One of the primary concerns is the issue of nuclear waste disposal. The byproducts of nuclear reactions are highly radioactive and hazardous, and the world has yet to develop a foolproof method of disposing of them. The consequences of improper disposal are catastrophic, as evident from the devastating effects of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters.Moreover, the possibility of nuclear accidents is ever-present, and the potential consequences are dire. The impact on human health, the environment, and the economy would be severe and long-lasting. The emotional and psychological trauma inflicted on communities affected by nuclear disasters is immeasurable.Furthermore, the development and deployment of nuclear technology divert resources away from renewable energy sources, which are cleaner, safer, and more sustainable. Solar and wind power, for example, have made tremendous strides in recent years, and with continued investment, they hold great promise for our energy future.In conclusion, while proponents of nuclear power may argue that it provides a reliable source of energy, I firmly believe that the risks and consequences associated with its use far outweigh any benefits. As we move forward, it is imperative that we prioritize the development and deployment of renewable energy sources, and gradually phase out our reliance on nuclear power. Our planet, our health, and our future depend on it.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;Big cities have often been misconstrued as unsuitable places for bringing up children. However, this notion couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, big cities provide numerous benefits for children's development, education, and overall well-being.One of the primary advantages of raising children in big cities is the access to better educational institutions. Schools in urban areas tend to have more resources, experienced teachers, and a wider range of extracurricular activities, which can significantly enhance a child's learning experience. In contrast, schools in rural areas often face challenges such as limited funding, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. As a result, children living in big cities have a higher chance of receiving a quality education, which is essential for their future success.Another benefit of big cities is the abundance of creative facilities that cater to children's diverse interests. Urban areas are often equipped with museums, libraries, theaters, and sports centers, which provide children with a platform to explore their passions and develop their talents. These facilities not only promote cognitive development but also foster social skills, creativity, and emotional intelligence. In contrast, children living in rural areas often have limited access to such facilities, which can hinder their overall development.In rural areas, children often spend most of their free time helping with farm work or engaging in outdoor activities, which, although valuable, can be limiting in terms of exposure to different experiences. In contrast, children in big cities are exposed to a diverse range of cultures, lifestyles, and opportunities, which can broaden their perspective and help them become more adaptable and resilient.In conclusion, big cities are not only suitable but also ideal places for bringing up children. The better education, abundant creative facilities, and diverse experiences that urban areas offer can significantly contribute to a child's development and set them up for success in life.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";The workforce of today is comprised of diverse occupations, with various sectors contributing to the functioning of society. Among these, there are jobs provided by government-related companies and private companies, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Despite the benefits and drawbacks associated with working for either type of company, my personal preference is to be my own boss and establish my own business.On one hand, government-related companies offer job security, stability, and a sense of pride in serving the public. These companies often provide a fixed schedule, benefits, and a clear path for career advancement. However, the bureaucratic nature of government institutions can lead to slow decision-making processes, limited innovation, and a lack of autonomy for employees.On the other hand, private companies offer a dynamic work environment, opportunities for innovation and creativity, and the potential for higher salaries. Private companies often have a more agile decision-making process, allowing for quicker adaptation to changing market conditions. Nevertheless, private companies can be unpredictable, with job security often tied to the company's performance, and employees may face long working hours and high stress levels.While both types of companies have their pros and cons, I believe that having my own business would be the most fulfilling and rewarding experience. As an entrepreneur, I would have the freedom to pursue my passions, make my own decisions, and reap the benefits of my hard work. I would be able to create a work-life balance that suits me, and have the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.Furthermore, being my own boss would allow me to innovate, take risks, and bring new ideas to the market. I would have the autonomy to create a work environment that values creativity, teamwork, and employee satisfaction. While starting a business can be challenging, the potential rewards and sense of accomplishment make it an attractive option for me.In conclusion, while government-related and private companies have their advantages and disadvantages, my personal preference is to work for myself and establish my own business. I believe that being an entrepreneur would provide me with the autonomy, creativity, and fulfillment that I desire in a career.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"The concept of failure has long been a part of the human experience. Throughout our lives, many of us will face at least one setback in areas such as education, love, and economics. While some may argue that the best way to deal with failure is to forget it and move on, I firmly believe that people should not give up when faced with failure.First and foremost, failure is an inherent part of the learning process. Every successful person has experienced failure at some point in their lives, but it is how they respond to it that matters. When we fail, we are given the opportunity to reflect on our mistakes, identify areas for improvement, and try again with renewed knowledge and determination. By persevering through failure, we develop resilience, a crucial trait for achieving success in the long run.Furthermore, giving up on failure can lead to missed opportunities and regret. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" His persistence and determination eventually led to a groundbreaking invention that changed the world. Similarly, J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, was a single mother living on welfare when her book was rejected by numerous publishers. Instead of giving up, she continued to write and eventually became one of the most successful authors in the world.Moreover, failure can also serve as a catalyst for growth and innovation. When we are forced to think outside the box and come up with alternative solutions, we can stumble upon novel ideas and approaches that we may not have considered otherwise. For instance, the failure of the Sony Betamax led to the development of the more successful VHS format, while the failure of the Apple Newton led to the creation of the revolutionary iPhone.In conclusion, failure is an inevitable part of life, but it is how we respond to it that truly matters. Instead of giving up, we should use failure as an opportunity to learn, grow, and innovate. By persevering through failure, we can develop the resilience and determination needed to achieve success in the long run."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;The debate about the importance of endangered animals versus human needs has been a longstanding one. While it is undeniable that endangered animals play a vital role in maintaining the balance of our ecosystem, it is equally important to consider the needs of the growing human population.First and foremost, the world's population is increasing at an exponential rate. This surge in population has led to a corresponding increase in the demand for food. In order to meet this demand, large tracts of land are being converted into agricultural fields, which often encroach upon the natural habitats of endangered animals. While it is crucial to protect these habitats, it is equally important to ensure that the basic needs of humans are met.Furthermore, the need for shelter is another fundamental human requirement. As the population grows, so does the need for land to build houses and other infrastructure. This often leads to the destruction of natural habitats, but it is essential to provide people with a safe and secure place to live.Lastly, the growth of industries is crucial for providing humans with the basic necessities of life, such as clothing, healthcare, and other comforts. While these industries often have a negative impact on the environment and contribute to the decline of endangered species, they are essential for meeting the needs of the growing population.In conclusion, while endangered animals are important, human needs should take precedence. The growing population's need for food, shelter, and other basic necessities cannot be ignored. It is essential to find a balance between protecting endangered species and meeting the needs of humans. By doing so, we can ensure the survival of both humans and animals, and create a sustainable future for generations to come.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";In today's society, individuals possess two distinct features that contribute to their overall identity: appearance and personality. Appearance refers to the physical characteristics that make up an individual's external image, such as their facial structure, body shape, and style. On the other hand, personality encompasses the unique traits, behaviors, and attitudes that define a person's inner self. While both features play a significant role in shaping who we are, I firmly believe that personality is the most important aspect of an individual.Appearance is undoubtedly crucial in making a first impression. It can convey confidence, elegance, or friendliness, and can often influence how others perceive us. However, appearance is superficial and can be deceiving. A person may look beautiful on the outside, but be ugly on the inside. Conversely, someone may appear plain or unremarkable, yet possess a heart of gold. Personality, on the other hand, is what truly sets us apart. It is the culmination of our values, passions, and experiences that make us who we are. A person's personality can light up a room, make us laugh, or offer a listening ear when we need it most.Moreover, personality is what endures over time. While appearance may fade or change, our personality remains a constant part of us. It is what draws people to us, forms lasting relationships, and leaves a lasting impact on those around us. In contrast, appearance is fleeting and can be easily manipulated. A person can change their appearance to fit in or impress others, but their personality is a fundamental part of their being.In conclusion, while appearance may play a significant role in our lives, it is personality that truly makes us who we are. It is the foundation upon which we build our relationships, our careers, and our legacies. As we navigate life, it is essential to remember that it is not what we look like that defines us, but rather who we are on the inside that truly matters.
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;Title: The Double-Edged Sword of a Universal Language: Balancing Economic Cooperation and Cultural PreservationIn today's interconnected world, a single international language plays a pivotal role in facilitating global economic cooperation. A universal language, such as English, has become the lingua franca of international business, allowing people from diverse linguistic backgrounds to communicate effectively and conduct trade seamlessly. The use of a single language has streamlined international transactions, boosted economic growth, and fostered global collaboration. It has also enabled the free flow of ideas, cultures, and innovations across borders, enriching the global cultural landscape.On the other hand, the dominance of a universal language poses a threat to the preservation of individual cultural heritages. Every country has its unique linguistic and cultural identity, which is deeply rooted in its history, traditions, and values. The increasing reliance on a single international language may lead to the marginalization of native languages and cultures, as people may prioritize the use of the dominant language over their own. This could result in the loss of cultural diversity, as local languages and customs are replaced by a homogeneous global culture.To mitigate this risk, it is essential for countries to strike a balance between embracing a universal language for economic cooperation and preserving their cultural heritage. Governments, educational institutions, and cultural organizations should promote the teaching and use of native languages, while also providing opportunities for people to learn and use the universal language. By doing so, nations can reap the benefits of global economic cooperation while safeguarding their cultural identities. Ultimately, the coexistence of a universal language and diverse cultural heritages is not only possible but also necessary for a rich, inclusive, and prosperous global community.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;The debate on whether personal style or fashion trends should be prioritized has been a longstanding one. While some individuals believe that dressing in a personal style should be advocated, I firmly stand by the opinion that fashion trends play a more vital role in people's lives. The primary reason for this stance is that following fashion trends enables individuals to stay abreast of the world's latest transformations.Fashion trends are a reflection of the times we live in, and they often embody the cultural, social, and economic shifts that are taking place globally. By following these trends, individuals can stay connected to the pulse of the world, ensuring they are aware of the latest developments and advancements. This is particularly important in today's fast-paced, ever-evolving society, where being informed and adaptable is crucial for personal and professional growth.In contrast, personal dressing styles, while allowing for self-expression and individuality, can sometimes lead to isolation from the broader cultural context. By prioritizing personal style over fashion trends, individuals may inadvertently disconnect themselves from the world around them, missing out on the opportunity to engage with and contribute to the evolving cultural landscape.Moreover, fashion trends often drive innovation and creativity, pushing the boundaries of style and aesthetics. By embracing these trends, individuals can participate in this creative process, experimenting with new looks and ideas, and even influencing the direction of future trends. This dynamic interplay between trend-following and innovation is essential for the progression of fashion and, by extension, culture as a whole.In conclusion, while personal style is undoubtedly important for self-expression and individuality, I firmly believe that fashion trends play a more essential role in people's lives. By following these trends, individuals can stay connected to the world's latest transformations, drive innovation, and participate in the evolving cultural landscape.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";The vast economic disparities between wealthy and impoverished nations have long been a contentious issue. In recent years, however, it has become increasingly clear that the rich have a moral obligation to share their wealth with those struggling to survive. Not only is it inhumane to stand idly by while fellow human beings struggle against famine and poverty, but it also makes economic sense.The plight of those living in poverty is a stark reminder of the gross inequalities that exist in our world. Famine, malnutrition, and disease are just a few of the many hardships faced by those living in abject poverty. It is inhumane to watch one's fellow man struggle against such adversity, and it is our collective responsibility to act. By providing aid to those in need, wealthy nations can help alleviate the suffering of millions, and in doing so, promote a more just and equitable world.Economically speaking, providing aid to impoverished nations can also create a win-win situation. By investing in the development of these nations, wealthy countries can help create new markets, stimulate economic growth, and increase trade opportunities. This, in turn, can lead to increased economic stability and security for all nations involved. Furthermore, a more prosperous and stable global economy can also help reduce the likelihood of conflict and promote peace.In conclusion, it is not only a moral imperative that wealthy nations share their fortune with the poor, but it also makes economic sense. By providing aid to those in need, we can help create a more just and equitable world, promote economic growth and stability, and ultimately, benefit ourselves. It is our collective responsibility to act, and we must do so with urgency and compassion.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;The Importance of Health Education for Future GenerationsHealth education is a vital component of a well-rounded education, and its benefits extend far beyond the classroom. By incorporating health education into our curriculum, we can have a long-term positive impact on future generations. This type of education equips individuals with the necessary knowledge to protect themselves from the risks of diseases, empowering them to make informed decisions about their health.One of the primary advantages of health education is that it enables people to take preventative measures to maintain good health. By understanding the risks associated with various diseases, individuals can adopt healthy habits and behaviors that reduce their likelihood of developing chronic conditions. This, in turn, contributes to an overall improvement in the general health state of all citizens. A population that is educated about healthy living is more likely to prioritize wellness, leading to a reduction in the prevalence of preventable diseases.Moreover, health education can have a significant economic impact. The cost of treatment for chronic diseases is often much higher than the cost of prevention. By educating people on healthy habits and disease prevention, we can reduce the financial burden on healthcare systems. This, in turn, can lead to a more efficient allocation of resources, allowing for a greater focus on other important areas of healthcare.In conclusion, health education is essential for preparing future generations for a lifetime of healthy living. By providing individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect themselves from disease, we can create a healthier, more informed population. As a society, it is our responsibility to prioritize health education, ensuring that our children and grandchildren are equipped to make informed decisions about their health and wellbeing. By doing so, we can create a brighter, healthier future for generations to come.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;The advent of 24-hour news media has sparked intense debate regarding its impact on society. While many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits, it is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people's knowledge.On the one hand, critics argue that the proliferation of news media has led to a culture of sensationalism and superficial reporting. The constant stream of information can be overwhelming, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis and nuance. Furthermore, the emphasis on ratings and viewer numbers can result in biased reporting, where the focus is on attracting a large audience rather than providing accurate and balanced news.On the other hand, proponents of 24-hour news media argue that it has made a significant contribution to people's knowledge and understanding of current events. News channels provide a platform for experts and journalists to share their insights and analysis, thereby enriching people's understanding of complex issues. Moreover, the vast array of news sources available has enabled people to access a wide range of perspectives and opinions, fostering a more informed and discerning public.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the drawbacks of 24-hour news media, it is reasonable to suggest that this is a positive development. The benefits of increased access to information and diverse perspectives outweigh the drawbacks, and news media continues to play a vital role in shaping public discourse and opinion. Ultimately, a balanced and informed approach to consuming news media is necessary to reap its benefits and navigate its pitfalls.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;The world of sports has long been recognized as a powerful tool for fostering international unity and promoting national pride. International sporting occasions, such as the FIFA World Cup, have a profound impact on reducing tensions and strengthening bonds among nations. These events embody the spirit of healthiness, honesty, and fairness, creating a platform for countries to come together and celebrate the universal language of sports.The FIFA World Cup, for instance, brings together athletes and spectators from diverse cultural backgrounds, showcasing their skills, strategies, and teamwork. As nations compete against each other, a sense of national pride and patriotism is ignited, with fans enthusiastically cheering on their teams. This shared experience creates a common ground for people to connect, promoting mutual respect and understanding.Moreover, sporting occasions like the World Cup encourage friendship and solidarity among nations. The Olympic Games, for example, have a long history of promoting peaceful coexistence among participating countries. The Olympic Truce, a tradition dating back to ancient Greece, calls for a cessation of hostilities during the Games, highlighting the power of sports to transcend political differences.Sporting events also play a crucial role in promoting national identity and pride. Athletes, as ambassadors of their countries, embody the values and spirit of their nations. Their achievements on the field inspire a sense of national pride, as fans celebrate their victories and mourn their defeats together. This collective experience strengthens national bonds, fostering a sense of community and shared identity.In conclusion, international sporting occasions like the World Cup offer a unique platform for nations to come together, promote national pride, and strengthen understanding. By embodying the values of healthiness, honesty, and fairness, sports events have the power to reduce international tensions and promote peaceful coexistence. As the world continues to navigate complex geopolitical relationships, the role of sports in promoting global unity and understanding cannot be overstated.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;The issue of educating children from a young age to be independent and responsible for their actions is a topic of debate among educators, policymakers, and parents. In many countries, children are encouraged to engage in paid work or entrepreneurial activities to promote independence and responsibility. However, some people argue that this approach is not an effective educational measure. From my perspective, I firmly believe that the benefits of children's engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.On the one hand, engaging children in paid work can teach them valuable skills such as time management, budgeting, and accountability. For instance, a child who starts a small business, like dog walking or lawn mowing, learns to manage their time effectively, prioritize tasks, and take responsibility for their actions. These skills are essential for success in all areas of life, including academics, career, and personal relationships. Moreover, earning their own money instills a sense of pride and self-worth, motivating them to work harder and strive for excellence.On the other hand, some people argue that engaging children in paid work can distract them from their studies, lead to exploitation, or create undue stress. While these concerns are valid, I believe that with proper guidance and supervision, children can navigate these challenges and reap the benefits of paid work. For example, parents or educators can help children set boundaries between work and study, ensure they are paid fairly, and provide emotional support when needed.Furthermore, paid work can also help children develop a strong work ethic, which is essential for achieving their goals and pursuing their passions. By experiencing the value of hard work and dedication, children can develop a growth mindset, resilience, and a sense of purpose. These traits are crucial for overcoming obstacles, adapting to change, and succeeding in an increasingly competitive and fast-paced world.In conclusion, while some people may argue that engaging children in paid work is not an effective educational measure, I firmly believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. By teaching children valuable skills, promoting independence, and fostering a strong work ethic, paid work can set them up for success in all areas of life. As educators and policymakers, we should encourage and support children's engagement in paid work, while providing guidance and supervision to ensure their well-being and success.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;The decision to take a break before commencing university studies has become an increasingly popular trend amongst students. This break, often referred to as a gap year, allows students to take a pause from academics and focus on personal development. Many students use this opportunity to travel around the world, exploring new cultures and meeting people from diverse backgrounds. Others opt to take up a job, gaining valuable work experience and skills.The experience gained through traveling and working during this break can have a profound impact on a student's personal and professional growth. Traveling exposes students to different ways of life, forcing them to adapt to new situations and challenges. This helps build confidence, as students learn to navigate unfamiliar environments and interact with people from different walks of life. Meeting new people and forming connections also broadens their perspectives, fostering empathy and understanding.Similarly, taking up a job during the gap year provides students with a chance to develop essential skills such as time management, teamwork, and problem-solving. Working in a real-world setting also helps students understand the value of hard work and responsibility, as they learn to balance their job with other aspects of their life. Moreover, earning their own money and managing their finances teaches them the importance of budgeting and saving.The independence gained through this experience is perhaps the most significant benefit of taking a break before university. Students learn to rely on themselves, making decisions and taking charge of their lives. This newfound independence also translates to their academic pursuits, as they approach university with a renewed sense of purpose and motivation. Ultimately, the gap year experience can be a transformative period in a student's life, laying the foundation for future success and personal growth.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;In today's fast-paced and competitive world, it is often emphasized that acquiring vast knowledge and skills is crucial to achieving success and standing out from the crowd. While I partially concur with this notion, I also believe that it is possible to shine and thrive without the need for a university education. This is particularly evident in fields such as entertainment and sports, where success is often determined by innate talent, dedication, and hard work rather than academic credentials.Indeed, numerous examples of successful individuals in these sectors can be cited, who have risen to prominence without the benefit of a university degree. Musicians, actors, and artists, for instance, often rely on their natural ability and perseverance to hone their craft and gain recognition. Similarly, athletes and sports personalities may have learned their skills through rigorous training and practice, rather than through formal education.Moreover, the route to success in these fields is often characterized by a more practical, hands-on approach, where experience and networking play a significant role. The entertainment and sports industries are built on talent, passion, and a strong work ethic, rather than solely on academic qualifications. This is not to say that knowledge and skills are not essential, but rather that they can be acquired through alternative means, such as vocational training, apprenticeships, or self-directed learning.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of knowledge and skills in achieving success, I also believe that there are alternative paths to shining and thriving in certain sectors. The examples of entertainment and sports serve as a reminder that success is not solely dependent on academic credentials, but also on innate talent, dedication, and hard work. By recognizing and valuing these alternative routes, we can provide more inclusive and diverse opportunities for individuals to excel and reach their full potential.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";The rise of digital technology has revolutionized the way we access and engage with art and historical objects. With just a few clicks, we can now browse through vast collections of artworks and historical artifacts from the comfort of our own homes. However, despite the convenience offered by online platforms, public museums and art galleries will continue to play a vital role in our society.While it is true that most people nowadays prefer to use the internet to search for artworks, as it brings them convenience and saves time, online platforms cannot replace the physical experience of visiting a museum or art gallery. Pictures online are limited to a screen size, and no matter how high the resolution, they cannot capture the essence and grandeur of the real thing. When we visit a museum or art gallery, we are not just looking at objects, we are experiencing them in a more intimate and personal way. We can see the textures, the colors, and the details that make each piece unique.Moreover, museums and art galleries offer a spiritual experience that online platforms cannot match. Standing in front of a masterpiece, surrounded by the atmosphere of a gallery, we can feel the emotions and intentions of the artist. We can connect with the artwork on a deeper level, and gain a more profound understanding of its significance. In contrast, online images can feel sterile and disconnected from their context.Furthermore, museums and art galleries are not just about displaying artworks, they are also about preserving our cultural heritage and providing a space for education, research, and community engagement. They offer guided tours, workshops, and lectures that enrich our understanding of the artworks and their historical context. They also provide a space for people to come together, share their experiences, and discuss their perspectives.In conclusion, while online platforms have made it easier for us to access artworks and historical objects, they cannot replace the physical experience of visiting a museum or art gallery. Public museums and art galleries will continue to play a vital role in our society, providing a space for spiritual experience, education, and community engagement.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;The use of prior convictions in court proceedings has been a topic of debate in many countries. In most jurisdictions, the jury is provided with the defendant's criminal history, which is intended to inform their decision-making process. However, there are exceptions to this practice, notably in the United Kingdom and Australia, where the jury is not privy to this information. This raises an interesting question: should the jury be aware of a defendant's past behavior when deciding their fate?On one hand, many people hold the opinion that past behavior is a strong indicator of future actions. This notion is rooted in the idea that an individual's tendencies and patterns of behavior are likely to repeat themselves. Providing the jury with the defendant's criminal history may seem like a necessary tool to help them understand the likelihood of the defendant committing a similar crime in the future. However, this approach has its drawbacks.In order for the jury to come up with an objective decision, it is essential that they are not swayed by irrelevant information. Providing the jury with a defendant's entire criminal history can lead to prejudice and bias. The jury may be tempted to judge the defendant based on their past actions rather than the specific case at hand. This can lead to unfair outcomes and undermine the integrity of the justice system.Instead, the court should only provide the jury with details relevant to the particular case. This approach ensures that the jury is not influenced by extraneous information and can focus on the specific circumstances of the case. By doing so, the jury can make a more objective decision, untainted by the defendant's past behavior.In conclusion, while the idea that past behavior determines future actions may hold some merit, it is essential that the jury is only provided with information relevant to the case at hand. This approach ensures that justice is served and the defendant receives a fair trial. The exceptions to this practice, as seen in the UK and Australia, highlight the importance of protecting the integrity of the justice system and promoting fair decision-making.
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;The Impact of the Internet on Schooling: A Double-Edged SwordThe integration of the Internet into the education system has sparked a heated debate among educationists, with some hailing it as a revolutionary tool, while others warning of its potential drawbacks. As we move forward, it is likely that the Internet will become an indispensable part of academic training, bringing about numerous benefits that enhance the learning experience. However, critics argue that the Internet also has several negative consequences that can affect the education system adversely.On the one hand, the Internet has the potential to transform the way we learn. It provides unparalleled access to information, enabling students to explore a vast array of subjects and topics at their own pace. Online resources, such as educational websites, e-books, and virtual libraries, offer a wealth of knowledge that was previously inaccessible. Moreover, the Internet facilitates collaboration and communication among students, teachers, and peers, promoting a more interactive and engaging learning environment. The Internet also enables the use of multimedia tools, such as videos, podcasts, and interactive simulations, which can make complex concepts more engaging and easier to understand.On the other hand, critics argue that the Internet can also have negative consequences on the education system. For instance, the ease of access to information can lead to a lack of critical thinking and analysis, as students may rely too heavily on online sources rather than developing their own research skills. Moreover, the Internet can be a distraction, with social media and online games competing for students' attention, leading to a decrease in productivity and academic performance. Furthermore, the Internet can also perpetuate inequality, as not all students have equal access to the Internet, creating a digital divide that can exacerbate existing disparities in education.In conclusion, the impact of the Internet on schooling is a complex issue with both benefits and drawbacks. While the Internet has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn, it also poses significant challenges. As we move forward, it is essential to address these challenges and ensure that the Internet is harnessed in a way that promotes effective learning, critical thinking, and equal access to education.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;The world is faced with a pressing issue, where a significant number of patients in impoverished countries are succumbing to deaths not due to the severity of their illnesses, but rather the unavailability of life-saving medications. This heartbreaking reality has sparked a heated debate, with many arguing that pharmaceutical companies in developed nations have a moral obligation to reduce the prices of their medicines, thereby making them more accessible to those in dire need.Proponents of this argument contend that the current prices of medications are exorbitant and exploitative, resulting in the unnecessary loss of countless lives. They assert that companies in developed countries have a responsibility to prioritize human life over profits, and that reducing the prices of medicines would be a crucial step in this direction.However, a closer examination of the issue reveals that the current cost of medicines is, in fact, reasonable and based on their effectiveness. The development of medicines is a complex and costly process, involving years of research, testing, and regulatory approvals. Pharmaceutical companies invest significant resources into the creation of these life-saving treatments, and their prices reflect the value they bring to patients and society as a whole.Furthermore, reducing the prices of medicines could have unintended consequences, such as reducing the incentive for companies to invest in research and development, ultimately hindering the discovery of new treatments and cures. Rather than simply reducing prices, a more nuanced approach may be necessary, such as exploring alternative models of pricing, or implementing policies that promote equitable access to medicines without compromising the viability of pharmaceutical companies.Ultimately, while the issue of inaccessible medicines is a pressing concern, it is essential to adopt a balanced perspective that takes into account the complex factors at play. By working together, we can find solutions that prioritize both human life and the sustainability of the pharmaceutical industry, ensuring that life-saving medicines are available to those who need them most.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;The Growing Awareness of Smoking's Harmful Effects: A Step Towards a Healthier NationIn recent years, the general public has become increasingly aware of the devastating effects of smoking on one's health. This growing awareness has put significant pressure on both governments and private sectors to take action against this harmful habit. As a result, many businesses have taken a proactive approach by prohibiting smoking within their premises, while some governments have restricted smoking in public areas. This move is a step in the right direction, as it not only improves the quality of health of citizens but also enhances the image of a nation in the long run.The health benefits of restricting smoking in public areas are well-documented. Second-hand smoke, also known as passive smoking, is a proven carcinogen that can cause serious health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory issues. By banning smoking in public areas, governments can significantly reduce the exposure of non-smokers to second-hand smoke, thereby reducing the risk of these health problems. Furthermore, smoking bans have been shown to reduce the number of smokers, as the inconvenience of having to smoke outside or in designated areas can be a deterrent for some.Beyond the health benefits, restricting smoking in public areas also has a positive impact on a nation's image. A smoke-free environment sends a strong message about a country's commitment to public health and wellness. This, in turn, can boost tourism, as visitors are more likely to be attracted to a country that prioritizes the health and well-being of its citizens. Additionally, a smoke-free nation is more likely to attract businesses and investments, as a healthy workforce is a key factor in a country's economic growth.In conclusion, the move to restrict smoking in public areas is a forward-thinking decision that will have far-reaching benefits for a nation's health and image. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of smoking, it is heartening to see governments and private sectors taking proactive steps to address this issue. By working together, we can create a healthier, smoke-free nation that benefits all its citizens.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";"The phrase ""Save the Planet Earth"" has become a ubiquitous slogan, echoing across the globe. This clarion call to action is not merely a cliché, but a dire warning that underscores the imperative need to protect our planet. The concerns to save Earth are multifaceted and far-reaching, with various compelling reasons underscoring the urgency of this endeavor.One of the primary reasons for this concern is the alarming rate of environmental degradation. The large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants, such as air conditioners, have taken a devastating toll on the ozone layer. The depletion of the ozone layer, a crucial shield that protects life on Earth from the harsh ultraviolet rays of the sun, has severe implications for the health of our planet. The consequences of this damage are far-reaching, including increased risk of skin cancer, cataracts, and disruption of ecosystems.Furthermore, the unchecked emission of greenhouse gases has led to a rise in global temperatures, resulting in climate change. This, in turn, has triggered a cascade of catastrophic events, including melting of polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and extreme weather patterns. The repercussions of these events are widespread, impacting not only the environment but also human societies, economies, and politics.In light of these compelling reasons, it is imperative that we take collective action to save the planet. This requires a multifaceted approach, involving governments, corporations, and individuals. We must strive to reduce our carbon footprint, invest in renewable energy sources, and adopt sustainable practices. By doing so, we can mitigate the damage already done and work towards a more sustainable future. The fate of our planet hangs in the balance, and it is our responsibility to ensure that we do everything in our power to save the planet Earth."
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The notion of sacrificing senior members to save younger workers has gained traction in recent years, particularly in the context of organizational restructuring and workforce optimization. However, this approach poses several negative influences that can have far-reaching consequences on individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.On a personal level, this approach fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. Senior members, who have dedicated their careers to the organization, are suddenly forced to retire early, leaving them feeling undervalued and unappreciated. This can lead to feelings of resentment and disillusionment, not only among the affected individuals but also among their peers and younger colleagues who witness the injustice. Furthermore, this approach can create a culture of fear and insecurity, where employees feel that their dedication and loyalty are not recognized or rewarded.Moreover, massively forcing early retirement can be a significant financial burden to the local government. When senior members are forced to retire early, they may not have adequate pension or retirement savings to support themselves, leading to a reliance on government assistance programs. This can put a strain on the local government's resources, particularly in areas with limited financial capacity. Additionally, the loss of experienced and skilled workers can also impact the local economy, as their expertise and knowledge are lost to the community.In conclusion, sacrificing senior members to save younger workers is not a viable solution. Instead, organizations should focus on developing strategies that promote intergenerational collaboration, knowledge transfer, and mutual respect. By valuing the contributions of all employees, regardless of age, organizations can create a more inclusive and productive work environment that benefits everyone. Ultimately, a more equitable and sustainable approach to workforce management is essential to avoid the negative influences of sacrificing senior members and to build a stronger, more resilient community.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;The mass media has become an integral part of our daily lives, providing us with a vast array of information, entertainment, and education. However, the issue of media control has long been a topic of controversy, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. One of the strongest arguments in favour of tighter media control is the need to limit the proliferation of violent and sexual content. The media has a profound impact on our society, and the constant bombardment of explicit material can have a desensitizing effect on viewers, particularly children and adolescents. By imposing stricter controls, governments can help shield vulnerable populations from the harmful effects of such content. Furthermore, television companies often import foreign programmes, which can introduce audiences to new ideas and cultural values that may not align with local norms and customs. This can lead to the homogenization of cultures and the erosion of traditional values. Proponents of media control argue that by regulating the content of these programmes, governments can protect the cultural identity of their nations and promote a more nuanced understanding of the world. On the other hand, opponents of media control argue that such measures can compromise the safety of citizens. Overly restrictive regulations can lead to censorship, stifling free speech and limiting access to information. In extreme cases, this can even enable authoritarian regimes to suppress dissenting voices and maintain control over their populations. Ultimately, the question of media control is a delicate balance between protecting society from harmful content and preserving the fundamental right to freedom of expression. While there are valid arguments on both sides, it is crucial that governments and regulatory bodies engage in open and informed discussions to determine the optimal level of control that safeguards both the well-being of citizens and the integrity of the media.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;The role of citizens in a society is a topic of ongoing debate. While some people believe that paying taxes is the sole responsibility of citizens, others argue that being a member of a society entails a broader range of obligations. In my opinion, the latter perspective is more accurate, as the development of a country requires citizens to take on multiple responsibilities beyond mere tax payment.First and foremost, citizens have a duty to obey the laws imposed by the government. Laws are put in place to maintain social order, protect individual rights, and promote the common good. By adhering to these laws, citizens demonstrate their respect for the rule of law and contribute to the smooth functioning of society. This, in turn, creates a stable environment that fosters economic growth, social cohesion, and political stability.Another crucial responsibility of citizens is to protect the country's culture and history. A nation's cultural heritage is a valuable asset that defines its identity and provides a sense of belonging for its citizens. By preserving and promoting their cultural traditions, citizens help to safeguard their national identity and pass it down to future generations. This can be achieved through various means, such as supporting cultural events, visiting historical sites, and learning about the country's history.Moreover, citizens have a moral obligation to engage in activities that benefit the community. This can include volunteering, participating in local initiatives, and taking care of the environment. By doing so, citizens demonstrate their commitment to the well-being of their fellow citizens and contribute to the overall development of the country.In conclusion, being a citizen involves a wide range of responsibilities that go beyond merely paying taxes. By obeying laws, protecting the country's culture and history, and engaging in community activities, citizens play a vital role in shaping the future of their nation. As responsible citizens, we must recognize and embrace these obligations to create a prosperous, cohesive, and stable society.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;Animal testing has long been a contentious issue, with proponents arguing that it has led to numerous medical breakthroughs, while opponents claim that the costs outweigh the benefits. While it is true that animal testing has contributed to the development of various medical treatments, including cancer and HIV drugs, this does not necessarily justify the continuation of this practice.On one hand, it is undeniable that animal testing has played a crucial role in advancing medical knowledge and developing new treatments. Many lifesaving drugs and therapies have been made possible through animal testing, and it is estimated that millions of human lives have been saved as a result. For instance, cancer and HIV drugs, which have revolutionized the treatment of these diseases, were developed and tested on animals before being approved for human use.On the other hand, there are several compelling reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs of animal testing far outweigh the benefits. The use of animals in research is a costly and resource-intensive process, requiring significant investments of time, money, and personnel. Moreover, the results of animal testing are not always reliable or applicable to humans, which raises questions about the validity and usefulness of the data obtained.Secondly, animals are often kept in unnatural conditions that are detrimental to their welfare. Laboratory animals are frequently subjected to stress, pain, and discomfort, and are often housed in small cages or enclosures that do not meet their physical or behavioral needs. This raises serious ethical concerns about the treatment and exploitation of animals for human benefit.In conclusion, while animal testing has undoubtedly contributed to medical progress, the costs and ethical concerns associated with this practice cannot be ignored. As our understanding of animal sentience and welfare evolves, it is becoming increasingly clear that alternative methods, such as in vitro testing and computer simulations, should be developed and utilized in place of animal testing. By prioritizing animal welfare and exploring alternative research methods, we can work towards a future where medical progress is achieved without compromising animal well-being.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";The role of examinations in education systems worldwide has been a topic of debate among educators, policymakers, and students. While examinations are widely used as a means of measuring learning, many argue that their role should be reconsidered. On one hand, there are clear advantages to exams. One of the primary benefits is that they help ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. This standardized approach allows for an objective assessment of students' knowledge and understanding, reducing the potential for bias and favoritism.Moreover, examinations provide a clear benchmark for students to work towards, motivating them to study and prepare throughout the academic year. The pressure of exams can be a powerful driver of learning, as students strive to achieve good grades and meet the expectations of their teachers, parents, and themselves. Additionally, exams help to identify areas where students may need extra support or review, enabling targeted interventions and remedial teaching.However, critics argue that the emphasis on examinations can have negative consequences. Over-reliance on exams can lead to teaching to the test, where educators focus on drilling students on exam techniques rather than fostering deeper understanding and critical thinking. This can result in a narrow, rote-learning approach, neglecting essential skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration. Furthermore, exams can be a source of significant stress and anxiety for students, particularly those who may not perform well under pressure or have learning difficulties.In conclusion, while examinations have their advantages, it is crucial to reconsider their role in education systems. Rather than relying solely on exams, educators and policymakers should explore alternative assessment methods that promote a more holistic approach to learning, such as project-based evaluations, peer assessments, and competency-based progression. By striking a balance between the benefits of exams and the need for more innovative assessments, we can create a more inclusive, effective, and engaging education system that prepares students for success in the 21st century.
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;The development of poorer nations is a pressing global issue that requires collaborative efforts from richer countries. Three essential factors that can significantly contribute to the growth and prosperity of these nations are health, education, and trade. Richer nations can play a crucial role in supporting these areas, thereby empowering poorer nations to break the cycle of poverty.In the health sector, richer nations can delegate doctors and nurses to provide medical expertise and training to local healthcare professionals. This exchange program can help improve the quality of healthcare services, reduce infant mortality rates, and combat infectious diseases. Additionally, donating funds to build hospitals, clinics, and healthcare infrastructure can expand access to medical care for marginalized communities. For instance, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has made significant contributions to global health initiatives, demonstrating the positive impact of such philanthropy.Education is another critical area where richer nations can make a significant difference. Offering scholarships and loans to qualified students from poorer nations can enable them to pursue higher education and acquire skills that are in demand in the global job market. This can lead to a brain gain, where educated individuals return to their home countries and contribute to their economic development. Furthermore, educational exchanges and partnerships between institutions can facilitate knowledge transfer, curriculum development, and capacity building. The Fulbright Program, for example, has been instrumental in promoting academic exchanges between the United States and over 160 countries.In conclusion, health, education, and trade are essential components of a comprehensive development strategy for poorer nations. Richer nations can contribute to these areas by providing medical expertise, donating funds for healthcare infrastructure, offering scholarships and loans for education, and facilitating trade opportunities. By working together, we can create a more equitable and prosperous world, where all nations have the opportunity to thrive.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;"The Role of Teachers: Beyond the ClassroomWhen we think of teachers, we often associate them with the traditional role of imparting knowledge and guiding students through their academic journey. However, the role of a teacher extends far beyond the confines of the classroom. Teachers are not just educators, but also friends, mentors, and role models who play a vital part in shaping the minds and characters of their students.In today's digital age, it is easy to assume that technology can replace the role of a teacher. With the rise of online learning platforms and artificial intelligence, some may argue that a computer can provide the same level of education as a human teacher. However, this assumption is far from the truth. While a computer can provide information and answer questions, it lacks the emotional intelligence and empathy that a human teacher possesses.A teacher is more than just a dispenser of knowledge; they are a friend, a confidant, and a guide who can provide emotional support and encouragement when needed. They can sense when a student is struggling, not just academically, but also personally, and offer a listening ear and a comforting word. This kind of support is essential for a student's emotional and social development, and is something that a computer can never replicate.Moreover, teachers are role models who inspire and motivate their students to reach their full potential. They embody values such as hard work, perseverance, and kindness, and demonstrate these values in their own behavior and interactions with students. This kind of modeling is crucial for students, who are constantly looking for guidance and direction as they navigate the challenges of growing up.In conclusion, teachers are not just teachers; they are also friends, mentors, and role models who play a vital role in shaping the lives of their students. While technology has its place in education, it can never replace the emotional support, guidance, and inspiration that a human teacher provides."
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;The integration of advanced plant foods and newly developed devices has revolutionized the agricultural sector, significantly reducing the cost of producing farm products. This technological advancement has enabled farmers to increase efficiency, productivity, and profitability. However, this progress comes with a caveat. The increased reliance on high-tech fertilizers and electronic equipment for harvest has raised concerns about the potential threats to individuals' health and well-being, as well as the broader societal impacts.On the one hand, the use of advanced plant foods and devices has transformed the way farming is done. With precision agriculture, farmers can now optimize crop yields, reduce waste, and minimize the environmental footprint of their operations. This has led to a significant decrease in production costs, making farm products more accessible and affordable for consumers. Moreover, the increased efficiency has enabled farmers to focus on other aspects of their business, such as sustainability and animal welfare.On the other hand, the over-reliance on high-tech fertilizers has raised concerns about the potential health impacts on individuals. The excessive use of these fertilizers has been linked to soil degradation, water pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. Moreover, the chemical residues from these fertilizers have been found in food products, posing a risk to human health. Furthermore, the increased reliance on electronic equipment for harvest has led to a loss of traditional farming skills and knowledge, as well as a decline in rural employment opportunities.The societal impacts of this trend are also significant. The increased mechanization of farming has led to a decline in rural communities, as farmers are forced to adapt to a more industrialized and technology-driven approach. This has resulted in the loss of traditional farming practices and the erosion of cultural heritage. Moreover, the concentration of agricultural production in the hands of a few large corporations has led to a decline in food security and sovereignty.In conclusion, while advanced plant foods and devices have significantly reduced the cost of producing farm products, the high-tech fertilizers and electronic equipment pose a potential threat to individuals' health and well-being, as well as the broader societal impacts. It is essential to strike a balance between technological progress and sustainable agriculture, ensuring that the benefits of technology are equitably distributed and do not come at the expense of human health and environmental sustainability.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;The notion that governments should cease funding artists has sparked a heated debate in recent years. While some argue that public money could be better spent elsewhere, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several compelling reasons.First and foremost, art plays a vital role in improving the quality of our lives. It has the power to inspire, educate, and bring people together, fostering a sense of community and social cohesion. By supporting artists, governments can help to promote cultural enrichment and diversity, which in turn can have a positive impact on our mental and emotional well-being. Moreover, art can also serve as a platform for social commentary, allowing artists to address pressing issues and spark meaningful discussions.Another significant reason why governments should continue to fund artists is that art can be a significant driver of tourism. Many cities around the world are famous for their cultural attractions, such as museums, galleries, and public art installations. These attractions not only draw in visitors but also create jobs and stimulate local economies. For instance, cities like Paris and Rome are renowned for their rich artistic heritage, and it is estimated that tourism related to art and culture generates billions of dollars in revenue each year. By supporting artists and investing in cultural infrastructure, governments can help to attract tourists and boost their local economies.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the suggestion that governments should stop funding artists. Art is an essential part of our lives, and by supporting artists, governments can promote cultural enrichment, diversity, and economic growth. Rather than cutting funding, governments should continue to invest in the arts, recognizing the invaluable contribution that artists make to our society.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The debate surrounding the role of technology in saving the environment has sparked intense discussion among experts and individuals alike. On one hand, some people argue that abandoning technology and embracing a simpler way of life is the only way to preserve the planet. They contend that the over-reliance on technology has led to rampant industrialization, pollution, and climate change, which can only be mitigated by adopting a more primitive and sustainable lifestyle.On the other hand, proponents of technology argue that it holds the key to solving the world's environmental problems. They believe that advancements in engineering and technology can provide innovative solutions to the environmental challenges we face today. For instance, renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power, can significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.Furthermore, technologies like carbon capture and storage can mitigate the effects of climate change, while sustainable agriculture and forestry practices can help preserve biodiversity. The integration of technology into our daily lives can also promote sustainable consumption patterns, reduce waste, and optimize resource usage.As we enter an era where engineering and technology are increasingly being harnessed to address environmental concerns, it is clear that technology alone cannot solve the world's environmental problems. However, when combined with a shift in individual and collective behavior, technology can play a vital role in mitigating the environmental impact of human activities.Ultimately, the solution lies in striking a balance between technology and simplicity. By leveraging technology to support sustainable practices and adopting a more mindful approach to consumption, we can work towards a more environmentally conscious future. Rather than pitting technology against simplicity, we should focus on harnessing the power of innovation to create a better world for generations to come.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The debate over the salaries of professional athletes and entertainers has been a contentious issue for quite some time. While some people believe that their multi-million dollar salaries are justified, others argue that their contributions to society do not warrant such excessive pay. On one hand, proponents of high salaries for athletes and entertainers argue that their exceptional abilities set them apart from others and justify their compensation.They claim that these individuals have dedicated their lives to honing their craft and entertaining millions, and that their talents are worth the high price tag. For instance, a skilled athlete like Cristiano Ronaldo or LeBron James has spent countless hours perfecting their game, and their ability to captivate audiences and inspire fans is indeed valuable. Similarly, a talented singer like Beyoncé or Taylor Swift has worked tirelessly to develop her unique sound and connect with her fans on a deep level.On the other hand, critics argue that athletes and entertainers contribute relatively little to the betterment of society compared to other professionals. For example, while a doctor or nurse may save countless lives and improve the well-being of their patients, their salaries are often a fraction of what a professional athlete or singer earns. Similarly, a teacher may spend years educating and inspiring young minds, but their compensation is often meager compared to that of a famous athlete or musician.In conclusion, while athletes and entertainers certainly bring joy and excitement to millions of fans, their contributions to society should be put into perspective.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;"The notion that the internet and computers will eventually replace the traditional role of teachers has gained significant traction in recent years. Proponents of this idea argue that the vast and easily accessible online repository of information makes traditional teaching methods obsolete. With the internet at their fingertips, students can access a wealth of knowledge that was previously only available through teachers. This, they claim, will render teachers redundant, as students will be able to learn and acquire knowledge independently.However, critics of this idea counter that while the internet is undoubtedly a valuable educational tool, it has its limitations. Firstly, the internet is only as good as the information it contains, and with the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online, students require guidance to critically evaluate the sources they encounter. Moreover, the internet lacks the human interaction and socialization that a traditional classroom provides, essential for developing important life skills such as communication, empathy, and teamwork.Furthermore, the internet is not a substitute for the nuanced and personalized guidance that a teacher can offer. Teachers provide more than just information; they offer context, interpretation, and feedback that is tailored to individual students' needs. They also create a supportive and motivating learning environment that fosters students' curiosity and enthusiasm for learning. While the internet can supplement a student's education, it is unlikely to fully replace the complexities of human teaching. Therefore, rather than viewing the internet and computers as a replacement for traditional teaching, we should harness their potential to augment and enhance the educational experience."
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";"The death penalty has been a contentious issue in many countries, with proponents arguing that it serves as a deterrent to brutal crimes, while opponents contend that it is a violation of human rights. On one hand, the death penalty can be seen as an effective retribution to admonish violence and maintain social order. In a world where heinous crimes are prevalent, the threat of capital punishment may instill fear in potential offenders, thus reducing the incidence of such crimes. For instance, in some jurisdictions, the death penalty is reserved for crimes such as murder, treason, and terrorism, which are considered to be of the utmost severity. The logic behind this approach is that by imposing the ultimate penalty, society can protect itself from those who pose a significant threat to its safety and well-being. Moreover, the death penalty can be seen as a means of achieving justice for victims and their families, providing closure and a sense of vindication. On the other hand, as society progresses and human rights become more respected, the idea of ""murdering"" criminals becomes increasingly difficult to accept. The death penalty raises concerns about the sanctity of human life, and whether the state has the right to take it away. Moreover, there is always a risk of executing an innocent person, which would be a gross miscarriage of justice. Additionally, many argue that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent, as many crimes are committed in the heat of the moment, without consideration for the consequences. In conclusion, while the death penalty may be seen as a necessary evil in certain circumstances, its use is a complex issue that raises important ethical and moral questions. As society continues to evolve, it is likely that the debate surrounding capital punishment will persist, with no clear-cut solution in sight."
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;The establishment of companies, factories, and businesses is primarily driven by the need to provide products that cater to the demands of the masses, while also generating profits for their managers. This fundamental objective is essential for the growth and sustainability of any economy. However, if left unchecked, these businesses can pose significant threats to the very fabric of our existence, including human life, animal welfare, and plant survival.The absence of regulatory measures and oversight can lead to a scenario where businesses prioritize profits over environmental and social responsibilities. This can result in the production of low-quality products, which not only compromise consumer safety but also perpetuate a culture of disposability, contributing to environmental degradation. Furthermore, the unchecked pursuit of profit can lead to exorbitant pricing, making essential products inaccessible to marginalized communities, thereby exacerbating social inequalities.The environmental impact of unregulated businesses is equally alarming. The unbridled exploitation of natural resources can lead to deforestation, pollution, and climate change, which have far-reaching consequences for human health, biodiversity, and ecosystem balance. The well-being of animals is also compromised, as they are often subjected to inhumane treatment and habitats destruction in the name of profit.It is, therefore, imperative that governments and regulatory bodies establish and enforce stringent guidelines to ensure that businesses operate within the bounds of social and environmental responsibility. This can include measures such as regular audits, environmental impact assessments, and consumer protection laws. By implementing these controls, we can strike a balance between economic growth and the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants. Ultimately, the future of our planet depends on our ability to harness the benefits of business while mitigating its negative consequences.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;The current high school in our district has been serving students for many years, but unfortunately, it has become outdated and lacks the necessary facilities and resources to provide students with a quality education. The school's infrastructure is in dire need of renovation, and the lack of modern amenities hinders the students' ability to reach their full potential.In contrast, the new high school that is being built promises to be a game-changer for our community. Not only will it provide a state-of-the-art learning environment, but it will also serve as a hub for students from different communities and districts across the city to come together and connect.The new school's design and layout are specifically intended to foster a sense of community and collaboration among students from diverse backgrounds. The school will feature modern classrooms, cutting-edge technology, and ample space for extracurricular activities, allowing students to engage with one another and develop valuable relationships.Moreover, the new high school will provide opportunities for students to interact with peers from different neighborhoods and socioeconomic backgrounds, promoting cross-cultural understanding and empathy. This will be particularly beneficial for students who may not have had the chance to interact with people from different walks of life otherwise.As a result, the new high school will not only provide a better learning environment but also play a vital role in shaping the city's future by bringing together young people from various communities. It will be a place where students can learn from each other, share ideas, and develop a sense of social responsibility.In conclusion, the new high school will be a beacon of hope for our community, offering a fresh start and a chance for students to thrive in a modern and inclusive environment.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;The Adolescent Years: A Critical Period of Growth and DevelopmentAdolescence is a transformative period in a person's life, marked by significant physical, emotional, and psychological changes. Teenagers, in particular, require more attention and guidance during this phase, as they navigate the challenges of growing up. While older adults, such as parents and relatives, may have accumulated more life experience, they are uniquely positioned to provide valuable advice and support to their teenage children.Experienced adults, having lived through various life experiences, possess a deeper understanding of the world and its complexities. Their maturity and wisdom enable them to offer sage advice, helping teenagers make informed decisions and avoid common pitfalls. Moreover, their life experience has equipped them with the skills to identify potential problems and provide effective solutions, thereby protecting their children from harm. For instance, parents can caution their teenage children about the dangers of substance abuse, peer pressure, and other negative influences, helping them develop healthy habits and a positive outlook on life.Furthermore, seeking advice from experienced adults can save teenagers valuable resources, such as time and money. By learning from others' mistakes, teenagers can avoid costly errors and focus on their goals and aspirations. For example, a parent's guidance can help a teenager choose a suitable career path, saving them from the financial burden of changing careers later in life. Similarly, advice from a relative can prevent a teenager from wasting time on unproductive pursuits, allowing them to prioritize their time and energy on more rewarding activities.In conclusion, teenagers need more attention and help than older adults, and experienced adults, such as parents and relatives, are best positioned to provide this support. Their life experience, wisdom, and guidance can help teenagers navigate the challenges of adolescence, avoid common pitfalls, and make informed decisions. By seeking advice from experienced adults, teenagers can save valuable resources, such as time and money, and set themselves up for success in life.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;Childhood is a stage of life that many people look back on with fondness and nostalgia. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people's lives, and for good reason. There are two main areas in which children's happiness is particularly evident: freedom and a lack of responsibilities.In the first place, children are free to do whatever they want, without the burden of restrictions and limitations that come with adulthood. They can play, explore, and learn without the weight of expectations and responsibilities that adults often face. Children's imaginations are free to roam, and their creativity and curiosity are encouraged and nurtured. They can spend hours playing outside, reading books, or engaging in activities that bring them joy, without worrying about the pressures of daily life.In addition, children are not burdened with the responsibilities of education and work. They do not have to worry about meeting deadlines, paying bills, or managing a career. This freedom from responsibility means that children have a lot of time on their hands to enjoy this stage of their life. They can focus on developing their interests, building relationships with friends and family, and simply enjoying the moment. Without the stresses of adulthood, children are able to live in the present and appreciate the simple things in life.Overall, childhood is a time of freedom, creativity, and joy. Children are able to live life without the burdens and responsibilities that come with growing up. As adults, we can learn from the carefree nature of childhood and strive to recapture some of that joy and freedom in our own lives.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;The university is often regarded as an ideal place for individuals to develop their understanding and expand their knowledge in various fields. One of the primary functions of a university is to prepare students for their future careers. While academics play a crucial role in this process, they are not the only aspect of university life that contributes to career preparation.In addition to completing homework, assignments, and attending classes, students are encouraged to participate in volunteer work and internships to gain practical experience and skills relevant to their chosen profession. Volunteer work, for instance, allows students to develop valuable soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, which are highly valued by employers. It also provides students with the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world settings, thereby deepening their understanding of the subject matter.Internships, on the other hand, offer students a chance to work in a professional environment, network with industry experts, and gain hands-on experience in their field of study. This not only enhances their resume but also equips them with the skills and confidence needed to excel in their chosen career. Furthermore, internships often lead to job opportunities, as employers seek to recruit talented and skilled individuals who have already demonstrated their capabilities in a professional setting.In conclusion, while academics are a vital part of university life, they are not the only factor in preparing students for their careers. Participation in volunteer work and internships is essential for students to develop the practical skills, experience, and networking opportunities that are necessary to succeed in their chosen profession. By combining academic study with real-world experience, universities provide students with a comprehensive education that prepares them for a successful and fulfilling career.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;The Debate on Close Friends vs. Casual AcquaintancesIn the realm of interpersonal relationships, a long-standing debate has been sparked regarding the value of having a large number of casual acquaintances versus a smaller, more intimate circle of close friends. While some may argue that having a vast network of acquaintances is beneficial, I firmly believe that having one or two close friends is far more valuable than having a large casual acquaintance.At its core, a friend is someone you genuinely care about – someone with whom you share a deep emotional connection, trust, and mutual support. Close friends are those who know you inside and out, with whom you can be your authentic self, and who will stand by you through thick and thin. In contrast, casual acquaintances are often superficial relationships that lack substance and depth. They may provide fleeting moments of social interaction, but they rarely offer the same level of emotional intimacy and support that close friends do.Having a large number of casual acquaintances may provide a sense of social validation or a feeling of being connected, but it can also lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection. When we spread ourselves too thin, trying to maintain a large network of acquaintances, we may find ourselves without anyone to turn to in times of need. On the other hand, having one or two close friends provides a sense of security and stability, knowing that there are people who truly care about us and will be there to support us through life's ups and downs.In conclusion, while having a large number of casual acquaintances may have its advantages, I firmly believe that having one or two close friends is far more valuable. Close friends provide a sense of emotional intimacy, trust, and support that is essential to our well-being and happiness. In a world where social media often prioritizes quantity over quality, it is refreshing to focus on nurturing meaningful relationships that bring joy and fulfillment to our lives.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";The world has undergone significant transformations over the past half century. In my opinion, life in the old days brought more happiness to people than it does today. There are several reasons that support this notion.Firstly, life was much simpler in the past. People had fewer material possessions and lived a more modest life. They relied on each other and the community for support, which fostered a sense of belonging and togetherness. In contrast, today's fast-paced world is driven by consumerism and technology, leading to a sense of isolation and disconnection.Secondly, the environment has suffered greatly over the past few decades. Pollution, climate change, and deforestation have all taken a devastating toll on our planet. This has not only harmed the environment but also affected human health and well-being. In the past, people lived in harmony with nature, and the air and water were cleaner. This healthier environment contributed to overall happiness and well-being.Thirdly, the pace of life has changed dramatically. In the past, people lived at a slower pace, with more time for leisure and enjoyment. Today, people are constantly connected to their devices, and their lives are dominated by the demands of work and technology. This fast-paced lifestyle has led to increased stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact mental health and happiness.In conclusion, life in the old days was indeed simpler, more environmentally friendly, and less stressful. These factors all contributed to a greater sense of happiness and well-being.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;High school is often considered a pivotal period in a student's life, as it lays the groundwork for their future academic and professional pursuits. During this time, students are faced with the daunting task of deciding on a career path and field of study that will shape their destiny. In my opinion, high school should allow students to choose the courses they want to take, and I firmly believe that this approach has numerous benefits.First and foremost, permitting students to choose their courses grants them the freedom of choice. By allowing students to select the subjects that genuinely interest them, high school can foster a sense of autonomy and agency. This, in turn, can lead to a more engaged and motivated student body, as individuals are more likely to be invested in their learning when they have a say in what they study. Furthermore, this freedom of choice enables students to explore various fields and disciplines, which can help them discover their passions and aptitudes.Another significant advantage of allowing students to choose their courses is the potential for progress in their grades and knowledge. When students are interested in the subjects they are studying, they are more likely to be motivated to learn and excel. This, in turn, can lead to improved academic performance, as students are more inclined to put in the effort required to succeed in subjects that genuinely interest them.Lastly, allowing students to choose their courses can help them explore their aptitude and identify areas where they excel. By providing students with the opportunity to explore various subjects, high school can help individuals discover their strengths and weaknesses, which can inform their future academic and career choices. This can be particularly beneficial for students who may not have a clear idea of what they want to pursue after high school, as it provides them with a chance to experiment and find their niche.In conclusion, permitting high school students to choose their courses is essential for their academic and personal growth. By granting students the freedom of choice, progress in their grades and knowledge, and the opportunity to explore their aptitude, high school can set students up for success in their future endeavors.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";The age-old debate about the pace at which one completes their tasks has been a subject of interest for many. On one hand, some individuals are perpetually in a rush to finish their work, while on the other hand, there are those who prefer to take their time. After careful consideration, I have developed my own perspective on this matter.In my opinion, the primary reason for completing tasks in a timely manner is to save time for more important and pressing tasks. In today's fast-paced world, time is a precious commodity, and every minute counts. By completing tasks efficiently, individuals can allocate their time more effectively, allowing them to tackle more critical tasks and responsibilities. This, in turn, enables them to achieve a better work-life balance and reduces the likelihood of stress and burnout.Another crucial aspect of maintaining a high pace is that it prevents laziness from setting in. When individuals work at a rapid pace, they are more likely to stay focused and motivated, which helps to build momentum and maintain productivity. Conversely, when tasks are dragged out, it can lead to procrastination and a lack of enthusiasm, ultimately resulting in subpar work quality. Furthermore, working at a high pace helps to build discipline and time management skills, which are essential for achieving success in both personal and professional spheres.In conclusion, completing tasks in a timely manner is essential for achieving success and maintaining productivity. By saving time for important tasks and preventing laziness from setting in, individuals can optimize their work output and achieve a better balance between work and personal life.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;Tourism is a powerful engine for economic growth and development in various states and regions around the world. By attracting visitors from diverse backgrounds and cultures, tourism can generate significant revenue for local economies, creating a ripple effect that benefits numerous industries and communities. One of the primary advantages of tourism is its ability to provide both direct and indirect employment opportunities. Hotels, restaurants, and retail establishments hire staff to cater to the needs of tourists, while transportation services, such as taxis and tour operators, also flourish. Additionally, the agriculture sector benefits from tourism, as local farmers supply fresh produce to hotels and restaurants. The service industry, including tour guides, interpreters, and event planners, also experiences a boost in demand. Furthermore, tourism can stimulate infrastructure development, as governments invest in roads, airports, and public facilities to accommodate the influx of visitors. This, in turn, enhances the overall quality of life for residents and provides a competitive edge for the local economy. However, some critics argue that tourism has a darker side, citing the environmental degradation and cultural disruption that can result from an influx of tourists. Overcrowding, pollution, and the exploitation of natural resources are legitimate concerns. In some cases, the influx of outsiders can also erode traditional practices and customs, leading to cultural homogenization.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;The issue of governmental financing for aesthetic features in society has sparked a heated debate. Some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is a waste of national resources and that the money should instead be spent on public services. However, I contend that this investment in the field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.On one hand, the argument that funding the arts is a waste of national resources is understandable. Governments have a responsibility to allocate resources to essential public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. These services are crucial for the well-being and development of a society, and it is natural to prioritize them. However, I would argue that the arts are not mutually exclusive with these services. In fact, they complement each other.Investing in the arts can have numerous benefits for a society. For instance, the arts can play a significant role in promoting cultural heritage and preserving national identity. They can also contribute to the development of tourism, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. Moreover, the arts have the power to inspire, educate, and bring people together, fostering a sense of community and social cohesion. They can also provide a platform for social commentary, critique, and reflection, allowing societies to engage with complex issues and challenge the status quo.Furthermore, the arts can have a positive impact on mental health, education, and social skills. Studies have shown that engaging with the arts can improve cognitive skills, boost self-esteem, and enhance empathy. In this sense, investing in the arts is not a luxury, but a necessity for building a healthy, educated, and compassionate society.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that governmental financing for aesthetic features in society is a worthwhile investment. The arts have the power to enrich, inspire, and transform individuals and communities, and their benefits extend far beyond the realm of entertainment. By allocating resources to the arts, governments can promote cultural development, social cohesion, and individual well-being, ultimately contributing to the betterment of society as a whole.
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";The modern era has witnessed a significant shift in the attitudes of new generations towards employment and education. Unlike their predecessors, who were content with a single, full-time job and a steady income, today's youth are driven to pursue multiple career paths and acquire various higher educational certifications. This change in mindset is largely driven by the quest for financial security and stability.In the past, a single full-time job with a stable income was sufficient for an individual to support themselves and their families. However, the recent recession has brought about a significant economic downturn, affecting almost every country worldwide. As a result, individuals are now compelled to diversify their skill sets and income streams to ensure a secure financial future.The new generation's desire to hold multiple jobs and pursue various higher educational certifications is a direct response to the uncertainty of the modern job market. With the rise of the gig economy and the decline of traditional employment, individuals must be adaptable and possess a range of skills to remain competitive. By acquiring multiple certifications and working multiple jobs, individuals can spread their financial risk and create a safety net for themselves.Moreover, the pursuit of multiple certifications and jobs also allows individuals to explore different passions and interests, leading to a more fulfilling career. This shift in mindset is not only driven by economic necessity but also by a desire for personal growth and development. As the job market continues to evolve, it is likely that this trend will persist, with future generations becoming increasingly versatile and entrepreneurial in their approach to employment and education.
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;The advent of computers has revolutionized the way we live, interact, and navigate our daily lives. While some people argue that computers present more obstacles than benefits in social life, I firmly believe that computers have a profound influence on society and have already begun to shape our lives in significant ways.On one hand, it is true that excessive computer use can lead to social isolation, decreased face-to-face interaction, and a decline in deep, meaningful relationships. However, I argue that this is not a result of the computer itself, but rather a consequence of how we choose to use it. When used responsibly, computers can facilitate connections, foster global communication, and provide access to a vast array of social networks.Computers have already begun to control many aspects of our lives, from the way we work and learn to the way we socialize and entertain ourselves. They have enabled us to stay connected with others across geographical distances, access a vast array of information, and automate many mundane tasks. For instance, online platforms have made it possible for people to connect with others who share similar interests, join communities, and participate in global discussions.Moreover, computers have transformed the way we access information, learn, and develop skills. Online educational resources have democratized access to knowledge, enabling people from all walks of life to acquire new skills and expand their knowledge. Computers have also enabled remote work, flexible schedules, and a better work-life balance, allowing people to manage their personal and professional lives more efficiently.In conclusion, while it is true that computers can present challenges in social life, I firmly believe that their benefits far outweigh their drawbacks. Computers have already begun to shape our lives in significant ways, and their influence will only continue to grow. By using computers responsibly and harnessing their potential, we can build stronger, more connected communities, and create a brighter future for all.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;The traditional emphasis on qualifications in employee selection processes is being challenged by a growing number of employers who are seeking alternative criteria. Social skills, in particular, have emerged as a desirable trait in potential employees. However, some employers still firmly believe that qualifications should be the primary consideration. In this essay, we will explore both sides of the argument and present a nuanced opinion.On one hand, employers who prioritize social skills argue that they are essential for effective communication, teamwork, and problem-solving in the workplace. Employees with strong social skills can foster a positive work environment, build strong relationships with colleagues and clients, and adapt to changing situations. Moreover, social skills are often seen as a better indicator of an employee's potential for growth and development within the organization. For instance, a candidate with excellent communication skills may be more likely to succeed in a customer-facing role than one with a perfect academic record but poor interpersonal skills.On the other hand, employers who emphasize qualifications argue that they provide a clear measure of a candidate's expertise and knowledge in a specific field. Qualifications demonstrate a level of achievement and commitment to a particular profession or industry. Moreover, qualifications can serve as a safeguard against hiring underqualified or unprepared candidates. For example, in fields like law, medicine, or engineering, where the stakes are high and public safety is concerned, employers may prioritize qualifications to ensure that employees have the necessary technical expertise.In my opinion, both qualifications and social skills are important considerations in the employee selection process. While qualifications provide a foundation for expertise and knowledge, social skills are essential for effective collaboration and adaptability in the workplace. Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers both qualifications and social skills is likely to yield the best results. Employers should strive to create a holistic selection process that weighs the importance of both criteria, rather than prioritizing one over the other. By doing so, employers can identify candidates who possess both the technical expertise and interpersonal skills necessary to thrive in their organization.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;The Importance of International Aid: Balancing Global and National ResponsibilitiesIn an increasingly interconnected world, the debate surrounding international aid has become a pressing concern. While some argue that our primary responsibility lies in addressing domestic issues, others contend that international aid is critical in addressing the plight of those facing unimaginable hardships in other countries. This essay will examine the importance of international aid, while also acknowledging the need to support our fellow citizens.It is undeniable that many countries, particularly in Africa, are struggling to meet the basic needs of their citizens. Poverty, hunger, and lack of access to healthcare and education are just a few of the numerous challenges faced by millions of people around the world. International aid is crucial in providing relief and support to these communities, helping to alleviate suffering and promote sustainable development. For instance, organizations such as the United Nations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have made significant strides in combating diseases like malaria and HIV/AIDS, and providing emergency assistance during natural disasters.While it is essential to lend a helping hand to those beyond our national borders, it is equally important to recognize our responsibility to support our fellow citizens. Many people within our own country face significant challenges, including poverty, homelessness, and lack of access to healthcare. It is reasonable to prioritize our national obligations, ensuring that our citizens have access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. However, this does not mean that we should neglect our global responsibilities. In fact, many argue that international aid is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic investment in global stability and security.In conclusion, international aid is critical in addressing the plight of those facing significant hardships in other countries. While it is reasonable to prioritize our national obligations, we must also recognize the importance of supporting our global neighbors. By striking a balance between our domestic and international responsibilities, we can work towards creating a more equitable and just world, where everyone has access to basic necessities and opportunities to thrive.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;The way children study today has undergone a significant transformation compared to previous generations. The widespread availability and relatively low cost of modern technology have been instrumental in this change. With the internet at their fingertips, children now have access to a vast array of educational resources that were previously unimaginable.The internet has opened up a world of alternative sources of knowledge, including online tutorials, educational websites, and digital textbooks. These resources have made it possible for children to learn at their own pace, anytime and anywhere. Moreover, the internet has also enabled children to access a vast array of educational videos, podcasts, and online courses that cater to different learning styles.However, traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge. While technology has made learning more accessible, it is the educators who provide the guidance, support, and motivation that children need to learn effectively. Educators play a crucial role in helping children to navigate the vast array of online resources, to evaluate the credibility of sources, and to develop critical thinking skills.Furthermore, traditional teaching methods provide children with the opportunity to interact with their peers, to engage in discussions, and to develop social skills that are essential for their future success. Educators also provide children with feedback, encouragement, and support that help to build their confidence and motivation to learn.In conclusion, the way children study today is indeed radically different from previous generations. While modern technology has made learning more accessible and convenient, traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge. By combining alternative sources with traditional teaching methods, children can gain a more comprehensive and effective learning experience. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential that educators and policymakers work together to ensure that children have access to the resources and support they need to succeed in their academic pursuits.
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";"The world of sports has always been a unifying force, bringing people together across cultures, borders, and languages. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics, the World Cup, and the Super Bowl, are watched by millions of people from almost every country around the world. These events provide a social stimulus, encouraging people to gather, share, and experience the thrill of competition together. The electrifying atmosphere, the roar of the crowds, and the display of human excellence create a sense of community and belonging among spectators.However, while many people view these sportive events as vital in bridging international divides and fostering global understanding, others see them as mere entertainment, designed to distract people from pressing global issues. Critics argue that the massive resources invested in hosting and broadcasting these events could be better spent on addressing pressing social, economic, and environmental problems. They contend that the spectacle of sports events diverts attention away from the real challenges facing humanity, such as poverty, inequality, and climate change.Moreover, some argue that the nationalistic fervor surrounding these events can actually exacerbate tensions and reinforce divisive identities, rather than promoting unity and cooperation. The intense rivalry between countries, the waving of flags, and the chanting of national anthems can create an ""us versus them"" mentality, reinforcing existing prejudices and biases.Despite these criticisms, global sporting events continue to captivate audiences worldwide. They inspire awe, admiration, and a sense of shared humanity, transcending borders and boundaries. While they may not solve the world's problems, they offer a fleeting respite from the challenges of everyday life, a moment of collective joy and celebration. Ultimately, the significance of these events lies in their ability to bring people together, fostering a sense of global citizenship and shared experience."
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we learn, making education more accessible and convenient than ever before. Distance-learning programs, in particular, have gained immense popularity among students worldwide, and for good reason. By leveraging the power of the internet, students can now access a vast array of educational resources, cutting down on various expenses associated with traditional brick-and-mortar institutions.One of the most significant benefits of distance-learning programs is the substantial reduction in commuting time. Students no longer need to spend hours traveling to and from campus, which not only saves time but also reduces the costs associated with transportation. Additionally, tuition fees and textbook costs are also significantly lower, making higher education more affordable and inclusive. With an internet connection, students can access a vast array of digital resources, including e-books, online tutorials, and virtual classrooms.Long-distance education also provides students with the opportunity to tap into a vast pool of knowledge resources and teaching approaches. Online courses and degree programs offer a diverse range of subjects and specializations, allowing students to pursue their interests and passions without geographical constraints. Furthermore, online learning platforms often incorporate innovative teaching methods, such as interactive simulations, gamification, and multimedia presentations, which cater to different learning styles and enhance the overall learning experience.Moreover, distance-learning programs offer students the flexibility to balance their academic pursuits with other responsibilities, such as work, family, or personal commitments. With the ability to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, students can manage their time more effectively, reducing stress and increasing productivity.In conclusion, distance-learning programs have democratized access to education, offering students a flexible, affordable, and inclusive way to pursue higher learning. With the internet as the primary medium, students can cut down on various expenses, access a vast array of knowledge resources, and experience innovative teaching approaches. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that online learning will become an increasingly integral part of the educational landscape.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;The debate over animal protection has sparked intense discussions among environmentalists, scientists, and the general public. Animal protectionists argue that preserving biodiversity is crucial to maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems. They contend that the loss of a single species can have far-reaching consequences, leading to a cascade of extinctions that ultimately compromise the health of the entire ecosystem.On the other hand, some argue that extinction is a natural process that has been occurring since the dawn of life on Earth. According to the theory of evolution, species are constantly evolving and adapting to their environments. As a result, some species are unable to cope with changes in their ecosystems and eventually become extinct. This process of natural selection has shaped the diversity of life on Earth over millions of years.Moreover, the environment on our planet has undergone numerous transformations since the first species emerged. From dramatic changes in climate to massive geological events, the Earth's ecosystems have been constantly evolving. In this context, extinction can be seen as a natural response to these changes, rather than a catastrophic event that requires human intervention.However, while extinction may be a natural process, human activities have accelerated the rate of extinction to an unprecedented level. Habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change are just a few examples of human-induced stressors that are pushing many species to the brink of extinction. In this context, animal protectionists argue that human intervention is necessary to mitigate the impact of these activities and preserve biodiversity.In conclusion, the argument over animal protection is complex and multifaceted. While extinction may be a natural process, human activities have disrupted the delicate balance of ecosystems, leading to an unprecedented rate of extinction. As such, it is imperative that we take steps to protect and preserve biodiversity, not only for the health of ecosystems but also for the well-being of our planet.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;The Significance of Education and Gender Equality in University AdmissionsIn today's fast-paced, competitive world, education has become the most crucial factor that shapes an individual's future. The opportunities and doors that open up for a person are directly proportional to the quality and level of education they receive. It is imperative that this fundamental right is accessible to all, regardless of gender. In my opinion, there should be no room for partiality in allocating seats to students in university courses based on gender. This stance is supported by several compelling reasons.First and foremost, education is a basic human right, and denying it to anyone based on their gender is a violation of this right. Every individual, regardless of their gender, has the right to pursue their dreams and aspirations. By not discriminating based on gender, we can ensure that every deserving candidate gets an opportunity to excel in their chosen field.Moreover, a gender-neutral admission policy promotes diversity and inclusivity. When men and women from diverse backgrounds come together to learn, they bring with them unique perspectives, ideas, and experiences. This diversity enriches the learning environment, fosters creativity, and prepares students to work in a globalized world.Another significant advantage of a gender-neutral policy is that it helps to bridge the gender gap in various fields. Historically, certain fields like science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have been male-dominated, while others like nursing and teaching have been female-dominated. By not discriminating based on gender, we can encourage more women to take up STEM courses and more men to pursue careers in nursing and teaching, thereby promoting gender equality.Finally, a gender-neutral admission policy sets a positive tone for the rest of the society. When educational institutions, which are considered the bastions of knowledge and wisdom, promote gender equality, it sends out a strong message to the rest of the society. It encourages other institutions and organizations to follow suit, thereby promoting a culture of equality and inclusivity.In conclusion, education is the key to unlocking an individual's potential, and it is essential that we make it accessible to all, regardless of gender. A gender-neutral admission policy is not only a moral imperative but also a pragmatic necessity. By promoting diversity, bridging the gender gap, and setting a positive tone for the rest of the society, we can create a more equitable and just world.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;The advancement of medical care has been a crucial factor in the significant improvement of life expectancy worldwide. The integration of high-tech medical care has revolutionized the way healthcare is delivered, leading to better health outcomes and increased life spans. One of the primary advantages of advanced medical care is that it enables people to receive superior care, resulting in overall better health. This, in turn, has a profound impact on society, particularly in communities with a sizable elderly population.A community with healthy elderly individuals plays a vital role in the sustainable development of a society. Older adults who are in good health can continue to contribute to the community in meaningful ways, such as sharing their wisdom, experience, and skills with younger generations. They can also remain economically active, supporting themselves and their families, and reducing the burden on social security systems. Furthermore, healthy elderly individuals are more likely to maintain their independence, reducing the need for long-term care and the associated costs.In addition, a community with a healthy elderly population can also promote intergenerational relationships, where older adults can act as role models, mentors, and caregivers. This can lead to a more cohesive and supportive community, where individuals of all ages can thrive. Sustainable development is not just about economic growth, but also about creating a society that values and supports the well-being of all its members. By prioritizing advanced medical care and promoting healthy aging, we can create a society that is more equitable, productive, and fulfilling for everyone. In conclusion, the role of advanced medical care in improving life expectancy cannot be overstated, and its impact on creating a sustainable society is undeniable.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;The purpose of education has long been a contentious issue among individuals and society as a whole. While some argue that education should be accessible to all, I firmly believe that it is more beneficial to reserve this type of training for a select group of exceptional learners. By focusing solely on talented students, academic institutions can maintain their high standards of education quality.The primary reason for limiting educational opportunities to gifted students is that it enables universities to cultivate a pool of exceptional talent. By only accepting high-achieving students, universities can provide them with the necessary tools and resources to excel in their fields, ultimately producing better-equipped individuals who can contribute significantly to society. This approach ensures that the most promising minds are nurtured and developed, leading to breakthroughs and innovations that can drive progress and advancement.Furthermore, concentrating on talented students allows universities to tailor their programs to meet the needs of these exceptional learners. By doing so, they can provide a more specialized and effective education, one that caters to the unique requirements and abilities of these students. This, in turn, enables them to reach their full potential and make meaningful contributions to their respective fields.Another significant advantage of this approach is that it enables universities to allocate their resources more efficiently. By focusing on a smaller, more talented pool of students, universities can invest more in each individual, providing them with the necessary support and guidance to succeed. This targeted approach ensures that resources are not wasted on students who may not be as committed or capable, ultimately leading to a more productive and effective use of resources.In conclusion, while some may argue that education should be accessible to all, I firmly believe that it is more beneficial to reserve this type of training for a select group of exceptional learners. By focusing solely on talented students, academic institutions can maintain their high standards of education quality, cultivate exceptional talent, and allocate resources more efficiently. Ultimately, this approach will lead to better human resources for sophisticated purposes, driving progress and advancement in various fields.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The debate over whether schools should prioritize investing in renowned teachers or upgrading facilities has been ongoing. While some argue that having famous teachers is the key to a successful educational experience, I firmly believe that improving facilities is the most beneficial approach for schools.On one hand, having famous teachers can undoubtedly bring numerous benefits to students. For instance, these educators often possess exceptional teaching skills, extensive knowledge, and a strong reputation that can motivate students to learn. Additionally, famous teachers can attract more students to a school, enhancing its reputation and potentially leading to increased funding. However, the advantages of famous teachers are somewhat limited. Once they leave or retire, the school may struggle to maintain its reputation and attract new students.On the other hand, upgrading facilities offers a multitude of long-term benefits that can positively impact students' learning experiences. Modern and well-maintained facilities provide students with a comfortable and conducive environment that fosters engagement, motivation, and productivity. For example, a school with state-of-the-art laboratories, libraries, and sports facilities can provide students with hands-on learning experiences, access to vast resources, and opportunities to develop their skills. Furthermore, improved facilities can also enhance the overall safety and well-being of students, which is essential for their academic success. Unlike famous teachers, upgraded facilities remain a permanent asset to the school, continuing to benefit generations of students to come.In conclusion, while having famous teachers can bring certain advantages, I firmly believe that improving facilities is the best approach for schools. The benefits of upgraded facilities far outweigh those of famous teachers, providing students with a supportive and stimulating environment that can have a lasting impact on their educational journey. By prioritizing facility upgrades, schools can create a solid foundation for academic excellence and set themselves up for long-term success.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;As students navigate the complex world of tertiary education, it is crucial to remember that their field of study should be one that sparks genuine interest and passion. In order to determine which field is right for them, students should not limit themselves to a narrow scope of subjects. Rather, they should explore a broad range of disciplines, allowing themselves to discover their true strengths and interests.Specialization at university is a natural progression of a student's academic journey. However, this process should begin much earlier, during the tertiary education phase. By offering students a wide array of subjects to explore, tertiary education provides the perfect foundation for specialization. Students should be encouraged to delve into various fields, from arts and humanities to sciences and mathematics.By doing so, students can identify areas that captivate their imagination and align with their academic goals. This approach enables them to make informed decisions about their future major, rather than rushing into a specialization without proper exploration. Moreover, exploring multiple subjects fosters a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of disciplines, allowing students to appreciate the complexity and richness of knowledge.Tertiary education should, therefore, provide students with a solid foundation for specialization at university. By allowing students to sample a diverse range of subjects, tertiary education sets the stage for students to discover their true academic passions. As students embark on their academic journey, they should be encouraged to remain open-minded and curious, embracing the opportunity to explore and discover their ideal field of study.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;The idea that adults should engage in playing games, just like children, has gained some traction in recent years. However, in my opinion, this notion is not entirely accurate for several compelling reasons.First and foremost, the pressures of work and family commitments often force adults to abandon their lifelong hobbies, including playing games. As people enter adulthood, their responsibilities multiply, leaving them with limited time and energy to devote to leisure activities. The demands of career advancement, raising a family, and managing a household can be overwhelming, making it challenging for adults to prioritize playing games. Unlike children, who have the luxury of free time and a carefree schedule, adults must often sacrifice their personal interests for the sake of their professional and familial obligations.Furthermore, the type of games that adults engage in may not be the same as those enjoyed by children. Adults may prefer more intellectually stimulating activities, such as strategy games or puzzles, which serve as a form of mental relaxation and stress relief. In contrast, children's games are often designed to promote physical activity, social interaction, and imagination. While these benefits are essential for children's development, adults may not require the same level of physical activity or social interaction, making games less of a priority.Additionally, adults have a wide range of other hobbies and interests that they can pursue in their free time, such as reading, traveling, or learning a new skill. These activities can provide a sense of fulfillment and personal growth, making games less necessary for their overall well-being. In conclusion, while playing games can be a fun and engaging activity, it is not essential for adults. The pressures of work and family commitments, combined with the availability of other hobbies and interests, make games a lower priority for adults.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";The advent of modern technology has profoundly impacted cultures around the world, bridging geographical divides and fostering a sense of global homogenization. One of the most striking consequences of this phenomenon is the emergence of a single, modern culture that transcends traditional cultural boundaries.A compelling example of this trend is the ubiquity of software applications such as Microsoft, which has become an indispensable tool for students worldwide. Whether in Iran or Canada, students rely on the same technology to complete their homework, prepare presentations, and collaborate with peers. This shared experience has created a sense of familiarity and commonality among young people from diverse cultural backgrounds, blurring the lines between traditional cultural identities.The proliferation of social media platforms, online marketplaces, and streaming services has further accelerated this process. People from different parts of the world can now access the same information, consume the same entertainment, and engage in similar online activities, creating a shared cultural lexicon. This has led to a homogenization of cultural practices, as local customs and traditions are influenced by global trends and vice versa.Moreover, the internet has enabled the free flow of ideas, fostering a global cultural exchange that was previously unimaginable. People can now learn about and engage with different cultures, adopting and adapting elements that resonate with them. This has given rise to a new, hybrid culture that blends local traditions with global influences, creating a distinctive, modern cultural identity.In conclusion, modern technology has given rise to a single, modern culture that is characterized by shared experiences, global connectivity, and cultural exchange. As people from diverse backgrounds interact and engage with each other online, they are creating a new, hybrid culture that reflects the complexities and diversity of our increasingly interconnected world.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;The role of family in achieving success has been a topic of discussion in recent years. While some people argue that family assistance is essential for success, I firmly believe that family plays a more significant role in helping individuals pursue their goals.Firstly, a supportive family provides a stable and secure environment that allows individuals to focus on their aspirations. Growing up in a loving and encouraging family setting instills confidence and motivation, which are crucial for overcoming obstacles and staying committed to one's goals. For instance, a child who receives consistent support and guidance from their family is more likely to develop a strong sense of self-belief and perseverance, essential qualities for achieving success.Secondly, family members often possess valuable knowledge and experience that can be shared with their loved ones. Parents, siblings, and other relatives can offer insightful advice, mentorship, and networking opportunities that can greatly benefit an individual's career or personal pursuits. Additionally, family members can provide emotional support during times of struggle, helping to alleviate stress and anxiety that can hinder progress. This emotional safety net can be particularly important during periods of uncertainty or failure, allowing individuals to bounce back and continue striving for their objectives.Furthermore, a strong family network can also provide access to resources and opportunities that may not be available otherwise. For example, a family member may have connections in a particular industry or be able to provide financial support, enabling an individual to pursue their passions without undue burden. By having a supportive family, individuals can tap into these resources and increase their chances of success.In conclusion, while some people may view family assistance as essential, I firmly believe that family plays a more critical role in helping individuals achieve success. By providing a supportive environment, valuable knowledge, emotional support, and access to resources, family members can greatly contribute to an individual's pursuit of their goals. As such, it is imperative to recognize and appreciate the significant impact that family can have on one's journey to success.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";Reading Fiction vs. Watching Movies: A Comparative AnalysisWhen it comes to leisure activities, people often find themselves torn between reading fiction and watching movies. While both mediums have their unique charms, reading fiction offers a more enjoyable experience than watching movies for several compelling reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay closer attention to details, allowing readers to immerse themselves in the narrative more effectively. Unlike movies, which often sacrifice depth for brevity due to time constraints, novels can explore complex characters, plot twists, and themes with greater nuance. This richly detailed storytelling enables readers to engage more intimately with the story, fostering a deeper emotional connection with the characters and their journeys.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient than watching a movie. With the busy lives we lead, it can be challenging to dedicate two hours to watching a movie in one sitting. In contrast, fiction books offer the flexibility to read at one's own pace, whenever and wherever. Many novels are compact, with some spanning only around 100 pages, making them easily digestible in shorter intervals. This adaptability is particularly advantageous for students, who often find themselves with limited time to spare. Unlike watching a movie, which requires an uninterrupted block of time, reading a novel can be done in short bursts, allowing readers to fit it into their busy schedules.For instance, if I have only 15 minutes to spare before studying, I can easily read a chapter or two, whereas watching a movie is impossible in such a short timeframe. This flexibility makes reading fiction a more practical and enjoyable option for those with hectic lifestyles.In conclusion, reading fiction surpasses watching movies in terms of attention to detail and convenience. Whether it's the immersive experience offered by detailed storytelling or the flexibility to read at one's own pace, reading fiction provides a more enjoyable leisure activity for those seeking a engaging and practical pastime.
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";The notion of adopting a single language across the globe has sparked intense debate among linguists, anthropologists, and cultural enthusiasts. Some argue that this would be a positive change, facilitating communication and fostering global understanding. Proponents of this idea contend that a single language would alleviate the challenges faced by travelers in their daily activities.One of the primary advantages of a single language is the ease of navigation in unfamiliar territories. Travelers would no longer struggle to communicate with locals, making everyday tasks like ordering food at a restaurant or asking for directions a seamless experience. This would undoubtedly enhance the overall travel experience, allowing individuals to fully immerse themselves in foreign cultures without the burden of language barriers.Furthermore, a single language would mitigate misunderstandings between people from diverse linguistic backgrounds. In a world where everyone speaks the same language, the risk of misinterpretation and miscommunication would be significantly reduced. This, in turn, would foster greater collaboration, cooperation, and mutual understanding among nations, ultimately contributing to a more harmonious and peaceful world.However, it is also worth considering the potential drawbacks of a single language. The loss of linguistic diversity would inevitably lead to the erosion of cultural identities and the homogenization of traditions. Additionally, the imposition of a single language could be seen as a form of cultural imperialism, where dominant languages are imposed upon marginalized communities.In conclusion, while the adoption of a single language may seem like a panacea for the challenges of global communication, it is crucial to weigh the benefits against the potential costs. A single language may facilitate travel and reduce misunderstandings, but it is essential to preserve the rich tapestry of linguistic diversity that makes human culture so vibrant and unique.
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;The world is undergoing a transformative era, marked by unprecedented technological advancements at a breakneck speed. This relentless progress is redefining the fabric of our lives, propelling us towards an era of unparalleled convenience. Among the most significant beneficiaries of this technological boom is the field of medical science.Over the past decade, the strides made in medical science have been nothing short of phenomenal. Groundbreaking discoveries, innovative treatments, and cutting-edge technologies have cumulatively contributed to a significant improvement in healthcare. The advent of advanced diagnostic tools, precision medicines, and gene editing technologies such as CRISPR have empowered medical professionals to tackle complex diseases with enhanced efficacy. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms has streamlined clinical processes, enabling quicker diagnoses and more personalized treatment plans.The impact of these advancements on human health has been profound. Life expectancy has increased, while the incidence of previously debilitating diseases has decreased. Moreover, the quality of life for individuals living with chronic conditions has improved dramatically, thanks to novel therapies and better disease management strategies. These achievements are not only a testament to human ingenuity but also a reflection of our collective pursuit of a healthier and happier world.The far-reaching consequences of these medical breakthroughs extend beyond the realm of healthcare. A healthier population is more productive, innovative, and economically resilient. It is a cornerstone of a society that is not only better equipped to tackle challenges but also more inclined to pursue happiness. In conclusion, the phenomenal progress in medical science over the past decade is a milestone in our collective journey towards a more convenient, healthier, and happier world.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;The question of whether to teach financial management to juvenile students has sparked a contentious debate. While some argue that introducing children to money management at a young age can have adverse effects, others firmly believe that it is a vital skill that should be imparted to high school students. In my opinion, I strongly agree that higher school students should be made aware of the importance of money management.First and foremost, the reality is that money is an integral part of our daily lives. From a young age, children are exposed to various forms of advertisements and marketing tactics that lure them into spending. By teaching financial management in schools, students can develop the necessary skills to make informed decisions about their financial resources. This includes understanding the value of money, the importance of saving, and the consequences of overspending.Moreover, teaching financial management to high school students can help them develop a sense of responsibility and independence. As they grow older, they will be expected to make financial decisions that will impact their future. By equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills, they can make informed choices about their education, career, and personal life.Another significant benefit of teaching financial management to high school students is that it can help them avoid debt and financial pitfalls. Many young adults struggle with debt and financial insecurity due to a lack of understanding of personal finance. By educating them on the basics of money management, they can avoid common financial mistakes and build a stable financial foundation.In conclusion, while some may argue that teaching financial management to juvenile students can have negative consequences, I firmly believe that it is a crucial life skill that should be imparted to high school students. By doing so, we can empower them with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed financial decisions, develop a sense of responsibility, and build a stable financial future.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;Smoking should be strictly prohibited in restaurants due to its adverse effects on non-smokers' comfort, health, and the overall dining experience. Restaurants are establishments where people gather to enjoy a meal, relax, and socialize. However, when smoking is permitted, it creates an uncomfortable environment for non-smokers, who are exposed to second-hand smoke involuntarily. This not only spoils their dining experience but also puts their health at risk.Furthermore, restaurants are frequented by people of all ages, including children, grandparents, and pregnant women. Permitting smoking in these establishments sets a bad example, especially for children, who may be influenced to take up the habit. Moreover, smoking in restaurants can have serious health implications for these vulnerable groups, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and birth defects.The issue of passive smoking is another significant concern. Non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke in restaurants are at risk of developing the same health problems as active smokers, despite not smoking themselves. This is unfair, as they have no control over their exposure to smoke and are still subjected to its harmful effects. In fact, studies have shown that passive smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious health issues.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants. It is essential to protect the health, comfort, and well-being of non-smokers, particularly vulnerable groups such as children, grandparents, and pregnant women. Restaurants should be smoke-free zones, ensuring that all patrons can enjoy their meals in a healthy and comfortable environment. By banning smoking in restaurants, we can promote a healthier and more considerate community.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;The proliferation of violent behavior in films has become a disturbing trend over the past two decades. It has reached an alarming level, where filmmakers are using violence as a marketing tool to attract audiences and generate buzz around their movies. However, this approach has severe consequences, particularly on the younger generation. From my perspective, the depiction of violence in movies has far-reaching negative effects on youngsters, impacting their behavior, emotions, and academic performance.Exposure to violent content in films can desensitize youngsters to the consequences of aggression, leading to a rise in aggressive behavior. Children and adolescents who are repeatedly exposed to violent scenes may begin to view violence as an acceptable means of resolving conflicts, rather than seeking peaceful solutions. This can result in a surge in bullying, fights, and other forms of aggression among young people. Furthermore, the glorification of violence in movies can also contribute to a decline in empathy and compassion among youngsters, making them less likely to understand and appreciate the feelings of others.The emotional well-being of youngsters is also at risk due to the prevalence of violence in movies. Exposure to violent content can lead to increased anxiety, fear, and stress levels among children and adolescents. This can result in a range of emotional and psychological problems, including nightmares, bedwetting, and depression. Moreover, the constant bombardment of violent images can also lead to a decline in self-esteem and confidence among youngsters, making them more vulnerable to peer pressure and social influences.Lastly, the depiction of violence in movies can also have a detrimental impact on the academic performance of youngsters. Exposure to violent content can reduce concentration and attention span, making it difficult for youngsters to focus on their studies. Moreover, the constant exposure to violent images can also lead to a decline in interest in academic pursuits, as youngsters become more attracted to the thrill and excitement of violent content.In conclusion, the growing trend of violence in movies has severe consequences for youngsters, impacting their behavior, emotions, and academic performance. It is essential for filmmakers to take responsibility and consider the potential impact of their movies on young audiences. By promoting alternative and more positive forms of entertainment, we can help to mitigate the negative effects of violence in movies and promote a more positive and peaceful environment for our youngsters.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";"The age-old adage ""information is power"" holds significant weight in today's fast-paced, knowledge-driven world. The importance of being well-informed cannot be overstated, as it empowers individuals to make informed decisions, form opinions, and navigate the complexities of modern life. One of the key reasons why being well-informed is crucial is that it allows us to separate fact from fiction, ensuring that our understanding of events and issues is rooted in reality rather than speculation or misinformation.To guarantee the reliability of information, it is essential to consult a diverse range of sources. Relying on a single source or perspective can lead to a skewed understanding of a topic, whereas consulting multiple sources provides a more comprehensive and balanced view. This is particularly important in today's digital age, where misinformation and disinformation can spread rapidly through social media and other online platforms. By cross-referencing information and evaluating the credibility of sources, we can increase the accuracy of our knowledge and make more informed decisions.Knowing facts about events or issues, rather than relying on estimates or speculation, is also vital. Facts provide a solid foundation for understanding, allowing us to analyze and interpret information with confidence. In contrast, estimates or speculation can lead to misconceptions and misinterpretations, which can have serious consequences. By seeking out verifiable facts and data, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world around us and make more informed choices.In conclusion, the importance of being well-informed cannot be overstated. By consulting multiple sources, verifying the reliability of information, and seeking out facts, we can empower ourselves to make informed decisions, navigate the complexities of modern life, and truly harness the power of information."
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;"The preservation of old buildings is a perennial concern for governments, often sparking debate between the competing interests of providing housing for citizens and protecting cultural heritage. In my opinion, it is essential to conserve all old buildings that significantly contribute to our cultural identity.On one hand, the demand for housing is a pressing issue that governments cannot afford to ignore. As populations continue to grow, the need for affordable and accessible housing becomes increasingly urgent. Demolishing old buildings to make way for modern developments may seem like a pragmatic solution to address this shortage. However, this approach comes at a significant cultural cost.Old buildings are not just mere structures; they are tangible links to our past, embodying the history, traditions, and values of our ancestors. They provide a unique window into the cultural, social, and economic context of bygone eras, allowing us to learn from and appreciate the achievements of previous generations. By preserving these buildings, we can safeguard our cultural heritage and ensure that future generations can continue to draw inspiration and knowledge from them.Furthermore, old buildings can be adaptively reused, incorporating modern amenities while retaining their original character. This approach not only preserves our cultural legacy but also provides innovative solutions to the housing crisis. For instance, converted historic buildings can be transformed into boutique hotels, art galleries, or museums, generating revenue and creating jobs while maintaining their cultural significance.In conclusion, the preservation of old buildings that contribute to our cultural heritage should be prioritized. By conserving these structures, we can protect our collective memory, promote cultural understanding, and inspire future generations. While the pressure to address housing needs is real, it is essential to adopt a balanced approach that reconciles these competing interests, ensuring that our cultural legacy is preserved for years to come."
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;The widespread use of mobile phones among young people has become a ubiquitous phenomenon in today's society. Many young individuals consider their mobile phones as an indispensable part of their daily lives. However, despite the numerous benefits that mobile phones offer, such as instant access to information and connectivity with others, I firmly believe that the popularity of mobile phones among the young generation is a detrimental development.Firstly, the excessive use of mobile phones has a profound impact on the academic performance of young people. Many students are struggling in school due to the constant distraction posed by their mobile phones. The temptation to check social media, play games, or text friends can be overwhelming, leading to divided attention and poor academic results. As a result, young people are failing to reach their full potential, and their future prospects are being compromised.Secondly, the possession of mobile phones has been linked to the development of materialistic tendencies among juveniles. The constant bombardment of advertisements and social media posts showcasing the latest gadgets and trends can foster a sense of entitlement and a desire for the latest technology. This can lead to an excessive focus on material possessions and a decline in values such as hard work, thriftiness, and contentment. Furthermore, the pressure to keep up with the latest phone models can create a sense of anxiety and stress among young people, as they feel compelled to constantly upgrade their devices.In conclusion, while mobile phones offer many benefits, their popularity among young people is a bad development. The negative impact on academic performance and the promotion of materialistic values are just two of the many reasons why I believe that young people should be discouraged from excessive mobile phone use.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";The debate surrounding fixed punishments for crimes has been a longstanding one, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. On one hand, the implementation of fixed punishments can have unintended consequences, potentially leading to an increase in criminal activity. Professional criminals, who are well-versed in the law, will be fully aware of the punishment they face if caught. This knowledge can embolden them, as they will be able to weigh the risks and rewards of their actions with precision. In some cases, the fixed punishment may not be severe enough to deter them, leading to an increase in crime.On the other hand, fixed punishments can have several benefits. One of the primary advantages is the reduction in time taken by judges to deliver judgments. With a clear and predetermined punishment for each type of crime, judges can quickly and efficiently dispense justice, without the need for lengthy deliberations. This not only saves time but also reduces the burden on the judicial system, allowing it to function more smoothly.Furthermore, fixed punishments can be economically beneficial for the government. By streamlining the judicial process, the government can save on the costs associated with lengthy trials and deliberations. Additionally, with a clear and predictable punishment system, the government can better allocate resources, focusing on prevention and rehabilitation rather than lengthy and costly trials.In conclusion, while fixed punishments may have some drawbacks, such as potentially increasing crime among professional criminals, the benefits of a streamlined judicial process and economic efficiency cannot be ignored. A balanced approach, taking into account the severity of the crime and the circumstances surrounding it, may be the most effective way to implement fixed punishments. Ultimately, the goal of the justice system should be to deliver fair and effective justice, and fixed punishments can be a useful tool in achieving this goal.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap air fares has revolutionized the travel industry, opening up a world of possibilities for many people, particularly those from lower-income groups. With affordable flights, individuals who previously couldn't afford to travel can now explore new destinations, experience different cultures, and connect with others across the globe. This increased accessibility has bridged geographical divides, fostering global understanding and economic growth.However, the proliferation of flights has also led to the expansion of airports, resulting in busier and more congested airspaces. This, in turn, has significant environmental implications. The increased air traffic has led to a surge in air pollution, affecting the health and well-being of people living and working in close proximity to airports. The constant stream of takeoffs and landings releases a cocktail of pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds, which can exacerbate respiratory issues and other health problems.Furthermore, the burning of plane fuel releases carbon dioxide into the environment, contributing to climate change. As the Earth's temperature continues to rise, the consequences of global warming become increasingly apparent, from melting polar ice caps to extreme weather events. The aviation industry's carbon footprint is significant, accounting for around 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. While cheap air fares have democratized travel, it is essential to acknowledge the environmental costs associated with this trend.To mitigate these effects, the aviation industry must prioritize sustainability. This can be achieved through the adoption of cleaner fuels, more efficient aircraft designs, and optimized flight routes. Additionally, governments and regulatory bodies can implement policies to reduce emissions, such as carbon offsetting schemes and taxes on polluting fuels. Ultimately, striking a balance between accessibility and environmental responsibility is crucial to ensure that the benefits of cheap air fares are not overshadowed by their ecological costs.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;The debate about whether to live in a small town or a big city has been ongoing for years. While some people prefer the tranquility and close-knit community of a small town, others, like myself, prefer the fast-paced and dynamic lifestyle of a big city. Despite the advantages of small town life, I firmly believe that living in a big city is the better choice for me, and here's why.First and foremost, finding a job is a top priority for me, and living in a big city makes it much easier to achieve this goal. With a plethora of companies and industries concentrated in one area, the job market is highly competitive, and opportunities are abundant. Moreover, many big cities offer a range of accommodation options, making it possible to find a place to live that is conveniently located near my workplace, saving me time, money, and stress.Another significant advantage of living in a big city is the access to modern facilities and amenities. From state-of-the-art hospitals and medical facilities to world-class shopping malls and entertainment centers, big cities offer a level of convenience and luxury that is hard to find in smaller towns. Additionally, the diversity of restaurants, cafes, and cultural events in big cities means that I can enjoy a wide range of cuisines and experiences that cater to my interests.Finally, living in a big city means being constantly exposed to stimulation and information. With the internet, social media, and 24-hour news cycles, I am always connected to the world and up-to-date with the latest developments. This constant flow of information keeps my mind engaged, and I feel like I am always learning something new. Furthermore, the diversity of people and cultures in big cities means that I am constantly meeting new people, hearing different perspectives, and broadening my understanding of the world.In conclusion, while small towns have their charm, I firmly believe that living in a big city is the better choice for me. With its abundant job opportunities, modern facilities, and constant stimulation, big city life offers a level of convenience, luxury, and engagement that I couldn't find in a small town.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;Title: Rewarding Employees: The Power of Professional TrainingIn today's competitive business landscape, recognizing and rewarding employees for their outstanding performance is crucial for driving motivation, productivity, and job satisfaction. While salary increases and promotions to new positions are indeed common and effective ways to acknowledge good work, I firmly believe that providing professional training is another vital aspect that can significantly encourage further good work.On one hand, salary increases and promotions serve as tangible rewards that employees can appreciate, as they often translate to a higher standard of living and increased job security. These rewards can motivate employees to strive for excellence, as they provide a clear incentive for hard work and dedication. However, these methods may not necessarily foster personal and professional growth, which is essential for long-term job satisfaction and success.On the other hand, providing professional training offers a more holistic approach to rewarding employees. By investing in their skills and knowledge, organizations demonstrate a genuine interest in their employees' career advancement and well-being. This, in turn, boosts employees' confidence, job security, and motivation, as they feel valued and empowered to take on new challenges. Professional training also enables employees to stay up-to-date with industry developments, enhancing their overall performance and contributions to the organization.Moreover, professional training can have a ripple effect, leading to a more skilled and adaptable workforce. As employees acquire new skills and expertise, they become more versatile and better equipped to handle diverse tasks and responsibilities. This, in turn, enhances the organization's overall performance, innovation, and competitiveness.In conclusion, while salary increases and promotions are essential rewards, providing professional training is a valuable complement to these methods. By investing in their employees' growth and development, organizations can create a more motivated, skilled, and productive workforce, ultimately driving business success and sustainability.
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;The traditional university setting, where students are required to attend classes, has been a long-standing norm in higher education. However, with the rapid advancement of technology and the availability of diverse learning resources, it is time to reconsider the necessity of mandatory class attendance. In fact, attending classes in the university should be optional for students, allowing them to take ownership of their learning process and explore alternative methods that suit their individual needs.In today's digital age, students have access to a plethora of learning materials and resources outside the classroom. Online lectures, tutorials, and educational videos can provide comprehensive knowledge on various subjects, often in a more engaging and flexible manner than traditional lectures. Moreover, online resources can be accessed at any time and from any location, allowing students to learn at their own pace and convenience. By making class attendance optional, students can take advantage of these resources and learn in a way that is most effective for them.Furthermore, university libraries offer a conducive environment for self-study, where students can focus on topics they struggle with without the distractions and time constraints of a traditional classroom setting. With the freedom to choose when and how they study, students can delve deeper into complex subjects, reinforce their understanding, and develop a more nuanced grasp of the material. This autonomous learning approach can foster a more meaningful and lasting understanding of the subject matter.Additionally, optional class attendance can cater to different learning styles and preferences. Some students may thrive in a collaborative environment, while others may prefer independent study. By giving students the flexibility to choose their learning approach, universities can promote a more inclusive and supportive learning environment.In conclusion, making class attendance optional can empower students to take charge of their learning process, explore alternative resources, and develop a more personalized approach to education. By embracing this shift, universities can provide a more flexible, inclusive, and effective learning environment that caters to the diverse needs and preferences of their students.
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;As I near the completion of my university studies, I find myself pondering the age-old dilemma of whether to settle in a small town or a bustling metropolis. While both options have their charms, I am increasingly convinced that big city life is the way to go, and for good reason.First and foremost, the city offers unparalleled job prospects, especially in my field of engineering. The sheer density of industries, startups, and corporations in urban centers means that I will have a far greater chance of securing a coveted position in my field. This is in stark contrast to smaller towns, where opportunities are scarce and often limited to a handful of employers. In a city, I will be able to choose from a diverse range of companies, allowing me to pick the one that best aligns with my skills and interests.Beyond the realm of career advancement, city life offers a rich tapestry of social and cultural experiences. The urban jungle is teeming with a vast array of bars, cafes, and restaurants, providing me and my friends with endless options for entertainment and socialization. Whether it's a night out on the town, a leisurely brunch, or a quiet coffee, the city has something for everyone. This diversity of activities will not only enrich my personal life but also provide me with a unique opportunity to expand my social circle and build meaningful connections.Lastly, the city boasts superior medical facilities, a consideration that should not be taken lightly. In the unlikely event of a medical emergency, I will have access to top-tier hospitals, specialized clinics, and cutting-edge treatments. This peace of mind is invaluable, and a luxury that I am not willing to compromise on.In conclusion, the advantages of city life far outweigh those of small-town living. With its abundance of job opportunities, diverse social scene, and world-class medical facilities, the metropolis is the perfect setting for me to launch my career, build a fulfilling social life, and secure my well-being. As I prepare to embark on this new chapter of my life, I am increasingly confident that the city is where I belong.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;The advent of the computer is a monumental milestone in the development of advanced technology. In my opinion, computers have revolutionized our lives by introducing unparalleled convenience and ease. One of the most significant contributions of computers is their ability to facilitate easier access to information. With the internet at our fingertips, we can now access a vast wealth of knowledge and data with just a few clicks. This has transformed the way we learn, work, and navigate our daily lives.Computers have also significantly enhanced the quality of communication. Email, instant messaging, and video conferencing have made it possible to connect with people across the globe in real-time, regardless of geographical distance. This has opened up new avenues for collaboration, social interaction, and global understanding. The ease of communication has also enabled businesses to expand their reach, connect with customers, and operate more efficiently.Furthermore, computers have automated many mundane tasks, freeing up time for more creative and intellectual pursuits. They have also enabled the development of new industries, such as software engineering, data analysis, and digital media. In addition, computers have improved healthcare outcomes by facilitating medical research, diagnosis, and treatment.However, the benefits of computers extend beyond the professional realm. They have also transformed the way we live and entertain ourselves. With the rise of e-commerce, online shopping, and digital entertainment, we can now access a vast array of products, services, and leisure activities from the comfort of our own homes. Overall, the advent of computers has brought about a seismic shift in the way we live, work, and interact with one another. As technology continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see the new innovations and opportunities that emerge from this digital revolution.
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;The concept of working from home has gained significant traction in recent years, with many people considering it an ideal arrangement. However, some individuals argue that working from home brings too much convenience, leading to a lack of productivity and motivation. I strongly disagree with this perspective, as I believe that working from home can be beneficial for many workers.On the surface, working from home seems like a dream come true. No commute, no office distractions, and the freedom to create one's own schedule. However, this convenience can often be a double-edged sword. Without the structure and accountability of an office environment, it can be easy to fall into bad habits and procrastination. Moreover, the lack of pressure and motivation that comes with working from home can lead to a decrease in productivity and overall performance.Furthermore, working from home can also lead to a lack of interaction and socialization. Humans are social creatures, and we thrive on interaction and communication with others. Working from home can be isolating, and the absence of face-to-face interaction can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection. This can have negative impacts on mental health and overall well-being.In addition, the best conditions for working from home are not always ideal. Distractions at home, such as family members, television, and social media, can be significant barriers to productivity. Moreover, the lack of resources and support that comes with working from home can make it difficult to complete tasks and meet deadlines.In conclusion, while working from home may seem like a convenient and ideal arrangement, it is not without its disadvantages. The lack of pressure and interaction, combined with the potential distractions and lack of resources, can make it a challenging and unproductive environment. Therefore, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons of working from home and consider the individual's needs and circumstances before making a decision.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;The Role of Professors: Balancing Research and Course PreparationThe primary responsibility of professors is to educate students, but many institutions prioritize research over course preparation. This approach can have detrimental consequences for students and universities alike. Professors should allocate more time to preparing courses, as it is essential for providing quality education and maintaining the reputation of academic institutions.When professors focus excessively on research, they may neglect their teaching duties, leading to subpar course materials and inadequate instruction. This can result in poorly prepared students, who may struggle to grasp complex concepts and develop essential skills. Moreover, students may feel frustrated and disillusioned with the education system, which can harm the reputation of universities. In today's competitive academic landscape, institutions must prioritize student satisfaction and academic excellence to maintain their standing.However, this is not to say that research has no place in academia. On the contrary, professors can effectively integrate research into their teaching, using projects and real-world examples to illustrate complex concepts. By doing so, they can provide students with hands-on experience, preparing them for the demands of their chosen field. This approach not only enhances student learning but also fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter.In conclusion, professors should strike a balance between research and course preparation. By allocating sufficient time to preparing courses, professors can ensure that students receive a high-quality education, which is essential for their academic and professional success. By integrating research into their teaching, professors can provide students with a rich and engaging learning experience, ultimately upholding the reputation of academic institutions. Ultimately, the primary responsibility of professors is to educate and inspire students, and they must prioritize their teaching duties to fulfill this obligation.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;The relentless march of technology has been a defining feature of the modern era, transforming the fabric of our society, economy, and individual lives. One of the most significant impacts of technological development has been its role in prompting economic growth and improving living standards. As technology advances, it opens up new avenues for economic activity, creates new industries, and enhances productivity across existing ones. This, in turn, leads to increased employment opportunities, higher incomes, and a better quality of life for individuals.Advanced technology also plays a crucial role in enhancing healthcare standards and improving living levels. With the advent of sophisticated medical technologies, diseases that were once thought incurable are now being managed and even cured. Furthermore, advancements in health monitoring, diagnostics, and personalized medicine have significantly improved health outcomes, enabling people to live healthier and longer lives.However, the positive impacts of technology are not without their drawbacks. One of the most pressing concerns is the environmental impact of technological progress. The production and disposal of technological devices contribute to pollution, e-waste, and climate change. Moreover, the extraction and processing of raw materials necessary for technological manufacturing strain natural resources and ecosystems.Society also faces challenges in the wake of rapid technological change. Job displacement due to automation, privacy concerns with data collection, and social isolation exacerbated by digital communication platforms are just a few examples of the negative societal effects of technology. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancement can leave behind those who are unable to adapt quickly, widening social and economic inequalities.In conclusion, while the development of technology undoubtedly brings numerous benefits, including economic growth and improved living standards, it also poses significant environmental and societal challenges. It is crucial that we harness the power of technology in a way that is sustainable, equitable, and responsible, ensuring that the benefits are shared by all and the costs minimized. Only through such a balanced approach can we ensure that technological progress serves the betterment of humanity and the planet we inhabit.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. The welfare state is a system in which the government takes responsibility for ensuring the well-being of its citizens, particularly in terms of healthcare. This means that governments must prioritize the health and well-being of their citizens, not just by providing medical treatment, but also by investing in preventive measures and education.In this regard, it is crucial that governments allocate a significant portion of their budget towards healthcare and health education. However, the focus should not be solely on treating illnesses, but also on preventing them. Governments should prioritize education and prevention over treatment, as it is more cost-effective and sustainable in the long run.Investing in prevention and education can lead to a significant reduction in healthcare costs. By educating citizens on healthy habits, disease prevention, and early detection, governments can prevent illnesses from occurring in the first place. Moreover, prevention and education can also reduce the burden on healthcare systems, allowing for more efficient use of resources.Furthermore, prevention and education can have long-term benefits, such as reducing the prevalence of chronic diseases, improving mental health, and promoting healthy lifestyles. By investing in education and prevention, governments can create a healthier and more productive society, which can lead to economic benefits, such as increased productivity and reduced absenteeism.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment. This approach is not only cost-effective, but also sustainable and beneficial for the overall well-being of citizens. By prioritizing education and prevention, governments can create a healthier and more productive society, which is essential for the success and prosperity of any nation.
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;The decision of where to live while pursuing higher education is a crucial one, with many students facing the dilemma of choosing between university dormitories and apartments in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages, and the ideal choice depends on individual preferences and priorities.On one hand, university dormitories offer a sense of community and camaraderie, with students from various backgrounds living together and sharing experiences. Dorms also provide convenient access to university facilities, such as libraries and gyms, and are often located close to lecture halls and other academic buildings. However, dorms can be noisy and crowded, with shared living spaces and limited personal freedom.On the other hand, apartments in the city offer more independence and freedom, allowing students to create their own living environment and schedule. Apartments also provide more space and comfort, with students able to choose their own roommates and living arrangements. However, apartments can be expensive, especially in city centers, and may require a longer commute to university.After considering the level of freedom, studying conditions, and economic factor, I would prefer living in an apartment. While dorms offer a sense of community, I value my independence and freedom to create my own living environment. Apartments also provide better studying conditions, with quieter and more private spaces that allow for focused learning. Additionally, while apartments may be more expensive, the benefits of independence and comfort outweigh the costs.In conclusion, the decision of where to live while pursuing higher education is a personal one, with both university dormitories and apartments having their advantages and disadvantages. While dorms offer a sense of community, apartments provide independence, freedom, and better studying conditions, making them my preferred choice.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"The film ""Click"" is a thought-provoking comedy that delves into the significant issue of achieving a balance between family and work life. At its core, the movie is a commentary on the human experience, exploring themes of love, humaneness, and the often-overlooked dark sides of society.On the surface, ""Click"" appears to be a light-hearted comedy, with Adam Sandler's signature humor taking center stage. However, as the movie progresses, it becomes clear that the film is tackling much deeper issues. The protagonist, Michael Newman, is a workaholic who becomes obsessed with a universal remote control that allows him to fast-forward through the mundane aspects of his life. As he becomes increasingly dependent on the remote, he begins to neglect his relationships with his family and friends, leading to a downward spiral of chaos and destruction.Through Michael's journey, the film highlights the importance of maintaining a balance between work and family life. It serves as a reminder that while professional success is important, it is not worth sacrificing one's personal relationships and overall well-being. The movie also touches on the theme of humaneness, emphasizing the need for empathy and compassion in our interactions with others.Moreover, ""Click"" sheds light on the dark sides of society, specifically the cult of consumerism and the constant pursuit of material possessions. Michael's obsession with the remote control serves as a metaphor for the ways in which we often prioritize convenience and efficiency over meaningful human connections.In conclusion, ""Click"" is a film that masterfully blends comedy and drama to convey a serious message about the importance of balance and humaneness in our lives. Through its thought-provoking themes and witty humor, the movie serves as a reminder to reevaluate our priorities and focus on what truly matters."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;The Media's Obsession with Celebrity Lives: Weighing the DisadvantagesIn today's world, the media's focus on the personal lives of famous individuals has become a staple of modern entertainment. However, in my opinion, the disadvantages of this phenomenon far outweigh its advantages. The excessive emphasis on celebrity gossip has led to a culture of misinformation, sensationalism, and distraction from pressing social issues.First and foremost, the media's reliance on gossip often involves the use of misleading images and headlines designed to boost newspaper sales or excite public opinion. This not only leads to the invasion of celebrities' privacy but also perpetuates false narratives and contributes to the spread of misinformation. For instance, a celebrity's innocent social media post can be blown out of proportion, sparking unnecessary controversy and debate. This type of reporting undermines the credibility of the media and reinforces the notion that truth is secondary to ratings.Moreover, the media's sensationalism and focus on celebrity lives distract viewers from pressing public and social problems. Instead of devoting resources to investigating and reporting on critical issues like climate change, inequality, or social justice, the media prioritizes trivial stories about celebrities' personal lives. This not only creates a culture of distraction but also reinforces the notion that the media is more interested in entertaining than informing. As a result, the public remains misinformed and disengaged from the issues that truly matter.Furthermore, the media's obsession with celebrity lives also has a negative impact on our cultural values. By prioritizing fame and celebrity status, we reinforce the idea that these are the ultimate measures of success and happiness. This can have damaging effects on young people, who may feel pressured to conform to unrealistic beauty standards or pursue fleeting fame rather than focusing on more meaningful pursuits.In conclusion, while the media's focus on celebrity lives may provide entertainment and escapism for some, its disadvantages far outweigh its advantages. By promoting a culture of misinformation, distraction, and misplaced values, the media's obsession with celebrity lives undermines its responsibility to inform and engage the public on the issues that truly matter. It is time for the media to reassess its priorities and focus on reporting that truly serves the public interest.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;"As a lover of travel, I always believe that visiting an excellent museum is the highlight of any tour. Museums are more than just repositories of artifacts; they are windows into the soul of a city, offering a glimpse into its rich history, culture, and traditions.

176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we learn, making it possible to study from the comfort of our own homes. While this convenience is undeniable, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations and potential drawbacks of relying solely on technology for education. Distance education courses, which utilize digital platforms to deliver instruction, can be particularly challenging to complete without the structure and social interaction of a traditional classroom setting.One of the primary advantages of traditional schooling is the opportunity for socialization. In a classroom, students are surrounded by their peers and instructors, allowing for the establishment of meaningful relationships and the development of essential communication skills. These interactions are vital for learning how to navigate different personalities, resolve conflicts, and work collaboratively towards a common goal. Unfortunately, computers and televisions, no matter how advanced, are incapable of replicating these human interactions.In a distance education setting, students often lack the face-to-face interactions that are so critical for social and emotional growth. Without the guidance of teachers and the support of classmates, it can be difficult for students to stay motivated and engaged in their coursework. Furthermore, the absence of social interaction can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection, ultimately hindering the learning process.While technology has certainly increased accessibility to education, it is essential to recognize the importance of human interaction in the learning process. Traditional schooling offers a unique blend of academic instruction and socialization, which is difficult to replicate in a distance education setting. As we move forward in this digital age, it is crucial that we find ways to balance the convenience of technology with the importance of human connection, ensuring that students receive a well-rounded education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;The Establishment of a Large Shopping Center: A Convenient and Cost-Effective Solution for ResidentsThe establishment of a large shopping center is a development that is likely to bring numerous benefits to residents in the area. One of the primary advantages of such a center is the convenience it offers to shoppers. With a vast array of stores and services under one roof, residents will no longer have to travel to multiple locations to fulfill their shopping needs. This not only saves time but also reduces the hassle of navigating through heavy traffic and finding parking spaces.Another significant advantage of a large shopping center is the potential for lower prices. With numerous retailers operating in close proximity, competition is likely to drive prices down, making it more affordable for residents to purchase the goods they need. This is particularly beneficial for those on a tight budget, as they can now access a wide range of products at prices that are more manageable. Furthermore, the convenience of having multiple stores in one location also saves residents time, which they can utilize for other important activities.In addition to the individual benefits, a large shopping center can also have a positive impact on the local economy. By providing a central location for shopping, it can help to boost sales for retailers, which in turn can lead to job creation and economic growth. Moreover, the increased foot traffic can also lead to the development of other supporting businesses, such as restaurants and cafes, further enhancing the overall shopping experience.In conclusion, the establishment of a large shopping center is a development that is likely to bring numerous benefits to residents. From providing a convenient and time-saving shopping experience to offering lower prices and boosting the local economy, it is a solution that can greatly enhance the quality of life for those living in the area.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";The Frenetic Pace of Life: Understanding Stress and its ImpactIn today's fast-paced world, stress has become an ubiquitous companion for people of all ages. It is our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, whether physical, emotional, or mental. Stress is often viewed as a negative phenomenon, but it can be caused by both good and bad experiences. For instance, getting married, having a child, or landing a dream job can be stressful, yet exhilarating experiences. On the other hand, the pressure to meet deadlines, financial struggles, or the loss of a loved one can also trigger stress.The consequences of chronic stress can be far-reaching and debilitating. Prolonged exposure to stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline can lead to a weakened immune system, cardiovascular disease, and mental health issues like depression and anxiety. In fact, stress is a major contributor to depression, with many people experiencing feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, and despair.The statistics are alarming. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stress is one of the leading causes of depression, with over 300 million people worldwide suffering from the condition. Moreover, stress affects not only individuals but also their loved ones, colleagues, and communities, perpetuating a cycle of negativity and distress.Breaking this cycle requires a multifaceted approach. Individuals can adopt stress-reducing techniques like meditation, yoga, and deep breathing exercises. Employers can foster a healthy work-life balance by offering flexible working hours, employee wellness programs, and mental health resources. Governments and healthcare systems can also play a crucial role by promoting mental health awareness, providing accessible mental health services, and encouraging research into the causes and consequences of stress.In conclusion, stress is an inherent part of our lives, but it is essential to recognize its impact on our mental and physical well-being. By understanding the causes and consequences of stress and taking proactive steps to manage it, we can mitigate its effects and create a healthier, happier world for ourselves and those around us.
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";Groups and organizations are a fundamental part of human society, providing individuals with a platform to gain invaluable experiences, achieve personal goals, and foster personal growth. These collective entities play a pivotal role in the socialization process, transcending age boundaries and impacting individuals from childhood to adulthood. A well-structured group environment offers a unique setting where individuals can improve themselves, broaden their horizons, and develop essential life skills.From a young age, children participate in various groups such as sports teams, scouting organizations, and school clubs. These early interactions lay the groundwork for socialization, teaching children vital skills like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. As individuals progress into adulthood, groups continue to play a crucial role in their development. Professional organizations, community groups, and social clubs provide opportunities for networking, skill enhancement, and personal growth.A solid group can be a transformative environment, allowing individuals to push beyond their comfort zones and explore new interests. Group dynamics encourage collaboration, creativity, and innovation, enabling members to tackle challenges and achieve collective goals. Moreover, groups offer a sense of belonging and support, which is essential for emotional well-being and motivation. Individuals can share experiences, receive feedback, and learn from one another, fostering a culture of mutual growth and development.In conclusion, groups and organizations are indispensable components of human society, providing a fertile ground for personal growth, skill development, and socialization. By participating in these collective entities, individuals can gain valuable experiences, achieve their objectives, and evolve as individuals. As such, it is imperative to recognize the significance of groups and organizations in shaping our lives and to actively engage with them to reap their numerous benefits.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;The government's plan to build a new university in our community has sparked a mix of excitement and concern among residents. On one hand, the establishment of a university is expected to bring numerous benefits to the community, particularly in terms of educational opportunities.The most significant advantage of having a university in our community is that it will provide more opportunities for people to pursue their studies. Many students in our community have to travel to other towns or cities to access higher education, which can be costly and inconvenient. With a university located in our community, students will have easier access to quality education, which will enable them to acquire skills and knowledge that will enhance their employability and contribute to the development of our community.Moreover, the university is likely to attract more businesses, services, and infrastructure to our community, which will create jobs and stimulate economic growth. This, in turn, will improve the overall quality of life for residents, making our community a more desirable place to live and work.However, the establishment of a university also comes with some disadvantages. One of the social problems that may arise is an increase in noise, traffic, and other disturbances that often come with a large student population. This may lead to conflicts between students and long-time residents, particularly if there is a perception that the university is disrupting the peaceful nature of our community.Additionally, there may be concerns about the impact of the university on local housing and amenities, as an influx of students may lead to increased demand for accommodation and services, potentially pricing out low-income residents.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the impact of the university on our community, the potential benefits in terms of educational opportunities and economic growth outweigh the disadvantages.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";The issue of whether the government should cover college tuition and expenses for its citizens has sparked intense debate. While some people argue that the government should bear the cost of college education, I firmly believe that individuals should be responsible for paying their own college tuition.First and foremost, providing free college education to all citizens would be a monumental financial burden on the government. The cost of covering tuition and expenses for millions of students would be staggering, and would likely require significant increases in taxes. This would not only be a financial strain on the government, but also on individual taxpayers who would have to foot the bill. It is already a struggle for many families to make ends meet, and raising taxes again and again to fund college education would only exacerbate this problem.Furthermore, I believe that college education is a personal choice. Not everyone chooses to attend college, and those who do should be responsible for their own educational expenses. If individuals are not invested in their own education, they may not take their studies seriously, and may not appreciate the value of their education. By paying for their own tuition, individuals have a vested interest in their education and are more likely to work hard and make the most of their college experience.Additionally, making college education free would create a culture of entitlement, where individuals expect everything to be provided for them without putting in any effort. This would undermine the value of hard work and personal responsibility, which are essential for success in life.In conclusion, while providing free college education may seem like an attractive idea, it is not a feasible or responsible solution. Individuals should be responsible for paying their own college tuition, as it is a personal choice and a valuable investment in their future. By doing so, we can promote a culture of hard work, personal responsibility, and self-reliance, which are essential for individual and societal success.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";The Impact of Television on Communication and Child DevelopmentTelevision has become an integral part of modern life, offering numerous benefits that make it a staple in many households. It provides a means of relaxation, allowing viewers to unwind and escape from the stresses of everyday life. Additionally, TV keeps us informed about current events and news, helping us stay up-to-date on what's happening around the world. Furthermore, it broadens our minds by exposing us to different cultures, ideas, and perspectives.However, despite these benefits, there is a growing concern that television has had a negative impact on communication among friends and family. With the constant availability of TV, people are spending more time watching screens and less time interacting with each other. This can lead to a breakdown in relationships, as individuals substitute face-to-face communication with solitary TV watching. Moreover, the ease of access to TV can also lead to a sedentary lifestyle, where people prefer to stay home and watch TV rather than engaging in social activities.Another worrying aspect of TV's influence is its impact on child development. Children often learn behavior by observing what they see on TV, rather than from their parents or caregivers. This can lead to the adoption of negative habits, such as violence, aggression, or materialism, which can have long-lasting effects on their social and emotional well-being. Furthermore, excessive TV watching can also hinder children's cognitive development, as it can distract them from more stimulating activities, such as reading, playing, or exploring their surroundings.In conclusion, while television offers many benefits, its impact on communication and child development cannot be ignored. It is essential for parents, caregivers, and individuals to be aware of these effects and take steps to mitigate them. By striking a balance between TV watching and social interaction, and by monitoring the content that children watch, we can ensure that television remains a positive influence in our lives.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life.";Attending a Live Football Match: A Unparalleled Experience for True FansFor die-hard football enthusiasts, particularly those who bleed the colors of their home team, nothing compares to the electric atmosphere of watching a live match at the stadium. The thrill of cheering on your beloved team alongside thousands of fellow fans is an experience that far surpasses watching the game alone at home. In this essay, we will explore why attending a live football match is a more gratifying experience than watching it from the comfort of one's own home.First and foremost, attending a live football match is an incredibly fulfilling experience. Imagine watching your favorite football stars in action, with your own eyes, as they battle it out on the pitch. The energy in the stadium is palpable, with approximately 40,000 fans sharing in the excitement and emotion of the game. The collective cheers, chants, and gasps of the crowd create an infectious atmosphere that amplifies the viewing experience. Unlike watching the game alone at home, where the excitement is often muted, a live match allows fans to feed off the energy of those around them, creating a truly immersive experience.While the tickets to get into the stadium may be a little expensive, the entertainment value gained from the game far outweighs the cost. Not only do fans get to witness their heroes in action, but they also become an integral part of the game, influencing the players and the overall outcome. The sense of community and camaraderie among fans, all united in their support for their team, is a unique and special aspect of attending a live match. In conclusion, for true football fans, attending a live match at the stadium is an unparalleled experience that offers a depth of excitement and entertainment that cannot be replicated in a home viewing setting.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power, have become integral components of the world's current and future energy strategy. However, in my opinion, these new forms of energy cannot yet supplant fossil fuels as the primary source of energy. Despite their numerous benefits, renewable energy sources face significant limitations that hinder their widespread adoption.One of the primary obstacles is the current state of technology. While advancements have been made in harnessing renewable energy, the technology is still relatively expensive compared to traditional fossil fuels. The cost of solar panels, wind turbines, and other equipment required to generate renewable energy is prohibitively high for many individuals and businesses. This makes it challenging for renewable energy to compete with the cheap, yet polluting, fossil fuels.Furthermore, renewable energy sources are intermittent, meaning they are not always available when they are needed. Solar energy, for example, is not generated during periods of low sunlight, and wind energy is not produced during calm weather. This intermittency requires the development of energy storage systems, which adds to the overall cost of renewable energy. In contrast, fossil fuels can be easily stored and transported, making them a more reliable source of energy.Another limitation of renewable energy is its geographical dependence. Solar energy, for instance, is more viable in regions with high sunlight exposure, while wind energy is more suitable in areas with strong and consistent wind patterns. This geographical constraint restricts the widespread adoption of renewable energy, particularly in regions with limited natural resources.While renewable energy sources hold great promise, they cannot yet fully replace fossil fuels due to technological limitations and high costs. Nevertheless, ongoing research and development are expected to improve the efficiency and affordability of renewable energy technologies, gradually increasing their share in the global energy mix.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;The prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry supersede the imperative to save land for endangered animals is a contentious issue. Proponents of this view argue that the benefits of utilizing land for agricultural, real estate, and industrial purposes outweigh the importance of preserving habitats for endangered species. This perspective is rooted in two primary aspects.Firstly, it is contended that land dedicated to agriculture, housing, and industry yields greater benefits to society as a whole. Farmland provides food security, ensuring that the population has access to staple crops and sustenance. Similarly, the real estate industry and industrial sectors contribute significantly to the economy, generating revenue and stimulating growth. These tangible benefits are often perceived as more pressing than the abstract notion of conserving land for endangered animals.Secondly, the expansion of farmlands and industries is seen as a panacea for unemployment and crime rates. By creating more job opportunities, these sectors can absorb a significant portion of the workforce, thereby decreasing the number of unemployed individuals. This, in turn, is believed to lead to a reduction in crime rates, as individuals with stable employment are less likely to engage in illicit activities. In contrast, setting aside land for endangered species is often viewed as a luxury that societies cannot afford, particularly in regions grappling with poverty and unemployment.While this perspective is understandable, it is essential to acknowledge the long-term consequences of prioritizing human needs over environmental concerns. The loss of biodiversity and ecosystems can have far-reaching and devastating effects on the planet, ultimately jeopardizing human well-being. As such, it is crucial to strike a balance between meeting human needs and preserving the natural world, lest we compromise the very foundations of our existence.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;The age-old debate surrounding language acquisition has sparked intense discussion among linguists and educators alike. One pivotal factor that significantly influences language learning is the environment in which it takes place. Those who embark on learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken tend to develop a more profound understanding of various language skills compared to their counterparts who learn the same language in their native country.This disparity can be attributed to the immersive nature of learning a language in its natural habitat. Surrounded by native speakers, learners are constantly exposed to the language in its authentic form, allowing them to pick up nuances and subtleties that may be lost in a traditional classroom setting. They are able to engage in conversations, listen to various accents, and comprehend the language in context, thereby refining their listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills.On the other hand, learners like person A, who opt to learn a non-native language in their home country, may benefit from a more structured approach. A step-by-step teaching method can provide a sense of comfort and familiarity, as it allows learners to gradually build their language foundation. This approach can be particularly helpful for those who are new to language learning or require additional support.Moreover, learners who study a foreign language in their own country often rely on language learning materials and instructional guidance, which may not fully capture the complexities and idiomatic expressions of the target language. In contrast, learners immersed in the language environment can absorb the language organically, developing a more sophisticated understanding of its various facets.In conclusion, the environment in which language learning takes place plays a crucial role in shaping one's language skills. While structured teaching methods can be beneficial for learners like person A, those who learn a foreign language in the country where it is spoken are likely to develop a deeper understanding of the language, reaping the rewards of authentic language exposure.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";"Exercise is often touted as a key component of a healthy lifestyle, and for good reason. Regular physical activity has been shown to have numerous benefits for the body, from weight management to improved cardiovascular health. However, the benefits of exercise extend far beyond the physical realm. In fact, exercise has been shown to have a profound impact on mental health and cognitive function, particularly in children.Research has consistently demonstrated that daily exercise can improve brain function in children, leading to enhanced focus, concentration, and academic performance. Physical activity has even been shown to promote the growth of new neurons in the brain, a process known as neurogenesis. This can have long-term benefits for children's cognitive development, leading to improved memory, problem-solving skills, and overall academic achievement.In addition to the physical and cognitive benefits, incorporating daily exercise into a child's routine can also teach them valuable lessons about the importance of physical activity. By starting early, children can develop healthy habits that will last a lifetime, and understand the value of prioritizing physical activity in their daily routine. This can lead to a range of benefits, from improved self-esteem to enhanced overall well-being.Incorporating exercise into a child's daily routine can be as simple as encouraging them to participate in sports, joining them in physical activities, or even just playing active games together. By doing so, parents and caregivers can give children the gift of a healthy body and mind, setting them up for a lifetime of physical and cognitive well-being. As the old adage goes, ""a healthy body and mind are the greatest wealth one can possess."" By prioritizing exercise and physical activity, we can give children the tools they need to succeed in all aspects of life."
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;Title: The Pitfalls of Teenagers Holding Jobs while StudyingIn today's fast-paced world, many teenagers are opting to juggle school with part-time jobs. While this may seem like a great way to gain work experience and earn some extra pocket money, I strongly believe that it is not a good idea for teenagers to have jobs while they are still students. This arrangement can interfere with their life in various ways, ultimately affecting their overall well-being and academic performance.One of the most significant drawbacks of teenagers having jobs is the impact it has on their health. Working and studying simultaneously can lead to excessive stress, which can result in fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Teenagers need adequate sleep, nutrition, and exercise to maintain their physical and mental health, which can be compromised when they are working part-time. Furthermore, the pressure to balance work and school responsibilities can lead to burnout, causing them to neglect their health and well-being.Having a job can also divert a teenager's mind from their studies. With a part-time job, they may have to dedicate a significant amount of time to their work, leaving them with limited time and energy to focus on their studies. This can lead to poor academic performance, which can have long-term consequences on their future career prospects. Additionally, a job can also distract them from extracurricular activities and hobbies, which are essential for their overall development and well-being.Lastly, having a job can take away the carefree childhood phase from a teenager's life. Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for growth, exploration, and self-discovery. Working part-time can rob them of the opportunity to enjoy their teenage years, explore their interests, and develop essential life skills.In conclusion, while having a part-time job may seem like a great way for teenagers to earn money and gain work experience, it can have far-reaching consequences on their health, academic performance, and overall well-being. It is essential for teenagers to focus on their studies and enjoy their childhood, rather than juggling work and school responsibilities.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;The establishment of zoos has been a longstanding practice across the globe, attracting millions of visitors annually. On one hand, many people view zoos as an entertaining and educational outlet for the masses. These institutions offer a platform for individuals to observe and learn about various animal species from around the world, some of which are endangered or rare.On the other hand, there is an ongoing debate about the ethics of keeping animals in captivity. Many critics argue that zoos are, in fact, a form of imprisonment for animals, stripping them of their natural habitats and freedom.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;**The Benefits of Studying in a Group**As a student, I have always found that studying in a group of friends is not only enjoyable, but also highly beneficial for my academic success. In fact, I strongly prefer this method of learning over individual study, as it offers numerous opportunities for growth and improvement. One of the most significant advantages of studying in a group is the ability to receive help from my peers. When we gather together to study, we can share our knowledge and expertise, filling in the gaps in each other's understanding. If I am struggling with a particular concept, my friends can explain it to me in a way that is easy to grasp, and vice versa.Another benefit of studying in a group is the improvement of my learning skills. When we work together, we can discuss different approaches to problems, and learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. This collaborative learning environment helps me to stay motivated and focused, as we encourage and support each other in our academic pursuits. Additionally, studying in a group helps me to develop important skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are essential in many areas of life.Furthermore, studying in a group also provides an opportunity for us to test each other's knowledge and understanding, which helps to identify areas where we need to focus our efforts. We can also engage in peer-to-peer teaching, which not only reinforces our own understanding but also helps others to learn. In conclusion, studying in a group of friends offers numerous benefits, from receiving help from others to improving my learning skills. It is a fun and effective way to learn, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their academic experience.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;The Value of Friendship: A Matter of PreferenceFriendship is undoubtedly one of the most significant values in a person's life, providing emotional support, companionship, and a sense of belonging. Despite its importance, people often have varying preferences when it comes to the type of friendships they maintain. Some prefer to have a small, close-knit group of friends, while others enjoy staying in contact with a large number of acquaintances. In my opinion, the latter approach is more beneficial, as it offers the opportunity to learn from others' experiences and broaden one's perspective.Having a large number of friends allows individuals to be exposed to diverse backgrounds, cultures, and ways of thinking. This diversity can enrich one's life by providing access to a wide range of experiences, knowledge, and skills. By staying in contact with many people, one can gain insights into different industries, hobbies, and interests, which can be invaluable in both personal and professional life. Moreover, having many friends can also lead to a stronger support network, as there is always someone available to offer advice, encouragement, or a helping hand.On the other hand, having a small group of close friends can also have its advantages, such as deeper, more meaningful relationships. However, I believe that this approach can be limiting, as it may not provide the same level of exposure to new ideas and experiences that a larger social circle can offer. In today's fast-paced, interconnected world, having a broad network of friends can be particularly beneficial, as it allows individuals to stay adaptable and open to new opportunities.In conclusion, while people may have different preferences when it comes to friendship, I firmly believe that staying in contact with a large number of friends is the more advantageous approach. By doing so, one can broaden their horizons, gain new insights, and develop a stronger support network.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The use of public transportation is a crucial step towards conserving our natural resources, which are gradually running out. As the world's population continues to grow, the demand for transportation increases, leading to a surge in the number of private cars on the road. However, this trend is not sustainable, as it contributes to the depletion of our natural resources and exacerbates environmental problems.In contrast, public transportation offers a viable solution to these issues. By using buses, trains, and subways, we can significantly reduce the number of private cars on the road, resulting in lower oil and gasoline consumption per person. This, in turn, leads to a decrease in air pollution, which is a major contributor to climate change. The more cars that are driven, the more pollutants are released into the atmosphere, making the Earth warmer and accelerating global warming.On the other hand, using public transportation not only benefits the environment, but also fosters a sense of community and social interaction. When people use public transportation, they are more likely to interact with others, creating a sense of camaraderie and social connection. This is in stark contrast to the isolation that often comes with driving a private car. By using public transportation, we can live more sociably, building relationships and connections with those around us.In conclusion, the use of public transportation is a simple yet effective way to conserve our natural resources and reduce our carbon footprint. By opting for buses, trains, and subways, we can significantly reduce our reliance on oil and gasoline, decrease air pollution, and create a more sociable and connected community. As we move forward, it is essential that we prioritize the use of public transportation to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;The debate over the role of zoos in animal conservation has been ongoing for years. While some people argue that zoos are a great asset to animals, providing a safe and controlled environment for them to thrive, others believe that animals are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. However, in my opinion, the welfare of animals should be our top priority, and we must strive to help them live safely and comfortably in their own natural environment.First and foremost, animals are not inferior creatures, but rather living beings that deserve our respect and care. They have complex social structures, emotions, and needs, just like humans do. It is our responsibility to ensure that their needs are met, and that they are treated with dignity and compassion. Keeping animals in zoos, no matter how spacious or well-designed, can never replicate the freedom and autonomy they would experience in their natural habitats.Moreover, zoos can be detrimental to animal welfare. Many animals in zoos suffer from stress, boredom, and behavioral problems due to the lack of space and stimulation. For example, elephants in zoos often develop foot problems and exhibit abnormal behaviors such as pacing and self-mutilation. In contrast, animals in their natural habitats are able to roam free, forage, and interact with their social groups, which is essential for their physical and mental well-being.Rather than keeping animals in zoos, we should focus on conservation efforts that protect and restore their natural habitats. This can involve supporting organizations that work to preserve and expand wildlife reserves, as well as promoting sustainable land-use practices that minimize human-wildlife conflict. By taking these steps, we can help ensure that animals are able to live safely and comfortably in their own environment, without the need for human intervention.In conclusion, while some people may view zoos as a necessary evil, I firmly believe that our priority should be to help animals thrive in their natural habitats. By working towards this goal, we can ensure that animals receive the respect, care, and dignity they deserve.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;If a university were to establish a new research center in my country, I would strongly advocate for the creation of a center for agriculture research. This decision is driven by the vast potential of agriculture to transform the lives of my fellow citizens and significantly contribute to the country's economic growth.First and foremost, a center for agriculture research would enable my country to better harness the potential of its land. Agriculture is a cornerstone of many economies, providing the foundation for food security and serving as a vital source of income for countless individuals and families. By conducting research in this area, the center would facilitate the discovery of innovative farming practices, improved crop varieties, and more efficient irrigation systems. This would, in turn, lead to increased agricultural productivity, allowing my country to make the most of its fertile lands and ensure a stable food supply.Moreover, a center for agriculture research would play a pivotal role in bolstering my country's economy. As it stands, the agricultural sector accounts for a mere thirty percent of the market share, indicating a vast scope for expansion and growth. By investing in research that addresses the challenges facing the agricultural industry, the center would help unlock the sector's full potential, paving the way for increased economic activity, job creation, and ultimately, a stronger economy. This, in turn, would have a positive ripple effect on other sectors, as a thriving agricultural industry would provide a stable foundation for the overall growth and development of my country.In conclusion, the establishment of a center for agriculture research would be a strategic move, offering numerous benefits for my country's citizens and economy. By prioritizing agricultural research, we can unlock the sector's vast potential, drive economic growth, and ensure a brighter future for generations to come.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;Throughout our lives, we encounter a multitude of experiences and opportunities for growth. One of the most effective ways to acquire knowledge and develop new skills is through hands-on experience. I firmly believe that learning by doing, rather than solely through reading or listening, is the most beneficial approach to personal development.When we take on tasks and challenges independently, we are forced to rely on our own abilities and judgment. This self-reliance is a crucial aspect of maturity, as it enables us to make informed decisions, think critically, and solve problems effectively. By doing things on our own, we learn to trust ourselves and our capabilities, which in turn boosts our confidence and self-esteem.Furthermore, learning by doing allows us to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter at hand. When we simply read about or listen to others discuss a topic, we may grasp the theoretical concepts, but we lack the practical application and real-world experience. By actively engaging in the learning process, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of the material, which can be applied in various situations.In addition, learning by doing fosters a sense of responsibility and accountability. When we take ownership of our actions and decisions, we are more likely to be invested in the outcome and motivated to achieve success. This mindset is essential for personal growth and development, as it encourages us to push beyond our comfort zones and strive for excellence.In conclusion, learning by doing is an invaluable approach to acquiring knowledge and developing skills. By taking on challenges and tasks independently, we cultivate self-reliance, maturity, and a deeper understanding of the world around us. As we continue to navigate the complexities of life, it is essential that we prioritize hands-on learning experiences, embracing the opportunities they provide for growth and self-improvement.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap air fares has revolutionized the way people travel, making it more accessible to a wider audience, particularly those from lower income groups. With the rise of budget airlines and online booking platforms, air travel has become more affordable and convenient. This has opened up new possibilities for people who were previously unable to travel by air due to financial constraints.The impact of cheap air fares on the environment, however, is a different story altogether. The rapid growth of the aviation industry has led to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide, which is released into the atmosphere through the burning of plane fuel. This contributes to global warming, a pressing issue that threatens the health of our planet.As air travel becomes more accessible, the demand for flights increases, leading to more planes in the sky and more emissions. According to a recent report, the aviation industry accounts for around 2.5% of global carbon emissions, a significant contribution to the overall problem of climate change. Furthermore, the contrails produced by airplanes can also trap heat in the atmosphere, exacerbating the problem.In conclusion, while cheap air fares have certainly broadened travel possibilities for many people, the negative impact on the environment cannot be ignored. It is imperative that the aviation industry takes steps to mitigate its environmental impact, such as investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft and developing sustainable aviation fuels.
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;The rise in the number of private cars on the road has led to a multitude of problems that governments must address. One effective solution to these issues is investing in the public transportation system. By allocating funds to public transportation, governments can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of a growing number of private vehicles.First and foremost, the utilization of public transportation significantly reduces the amount of resources expended on transportation. With more people opting for buses, trains, and subways, the demand for fuel and maintenance for individual vehicles decreases. This, in turn, leads to a more efficient allocation of resources, as the same amount of fuel and maintenance can transport a larger number of people. Furthermore, a robust public transportation system encourages people to abandon their private vehicles, resulting in a reduction in the number of cars on the road.Secondly, public transportation plays a vital role in solving air pollution problems. Private cars emit significant amounts of pollutants, contributing to poor air quality and exacerbating respiratory issues. In contrast, public transportation vehicles can be designed to be more environmentally friendly, producing fewer emissions per passenger. By promoting the use of public transportation, governments can decrease the overall emissions from the transportation sector, leading to cleaner air and a healthier environment.In addition to these benefits, public transportation is also remarkably safer than private cars. According to the National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than driving a private car. This staggering statistic highlights the importance of investing in public transportation, as it not only reduces the number of accidents but also saves lives.In conclusion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system to deal with the problems created by the rising number of private cars. By reducing resource usage, mitigating air pollution, and ensuring safety, public transportation offers a multitude of benefits that make it an essential investment for the well-being of citizens and the environment.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;The debate over whether students should study individually or in groups has long been a contentious issue. While some students reap significant benefits from collaborative learning, I firmly believe that studying individually is the most effective way to learn and grow. For me, the primary advantage of individual study is the ability to concentrate more intently on the material.When studying in a group, distractions and social interactions can often hinder focus and productivity. In contrast, studying alone allows me to create a conducive learning environment, free from interruptions and peer pressure. This enables me to delve deeper into the subject matter, absorb information more efficiently, and retain it better.Moreover, studying individually plays a crucial role in shaping our personalities and character traits. When we work on assignments and projects independently, we develop a sense of responsibility and accountability. By relying solely on ourselves to complete tasks, we build confidence and self-reliance, essential qualities for success in all aspects of life. For instance, answering homework questions on our own encourages us to think critically, research thoroughly, and solve problems autonomously. These skills are invaluable in both academic and professional settings, where independence and self-motivation are highly valued.In conclusion, while group study may be beneficial for some, I firmly believe that individual study is the most effective way to learn and grow. By studying alone, I can concentrate more effectively, develop a sense of responsibility, and build a stronger, more independent personality. As students, it is essential to recognize the value of individual study and make the most of this opportunity to cultivate the skills and qualities necessary for success in our academic and professional pursuits.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";The Earth's environment is facing a grave crisis due to the reckless activities of human beings. The excessive pollution, depletion of natural resources, and endangerment of other species have raised serious concerns about the sustainability of life on our planet. The rampant industrialization and consumerism have led to the exhaustion of natural resources such as oil, coal, and water. The exploitation of these resources has resulted in the degradation of ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, and disruption of the delicate balance of nature. Furthermore, the pollution of air, water, and soil has reached alarming levels, posing a significant threat to the health and well-being of both humans and wildlife. The reckless use of fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, has not only led to the depletion of these resources but also contributed to climate change, which is having far-reaching consequences on the environment. The impact of human activities on other species is equally devastating. The destruction of habitats, pollution, and hunting have pushed many species to the brink of extinction. The consequences of such actions are far-reaching and can have a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, leading to the collapse of entire food chains. It is imperative that we take immediate action to mitigate the damage that has been done. This can be achieved by adopting sustainable practices, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, and conserving natural resources. Moreover, it is essential that we prioritize the protection of other species and their habitats to preserve the delicate balance of nature. The future of our planet depends on our ability to take responsibility for our actions and work towards a more sustainable and environmentally conscious world.
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";"The world's ecosystem is at a critical juncture. With the relentless pursuit of economic growth and development, the environment has been pushed to the brink of collapse. The stark reality is that the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever, with climate change, deforestation, pollution, and species extinction reaching alarming levels. The window for taking drastic measures to mitigate this catastrophe is rapidly closing, and if we fail to act now, the consequences will be irreversible.In this context, supporting environmental protection has emerged as a crucial method of advertising. Consumers are increasingly environmentally conscious, and companies that prioritize sustainability and eco-friendliness are reaping the benefits. By embracing eco-friendly practices and promoting environmentally responsible products, businesses can not only contribute to the preservation of the planet but also enhance their brand reputation and appeal to a growing market of eco-conscious consumers.Moreover, conservation efforts have been proven to lead to a higher standard of living. By preserving natural habitats and ecosystems, we can ensure the continued provision of essential services such as clean air and water, healthy soil, and climate regulation. This, in turn, has a direct impact on human well-being, with studies showing that communities that prioritize conservation tend to have better health outcomes, improved food security, and increased economic opportunities.The urgency of the environmental crisis demands that we adopt a multifaceted approach to address the issue. Governments, corporations, and individuals must work in tandem to implement sustainable practices, reduce waste, and invest in renewable energy sources. The time for half-measures is over; we need drastic, collective action to prevent the irreparable damage to our planet. By supporting environmental protection and prioritizing conservation, we can not only ensure a livable future but also create a better standard of living for generations to come."
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;In today's fast-paced work environment, having a good co-worker is essential for the success and harmony of any team. A good co-worker is one who possesses certain key characteristics that enable them to work effectively with others, leading to increased productivity and a positive work atmosphere. Among these, cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship stand out as the most important qualities.Firstly, cooperation is the foundation of a good working relationship. When co-workers cooperate, they share the workload, ideas, and expertise, leading to more efficient and effective outcomes. Without cooperation, there will be lots of disputes, delays, and missed deadlines. A cooperative co-worker is willing to lend a hand, listen to others' opinions, and compromise when necessary, creating a cohesive and productive team environment.Secondly, trustworthiness is crucial in building strong working relationships. A trustworthy co-worker is reliable, honest, and transparent, keeping their word and maintaining confidentiality when necessary. When team members trust each other, they feel secure in sharing their ideas, concerns, and feedback, leading to open communication and constructive feedback. This, in turn, fosters a culture of mutual respect and support.Lastly, fellowship is essential in creating a positive and inclusive work environment. A co-worker who demonstrates fellowship shows genuine interest in their colleagues' well-being, celebrates their successes, and offers support during challenging times. This helps to build a sense of camaraderie, reducing stress and anxiety, and promoting a sense of belonging among team members.In conclusion, a good co-worker is one who embodies cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship. These qualities are essential in creating a harmonious and productive work environment, where team members feel valued, supported, and motivated to achieve their best. By possessing these characteristics, a good co-worker can make a significant difference in the success and well-being of their team, and ultimately, the organization as a whole.
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;The Digital Age: Weighing the Pros and Cons of Online Computer ClassesThe digital age has revolutionized the way we learn, making online classes more accessible and appealing to the masses. As a result, the debate surrounding online computer classes replacing traditional classroom learning has gained momentum. While some argue that online classes offer greater flexibility and convenience, others believe that they lack the essential human interaction and hands-on experience that a physical classroom provides.On one hand, online computer classes offer a range of benefits. For instance, they provide students with the flexibility to learn at their own pace, anytime, and from any location. This is particularly beneficial for students who have work or family commitments, or those who live in remote areas with limited access to quality educational institutions. Additionally, online classes can cater to a larger number of students, making high-quality education more accessible to people worldwide.On the other hand, there are concerns that online classes may lack the essential human interaction and hands-on experience that a physical classroom provides. In a traditional classroom setting, students can engage in face-to-face discussions, ask questions, and receive immediate feedback from instructors. This type of interaction is crucial for building critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and social skills. Moreover, hands-on experience and lab work are essential for students to grasp complex computer concepts and develop practical skills.However, I believe that online computer classes should not replace traditional classroom learning entirely. Instead, they should be used as a supplement to traditional learning, offering students the flexibility and convenience to learn at their own pace, while also providing them with the opportunity to engage in face-to-face discussions and hands-on experience in a physical classroom. By striking a balance between online and traditional learning, we can create a more inclusive, effective, and engaging learning environment that caters to the diverse needs of students in the digital age.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The notion that students should be free to miss classes is often met with skepticism, with many believing that regular attendance is crucial for academic success. However, this essay will argue that granting students the freedom to choose when they attend classes can have a profoundly positive impact on the quality of their student life, learning motivation, and the development of important life skills. Furthermore, this flexibility can greatly enhance their overall academic experience.First and foremost, allowing students to miss classes when they see fit can significantly improve the quality of their student life. By not being bound to a rigid schedule, students can take breaks when they need to recharge, thereby avoiding burnout and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. This, in turn, can lead to improved mental and physical well-being, which are essential for academic performance. Moreover, having the autonomy to choose when they attend classes can boost students' morale and overall satisfaction with their academic experience.Moreover, giving students the freedom to miss classes can actually enhance their learning motivation. When students feel forced to attend classes, they can develop a negative attitude towards learning, leading to disengagement and a lack of motivation. On the other hand, when students have the freedom to choose when they attend classes, they are more likely to attend classes that genuinely interest them, leading to increased engagement and motivation. This, in turn, can lead to better academic outcomes, as students are more invested in their learning.In addition to improving student life and learning motivation, allowing students to miss classes can also teach them important life skills, such as time management and prioritization. When students have the freedom to choose when they attend classes, they must learn to prioritize their tasks, manage their time effectively, and make decisions about how to allocate their time. These skills are essential in all areas of life, and by granting students the autonomy to make choices about their attendance, we are giving them the opportunity to develop these skills.Lastly, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility. In today's fast-paced, ever-changing world, adaptability is key. By giving students the freedom to choose when they attend classes, we are teaching them to be flexible and adapt to changing circumstances. This skill will serve them well in all areas of life, from their future careers to their personal lives.In conclusion, granting students the freedom to choose when they attend classes can have a profoundly positive impact on the quality of their student life, learning motivation, and the development of important life skills. By giving students the autonomy to make choices about their attendance, we are teaching them essential life
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;Title: The Charm of Small Towns: Why I Prefer a Simpler Way of LifeAs the world continues to urbanize at a rapid pace, I often find myself yearning for a more tranquil and peaceful existence. For me, the ideal place to call home is a small town, where life is simpler, and the air is fresher. There are several advantages to living in a small town, which make it an attractive option for those seeking a healthier and more harmonious lifestyle.Firstly, small towns are often blessed with good weather, which is a significant factor in determining one's overall well-being. The cleaner air, lesser pollution, and ample green spaces make it easier to lead a healthy life. In contrast, big cities are often plagued by smog, traffic congestion, and a general lack of greenery, which can be detrimental to one's health.Secondly, living costs in small towns are significantly lower compared to big cities. The cost of living is a major concern for people everywhere, and small towns offer a more affordable alternative. Housing, food, and transportation costs are lower, allowing individuals to live a more comfortable life without breaking the bank.Another significant advantage of small towns is the strong sense of community that exists among residents. In small towns, people know each other, and there is a greater sense of camaraderie and cooperation. Neighbors become like family, and locals often look out for one another. This is in stark contrast to big cities, where people often feel alone and disconnected from those around them. The anonymity of city life can be overwhelming, and the lack of human connection can lead to feelings of isolation and disorientation.In conclusion, small towns offer a unique blend of natural beauty, affordability, and community spirit that makes them an attractive option for those seeking a more peaceful and fulfilling life. While big cities have their own advantages, I firmly believe that the charms of small town living far outweigh the benefits of urban life.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;The recent surge in migration of young individuals from rural areas to urban centers has become a pressing concern. As people seek better job prospects and educational opportunities, they often find themselves trading off the tranquility of their countryside homes for the hustle and bustle of city life. However, this trend has far-reaching consequences that are often overlooked in the pursuit of progress.One of the primary reasons I disapprove of this trend is the significant impact it has on the quality of life. Urban environments are often characterized by overcrowding, noise pollution, and a fast-paced lifestyle that can be overwhelming for those who are not accustomed to it. Furthermore, the cost of living in cities is notoriously high, leading to financial strain and stress for many individuals. In contrast, rural areas offer a more peaceful and serene environment, where residents can enjoy a closer connection with nature and a stronger sense of community.Another critical aspect that I believe is often neglected is the environmental impact of urbanization. As cities expand, natural habitats are destroyed, and ecosystems are disrupted. This not only leads to loss of biodiversity but also exacerbates climate change. The strain on urban infrastructure, such as transportation systems and waste management, also contributes to environmental degradation.While the allure of cities may promise better opportunities, the long-term effects on individuals and the environment are too great to ignore. It is crucial that we prioritize sustainable development and explore alternatives that bring opportunities to rural areas, rather than encouraging the exodus of young people to cities. By doing so, we can preserve the beauty of our countryside and promote a better quality of life for all.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;In today's society, the economy has become the driving force behind our daily lives. As such, it is essential that individuals, particularly students, develop a solid understanding of economic principles at an early stage. The earlier one dives into the realm of economics, the more adept they will become in navigating the complexities of the modern economic landscape.Introducing basic economic courses at the high school level can have a profound impact on students' futures. Not only will it provide them with a foundation in economic concepts, but it will also equip them with the skills necessary to make informed decisions in their personal and professional lives. By learning about supply and demand, budgeting, and financial literacy, students will be better prepared to manage their own finances, invest wisely, and contribute to the overall economic growth of their communities.Moreover, having a basic understanding of economics will significantly benefit students when they transition to college. Many university programs, such as business, finance, and international relations, rely heavily on economic theories and principles. Students who have already been exposed to these concepts will have a distinct advantage over their peers, as they will be able to dive deeper into the subject matter and grasp more complex ideas. Furthermore, the analytical and critical thinking skills developed through studying economics will serve students well in a variety of academic pursuits, enabling them to approach problems from a unique and informed perspective.In conclusion, incorporating basic economic courses into high school curricula is a vital step in preparing students for success in today's economy-driven world. By introducing these concepts at an early stage, students will develop essential skills, gain a competitive edge in college, and ultimately, become more informed and active participants in the global economy.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The notion that only outstanding academic students are eligible for university admission is a long-standing debate. On one hand, it is argued that students with exceptional academic abilities are the most suited for higher education, as they possess an intellectual advantage that enables them to excel in their studies. This argument is based on the idea that university is primarily a place for academic pursuits, and that students who demonstrate a high level of academic achievement are best equipped to handle the demands of university-level coursework.However, this perspective overlooks the fact that university is not solely a place for academic studies, but also a platform for nurturing artistic talent and developing soft skills. Many universities offer programs and extracurricular activities that cater to students with diverse interests and strengths, including music, art, drama, and sports. These opportunities allow students to explore their passions, develop their creativity, and build their confidence, which are essential for personal growth and success.Moreover, the idea that only outstanding academic students should be eligible for university admission ignores the fact that academic achievement is not the only indicator of a student's potential. Many students who may not excel academically may possess other strengths, such as leadership skills, creativity, or a strong work ethic, that are valuable assets in the workplace and in life.In conclusion, the restriction of university admission to only outstanding academic students has both pros and cons. While it may ensure that only the most academically gifted students are admitted, it also limits opportunities for students who may excel in other areas. Ultimately, universities should consider a holistic approach to admissions, taking into account not only academic achievement, but also artistic talent, leadership potential, and other qualities that make a student a well-rounded individual.
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state has become an integral part of a government's responsibility towards its citizens. One of the key aspects of a welfare state is the provision of sustainable healthcare and health education. The primary objective of a welfare state is to ensure that its citizens have access to quality healthcare, which is essential for their overall well-being and productivity.However, the current approach to healthcare in many countries is focused more on treatment rather than prevention. A significant portion of the budget is allocated towards treating illnesses and diseases, rather than preventing them from occurring in the first place. This approach is not only costly but also inefficient. It is estimated that a substantial portion of healthcare expenditure is spent on treating preventable conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.On the other hand, investing in health education and prevention can have long-term benefits. Educating citizens on healthy lifestyles, nutrition, and disease prevention can significantly reduce the incidence of preventable diseases. Moreover, investing in preventive measures such as vaccinations, screening programs, and health check-ups can detect health problems early, reducing the need for costly treatments.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison to treatment. This approach not only saves costs in the long run but also improves the overall health and well-being of citizens. By prioritizing health education and prevention, governments can reduce the burden on the healthcare system, improve health outcomes, and create a healthier and more productive society. It is time for governments to reassess their priorities and invest in a more sustainable approach to healthcare, one that emphasizes prevention and education over treatment.
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;"The role of schools in a student's life extends far beyond the realm of academic subjects. While mathematics, science, and language are crucial for a student's intellectual development, non-academic subjects such as physical education, music, and art are equally essential for their overall growth. Physical education, in particular, plays a vital role in shaping a student's physical and mental well-being.If physical education were to be removed from the syllabus, the effects on students' health would be considerable. Regular exercise and physical activity have been proven to improve cardiovascular health, reduce obesity, and boost mental health. Without physical education, students would be more likely to lead sedentary lifestyles, leading to a range of health problems. Moreover, physical education teaches students important life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance, which are essential for success in all areas of life.Schools have a responsibility to develop their students into well-rounded individuals, equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in life. While academic knowledge is important, it is not the only factor that determines success. Practical life skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and time management, are equally important. Non-academic subjects provide students with opportunities to develop these skills, which are essential for navigating the challenges of everyday life.In conclusion, non-academic subjects, particularly physical education, are essential for a student's development. Schools have a responsibility to provide students with a balanced education that includes both academic and non-academic subjects. By doing so, they can equip students with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to succeed in life. Success in life requires more than just academic knowledge; it requires practical life skills, physical and mental well-being, and a well-rounded education."
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When people move to another country, they are often faced with the daunting task of adapting to a new culture. One of the most significant challenges they encounter is the choice between following the customs of their adopted country or clinging to their original ones. This dilemma can have a profound impact on their integration into the new society.On one hand, embracing the customs of the new country can greatly facilitate the assimilation process. By adopting local traditions and practices, immigrants can more easily navigate everyday life, form connections with their new community, and gain a deeper understanding of the culture. For instance, learning to celebrate national holidays and participating in local festivities can help them feel more at home and build bridges with their new neighbors. Furthermore, conforming to the customs of the new country can also improve their social and professional prospects, as they become more familiar with the local way of life.On the other hand, when people insist on retaining their original customs and resist adopting the new ones, they may inadvertently create a sense of segregation. By holding onto their traditional practices and refusing to adapt, they may be perceived as a distinct group, separate from the rest of the community. This can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion, making it more challenging for them to integrate into the new society. Moreover, this insistence on maintaining their cultural identity may be misinterpreted as a rejection of the host country's values and customs, potentially leading to misunderstandings and tensions.Ultimately, the decision to adopt the customs of the new country or retain one's original ones is a personal choice. However, it is essential to strike a balance between preserving one's cultural heritage and embracing the local way of life. By finding a middle ground, immigrants can navigate their new surroundings with greater ease, foster meaningful connections with their new community, and build a brighter future for themselves.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;The debate over the relative importance of working in teams versus working alone has been ongoing. While many argue that teamwork is essential for achieving success, I firmly believe that the ability to work alone is more significant. In today's competitive academic environment, individual performance plays a crucial role in determining one's future prospects.One of the primary reasons I advocate for the importance of working alone is that many assessments, such as standardized tests and final exams, do not allow for team collaboration. These tests are designed to evaluate an individual's knowledge, skills, and critical thinking abilities. Therefore, it is imperative that students learn to work independently and rely on their own strengths to excel in these assessments. By doing so, they can demonstrate their unique capabilities and showcase their potential to colleges and universities.Moreover, working alone enables individuals to develop a sense of personal responsibility and accountability. When students work on their own, they are more likely to take ownership of their work and strive for excellence. This mindset is essential for achieving brilliant accomplishments, such as acing school tests and gaining admission to top colleges. In contrast, when working in a team, individuals may rely on others to carry the workload, leading to a lack of personal growth and development.In conclusion, while teamwork has its benefits, I firmly believe that the ability to work alone is more significant in today's academic landscape. By learning to work independently, students can develop the skills and mindset necessary to excel in individual assessments and achieve brilliant accomplishments. As students strive to succeed in their academic pursuits, it is essential that they prioritize the development of their individual capabilities and learn to work effectively on their own.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";The Importance of Hobbies and Physical Activities in Maintaining a Healthy Work-Life BalanceIn today's fast-paced world, many people believe that focusing solely on one's job is the key to success. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. Engaging in hobbies and physical activities is, in my opinion, the best way to maintain a healthy work-life balance and overall well-being. Not only do these activities keep us physically fit, but they also provide a much-needed break from the monotony of daily routine.Doing the same thing for an extended period can be mentally exhausting and demotivating. This is where hobbies come into play. Pursuing activities outside of work can refresh our minds, challenge us in new ways, and provide a sense of accomplishment. Moreover, hobbies can be an excellent outlet for expressing emotions, especially when feeling depressed or pressured. For instance, playing a musical instrument can be a therapeutic way to channel emotions and clear one's mind.Furthermore, having hobbies can help prevent burnout and improve productivity in the long run. When we take breaks and engage in activities we enjoy, we return to our work with renewed energy and focus. This, in turn, can lead to better job performance and overall job satisfaction. In addition, hobbies can also provide opportunities to meet new people and build social connections, which are essential for our emotional and mental well-being.In conclusion, while having a fulfilling career is important, it is equally essential to prioritize hobbies and physical activities. By doing so, we can maintain a healthy work-life balance, reduce stress, and improve our overall quality of life.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;The world is facing a multitude of environmental and societal issues, with many countries grappling with pollution, noise, and casualties. In my opinion, one of the most effective solutions to these problems is improving roads and highways. This may seem like a simplistic solution, but it has far-reaching benefits that can address these issues on multiple fronts.Firstly, improving roads and highways can significantly reduce pollution. When roads are well-maintained and designed efficiently, traffic congestion is minimized, and vehicles do not have to spend as much time idling or traveling at low speeds. This reduces the amount of exhaust emissions released into the atmosphere, contributing less to air pollution. Additionally, better roads encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling or walking, which produce no emissions at all.Secondly, improved roads and highways can reduce noise pollution. When roads are designed with noise-reducing features, such as sound barriers or quieter road surfaces, the noise level is significantly decreased. This not only improves the quality of life for those living near highways but also reduces the negative impacts of noise pollution on mental and physical health.Thirdly, improving roads and highways can decrease the number of casualties. When roads are well-designed and well-maintained, the risk of accidents is greatly reduced. This is because good road design can reduce the number of conflict points, improve visibility, and provide better drainage, all of which contribute to a safer driving environment. Furthermore, improved roads encourage drivers to drive more safely, reducing the risk of accidents caused by reckless driving.In conclusion, improving roads and highways is a multifaceted solution to the problems of pollution, noise, and casualties. By reducing pollution, noise, and accidents, improved roads and highways can greatly improve the quality of life for citizens and contribute to a more sustainable future.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;The journey of life is a complex and winding path, full of twists and turns that can often leave us perplexed and uncertain. As we navigate this journey, there are two primary ways in which we can gain valuable insights and wisdom: by listening to the advice of family and friends, and by learning through personal experience. In my opinion, both methods have their own unique advantages, making them equally worthwhile.On one hand, seeking guidance from loved ones can provide a more practical and realistic approach to understanding life. Family and friends, having traversed similar paths, can offer sage advice and share their own experiences, allowing us to learn from their triumphs and setbacks. This approach can save us from making the same mistakes and expedite our learning process. Moreover, the advice of loved ones is often laced with empathy and concern, making it easier to digest and implement.On the other hand, learning through personal experience can be a more transformative and empowering approach. By venturing out and exploring life on our own terms, we can develop a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. Personal experience allows us to make our own mistakes, and in doing so, we can cultivate resilience, self-awareness, and problem-solving skills. While this approach can be more time-consuming and sometimes painful, the lessons learned are often more profound and long-lasting.In my opinion, learning through personal experience seems more fitting. While the advice of family and friends is invaluable, there is no substitute for the wisdom gained through our own trials and errors. By embracing this approach, we can develop a more authentic and self-sufficient understanding of life, one that is tailored to our unique experiences and perspectives. Ultimately, a balance between seeking guidance and exploring life on our own terms can provide the most comprehensive and enriching understanding of this complex and multifaceted journey we call life.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;Childhood is often considered the happiest time of a person's life, and for good reason. During this stage, individuals are generally more carefree and joyful compared to their adult years. In childhood, the daily routine is simple and uncomplicated, consisting of attending school, playing with friends, and getting a good night's sleep. This straightforward and predictable schedule allows children to focus on the present moment, unencumbered by the complexities and worries that come with adulthood.Furthermore, childhood is also a time of great creativity. Children are naturally curious and inventive, with vibrant imaginations and a willingness to take risks. They are not yet bound by the conventions and expectations of society, and are therefore free to explore and express themselves in a multitude of ways. This creativity is often expressed through art, music, and imaginative play, which are all essential components of a happy and fulfilling childhood.As people grow into adulthood, the pressures and responsibilities of life can stifle this creativity and sense of wonder. The stresses of work, relationships, and financial obligations can weigh heavily on the mind, making it difficult to maintain the carefree spirit of childhood. In addition, the routine of daily life can become monotonous and predictable, leaving little room for spontaneity and exploration.In conclusion, childhood is indeed the happiest time of a person's life. The simplicity and creativity of this stage allow individuals to experience life to the fullest, unencumbered by the complexities and worries of adulthood. As people grow older, it is essential to hold onto the sense of wonder and imagination that defined their childhood, and to continue to cultivate creativity and joy in all aspects of life.
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we prepare food, making it easier and more convenient than ever before. With the introduction of kitchen appliances such as microwaves and toasters, cooking has become a breeze, freeing many housewives from the tedious and time-consuming process of cooking.In the past, cooking was a labor-intensive task that required hours of preparation, from chopping vegetables to cooking meals over an open flame. Housewives spent most of their day in the kitchen, leaving them little time for other activities. However, with the advancement of technology, kitchen appliances have simplified the cooking process, enabling people to prepare meals quickly and efficiently.Microwaves, for instance, can cook a variety of meals in a matter of minutes, from reheating leftovers to cooking frozen meals. Toaster ovens have also become a staple in many kitchens, allowing people to cook a range of dishes, from toast to roasted vegetables. These appliances have not only saved time but also reduced the physical effort required for cooking.The impact of this change has been significant, particularly for housewives. Liberated from the drudgery of cooking, they now have more time to pursue other interests and activities. Many have taken up hobbies, such as painting, gardening, or reading, while others have enrolled in courses or taken up part-time jobs. The additional time has also enabled them to spend more time with their families, strengthening relationships and creating lasting memories.In conclusion, the advancement of technology has transformed the way we prepare food, making it easier, faster, and more convenient. The introduction of kitchen appliances has freed many housewives from the tedious cooking process, giving them the time and opportunity to pursue more meaningful activities. As technology continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how it will further impact our daily lives and cooking habits.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;Living with one's parents for a longer period has often been perceived as a negative trend, especially among young adults. However, this arrangement has numerous benefits, not only for the children but also for the parents. One of the most significant advantages is the opportunity to create lasting memories with parents.Living with parents longer allows children to spend quality time with them, sharing daily experiences, and creating memories that will last a lifetime. This shared experience strengthens family bonds and fosters a deeper understanding between parents and children. Moreover, living with parents provides children with the opportunity to learn valuable life skills, such as cooking, cleaning, and managing finances, from their parents.Another significant benefit of living with parents longer is the opportunity to save money. Without the burden of rent, utilities, and other expenses associated with independent living, children can allocate a larger portion of their income towards savings, education, or career development. This financial freedom can be particularly beneficial for young adults who are just starting their careers or pursuing higher education.Furthermore, living with parents longer also provides children with the benefit of advice and guidance from their parents. Parents have a wealth of experience and knowledge to share, and living with them allows children to tap into this resource. Whether it's advice on relationships, career choices, or financial management, parents can offer valuable insights that can help their children make informed decisions.In conclusion, living with parents longer has numerous benefits for both children and parents. It provides an opportunity to create lasting memories, save money, and seek advice and guidance from parents. In a word, parents can save money, and benefit in many ways, if their children live with them longer. This arrangement can foster a stronger, more supportive family unit, and provide a solid foundation for young adults as they transition into independence.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;The zoo is an often-overlooked institution that plays a vital role in our society. Not only does it provide a safe haven for animals, but it also serves as a crucial hub for learning and education. The importance of zoos cannot be overstated, and their benefits extend far beyond mere entertainment.One of the primary reasons why zoos are essential is that they help animals avoid extinction. By providing a controlled environment for endangered species to breed and thrive, zoos play a critical role in conservation efforts. Many zoos are involved in breeding programs for species that are on the brink of extinction, such as pandas, elephants, and tigers. These programs help to increase the population of these species, which can then be released back into the wild. This not only helps to ensure the survival of these species but also helps to maintain the delicate balance of ecosystems.In addition to their conservation efforts, zoos are also a valuable resource for learning and education. They provide a unique opportunity for people, especially children, to learn about different animal species and their habitats. By observing animals in a naturalistic setting, visitors can gain a deeper understanding of the importance of conservation and the impact of human actions on the environment. Many zoos also offer educational programs and activities that teach visitors about the importance of wildlife conservation and the role that they can play in protecting the environment.Finally, zoos are also a significant tourist attraction, generating revenue and creating jobs for local communities. They provide a fun and educational experience for visitors, while also promoting the importance of conservation and wildlife preservation. In many cities, zoos are a popular destination for families and school groups, and they play an important role in promoting tourism and economic development.In conclusion, zoos are a vital institution that plays a critical role in conservation, education, and tourism. They provide a safe haven for endangered species, offer a unique opportunity for learning and education, and generate revenue for local communities. As such, it is essential that we continue to support and promote the importance of zoos in our society.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;Parents are widely regarded as the first teachers a child encounters in their life. The role they play in shaping a child's physical, emotional, and social development is unparalleled. From the earliest stages of life, parents instill in their children the essential skills of walking and speaking, laying the foundation for future growth.As a child takes their first steps, the patience and encouragement of parents play a pivotal role in fostering confidence and independence. Similarly, the initial babble of a baby gradually evolves into coherent speech, thanks to the relentless efforts of parents to engage in conversations and promote linguistic development.Moreover, parents have a profound impact on the moral upbringing of their children. By inculcating values such as empathy, honesty, and respect, parents equip their children with the tools necessary to become good individuals. The love and support they provide create a nurturing environment that allows children to flourish and develop into compassionate and responsible beings.The primary goal of parents is to ensure their children's future success and happiness. To achieve this, they strive to create an optimal environment that facilitates their child's development. This involves providing access to quality education, healthcare, and extracurricular activities that cater to their child's interests and aptitudes. By making sacrifices and going the extra mile, parents demonstrate their unwavering commitment to their child's well-being and prosperity.In conclusion, parents are the pillars of a child's development, providing the love, guidance, and support necessary for them to thrive. Through their tireless efforts, parents empower their children with the skills, values, and knowledge required to succeed in life. As the first teachers, parents set the stage for their child's future achievements, shaping them into capable, compassionate, and responsible individuals.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;The impact of television on children has been a topic of debate for many years. While some argue that television has a profoundly negative effect on children, others claim that it can be a valuable learning tool. In this essay, we will explore the positive effects of television on children and argue that, if used wisely, television can have more positive than negative effects.On the one hand, many people believe that television can have a negative impact on children. Exposure to violent or inappropriate content can lead to desensitization, aggression, and even imitative behavior. For example, watching violent TV shows or movies can make children more aggressive and prone to fighting. Additionally, excessive TV viewing can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health problems.On the other hand, if used wisely, television can have numerous positive effects on children. Educational programs such as Sesame Street, Blue's Clues, and National Geographic Kids can enhance children's cognitive skills, such as problem-solving, literacy, and numeracy. These programs can also promote social skills, like empathy, self-awareness, and cultural diversity. Furthermore, TV shows that promote creativity, such as art or cooking programs, can foster children's imagination and self-expression.Moreover, television can be a valuable resource for learning about different cultures, histories, and scientific concepts. Documentaries and nature programs can spark children's interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, preparing them for future careers. In conclusion, while television can have negative effects on children, its positive effects can outweigh the negative ones if children use TV programs wisely. By watching educational and informative programs, children can develop valuable skills, knowledge, and values that can benefit them throughout their lives.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;The notion that hiring employees for their entire lives is the key to ensuring productivity and efficiency in the workplace has been a long-standing assumption among many entrepreneurs. However, I firmly disagree with this perspective, viewing it as not only conservative but also outdated. In my opinion, businesses would be better off not employing workers for their entire lives, and there are three crucial reasons that support this stance.Firstly, lifelong employment can lead to stagnation and complacency among employees. When individuals know they have job security for life, they may become less motivated to innovate, take risks, or strive for excellence. This can result in a lack of creativity, innovation, and progress within the organization. On the other hand, a more dynamic employment structure can foster a culture of continuous learning, growth, and improvement.Secondly, the modern workforce is increasingly characterized by diversity, mobility, and changing career aspirations. Many employees today value flexibility, autonomy, and the freedom to pursue different opportunities and passions. Lifelong employment can be restrictive, limiting employees' ability to explore new horizons, acquire new skills, or transition to new industries. By not employing workers for life, businesses can attract and retain top talent who value flexibility and are more likely to contribute to the organization's success in the short-term.Lastly, lifelong employment can also limit an organization's ability to adapt to changing market conditions, technologies, and industry trends. When employees are hired for life, businesses may be less inclined to invest in new talent, technologies, or training programs, which can hinder their ability to stay competitive and innovative. By adopting a more flexible employment approach, businesses can stay agile, respond to changing market demands, and maintain a competitive edge.In conclusion, while the idea of lifelong employment may have been relevant in the past, it is no longer a viable or desirable approach in today's fast-paced, dynamic business environment. By recognizing the benefits of a more flexible employment structure, businesses can foster a culture of innovation, attract and retain top talent, and maintain a competitive edge in an ever-changing market landscape.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";Childhood is often regarded as the happiest period of one's life, and for good reason. It is a time of unbridled joy, curiosity, and wonder. Children are constantly discovering new things, exploring their surroundings, and learning about the world around them. This sense of discovery and awe is a key factor in making childhood such a happy time.One of the most significant aspects of childhood is the sense of surprise that comes with it. Children are constantly being introduced to new experiences, people, and ideas, and their reactions are often ones of amazement and delight. Whether it's seeing a puppy for the first time, tasting a new food, or learning a new skill, children are constantly surprised and fascinated by the world around them. This sense of surprise is a key factor in making childhood such a magical time.Another great thing about childhood is the freedom to imagine and say what you think. Children are not yet bound by the conventions and expectations of adulthood, and are free to express themselves in whatever way they see fit. They can imagine themselves as superheroes, princesses, or anything else they can think of, and are encouraged to express their creativity and individuality. This freedom to imagine and express themselves is a key factor in making childhood such a happy and carefree time.Furthermore, childhood is also a time of great imagination and creativity. Children are constantly coming up with new ideas, making up games, and creating their own stories. They are not yet limited by the constraints of reality, and are free to let their imaginations run wild. This sense of imagination and creativity is a key factor in making childhood such a happy and fulfilling time.In conclusion, childhood is indeed the happiest period of one's life. The sense of surprise, freedom to imagine and express oneself, and imagination and creativity all combine to make childhood a time of great joy and wonder. As we grow older, we often lose some of these qualities, and it's up to us to try to recapture them and hold onto the magic of childhood.
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";The Past: A Treasure Trove of Lessons for a Brighter FutureIt is a common misconception that the past has no bearing on the present, as time marches relentlessly forward. However, this notion couldn't be further from the truth. The past is a rich tapestry of experiences, mistakes, successes, and knowledge that can greatly inform and enrich our present and future. Rather than ignoring or dismissing the past, we should actively seek to learn from it, harnessing its wisdom to create a brighter tomorrow.History is replete with examples of how the past can teach us valuable lessons. By studying the successes and failures of our predecessors, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. For instance, the mistakes of historical leaders can serve as cautionary tales, while their successes can inspire us to strive for greatness. Moreover, the past is a treasure trove of knowledge in various fields of study, from science and technology to art and literature.By embracing the past, we can also gain a deeper appreciation for the present and a clearer vision for the future. We can learn from the triumphs and tribulations of those who came before us, and use this knowledge to inform our decisions and shape our worldviews. Moreover, the past can serve as a source of inspiration, motivating us to build upon the achievements of previous generations and push the boundaries of human innovation and progress.In conclusion, the past is not a relic to be discarded, but a valuable resource to be tapped. By learning from the successes, mistakes, and knowledge of the past, we can create a brighter future for ourselves and for generations to come. Rather than ignoring the past, we should make full use of it, harnessing its wisdom to build a better world, one lesson at a time.
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;Space exploration has long been a cornerstone of human innovation, with the 20th century marking a significant milestone in our quest for discovery beyond Earth's bounds. As we ventured into the unknown, space exploration evolved into a multifaceted endeavor, encompassing scientific inquiry, technological advancement, and even military prowess. In my opinion, allocating a substantial budget for space exploration is crucial for ensuring the long-term survival of humanity.During the Cold War era, space exploration became an integral tool for military power, with the United States and the Soviet Union engaging in a heated space race. This rivalry not only accelerated technological progress but also underscored the strategic importance of space dominance. However, beyond its military applications, space exploration has yielded numerous benefits for humanity.By investing in space exploration, we expand our understanding of the universe, uncovering secrets that can have a profound impact on our daily lives. For instance, research on space weather and solar flares has improved our ability to predict and prepare for natural disasters. Moreover, the technological innovations born from space exploration, such as satellite communications and GPS, have revolutionized the way we navigate and interact with one another.Moreover, space exploration holds the key to addressing some of humanity's most pressing challenges, including resource depletion and climate change. By exploring and potentially harnessing the resources of other planets and celestial bodies, we can mitigate the strain on our planet's finite resources. Furthermore, understanding the effects of climate change on a universal scale can provide valuable insights into preserving our own planet's delicate ecosystem.In conclusion, space exploration is a vital investment for humanity's future. While its military applications are undeniable, its scientific and technological benefits hold far greater promise for the advancement of our species.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";The advent of television has revolutionized the way we consume information, entertainment, and connect with others. While some argue that television has eroded communication among friends and families, I firmly believe that it has had a profoundly positive impact on our interpersonal relationships.Television has bridged geographical gaps, enabling people to connect with others across the globe. With the rise of satellite TV and international broadcasting, we can now access a vast array of programs from different cultures and countries. This has fostered a sense of global citizenship, allowing us to engage with diverse perspectives and ideas. Moreover, TV has enabled families to bond over shared viewing experiences, creating common topics of conversation and strengthening relationships.Furthermore, television has democratized access to information, making it possible for people from all walks of life to stay informed about current events, news, and educational programs. This has facilitated meaningful discussions and debates, encouraging critical thinking and intellectual exchange among friends and family members. TV has also provided a platform for people to engage with each other through live events, such as sports, music festivals, and award shows, which often spark lively conversations and communal enthusiasm.In addition, television has played a vital role in shaping our cultural identity and preserving our heritage. Through documentaries, historical dramas, and cultural programs, TV has helped to raise awareness about our collective past, promoting a sense of shared history and values. This, in turn, has fostered a deeper understanding and appreciation of our cultural diversity, bringing people closer together.In conclusion, while some may argue that television has undermined communication, I firmly believe that it has had a profoundly positive impact on our relationships. By bridging geographical divides, democratizing access to information, and promoting cultural exchange, TV has brought people closer together, fostering a sense of community and shared experience. As a ubiquitous part of our daily lives, television continues to play a vital role in shaping our connections with others.
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;"The age-old adage ""to let sleeping dogs lie"" is a common phrase that echoes in our minds when we're faced with the dilemma of whether to intervene in a friend's decision-making process. The argument rages on: is it better to let a friend make a mistake and learn from it, or to take action and risk potentially destroying a friendship? As a staunch supporter of non-interference, I firmly believe that letting a friend make a mistake is the better choice. In this essay, I will present two compelling reasons that solidify my opinion.Firstly, allowing a friend to make a mistake fosters personal growth and accountability. When we intervene, we deprive our friends of the opportunity to learn from their errors and develop essential problem-solving skills. By letting them navigate their own mistakes, we enable them to take ownership of their decisions and develop a sense of responsibility. This, in turn, promotes self-awareness, resilience, and emotional intelligence – all of which are crucial for personal development. By contrast, constant intervention can create a culture of dependency, where our friends rely on us to bail them out of trouble, rather than learning to extricate themselves.Secondly, intervening in a friend's decision-making process can lead to unintended consequences that may irreparably damage the friendship. When we offer unsolicited advice or attempt to correct our friends' mistakes, we risk coming across as judgmental, controlling, or even condescending. This can lead to feelings of resentment, hurt, and frustration, ultimately straining the relationship. By choosing not to intervene, we demonstrate our trust in our friends' ability to make decisions, which strengthens the bond of our friendship and fosters a sense of mutual respect.In conclusion, while it may be tempting to intervene in a friend's decision-making process, it is often better to let them make mistakes and learn from them. By doing so, we promote personal growth, accountability, and a stronger, more respectful friendship."
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;Title: Preparing for Adulthood: The Importance of Part-time Jobs for TeenagersAs a society, we often emphasize the importance of education in shaping the future of our youth. However, I firmly believe that taking a part-time job is equally crucial for teenage children to prepare them for adult life. In my view, this is the best way for teenagers to transition into adulthood, and I will outline several reasons to support this argument.First and foremost, having a part-time job allows teenagers to earn money independently, rather than relying on pocket money from their parents. This newfound financial freedom not only teaches them the value of hard-earned money but also encourages them to manage their finances responsibly. As they earn their own income, they learn to prioritize their spending, save for the future, and make smart financial decisions.Moreover, a part-time job provides teenagers with essential life skills, such as time management, discipline, and responsibility. When they report to work, they must adhere to a schedule, meet deadlines, and comply with company rules. If they are frequently late or underperform, they may face consequences, such as reduced payment or even termination. These experiences teach them the importance of punctuality, accountability, and reliability, essential qualities for success in their future careers.Furthermore, part-time jobs expose teenagers to real-world scenarios, enabling them to develop problem-solving skills, teamwork, and communication. They learn to interact with colleagues, customers, and supervisors, fostering their interpersonal skills and confidence. By navigating the challenges of a part-time job, teenagers gain valuable insights into the workforce, preparing them for the demands of adult life.In conclusion, taking a part-time job is an invaluable experience for teenage children. It not only teaches them financial responsibility but also instills essential life skills, such as discipline, accountability, and teamwork. As they navigate the workforce, they gain a deeper understanding of the adult world, ultimately preparing them for a successful transition into independent adulthood.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;Living in a big city or the countryside are two different lifestyles that offer distinct experiences and opportunities. As a young adult, I have come to realize that the city offers a more vibrant and diverse environment, while the countryside presents a more restricted and studious lifestyle.In a big city, there are numerous kinds of people from various backgrounds and cultures, making it a melting pot of diversity. The city also offers a wide range of activities and entertainment options, providing endless possibilities for leisure and personal growth. From cultural events to recreational activities, the city has something to offer for everyone. On the other hand, the countryside is characterized by a more limited and tranquil environment. While it may be ideal for studying and focusing on academic pursuits, it lacks the excitement and diversity that the city has to offer.However, one aspect that is common to both the city and the countryside is the presence of gossip. Regardless of where one lives, gossip and rumors can spread quickly, affecting one's reputation and personal life. This is a challenge that one must face in either environment.Despite the similarities, the city and countryside differ significantly in terms of opportunities and lifestyle. Growing up in the countryside requires a strong focus on studying to pass the entrance exams to enter university, which can be a daunting task. On the other hand, the city offers a more balanced lifestyle, with opportunities for education, entertainment, and personal growth.As I look to the future, I am certain that if I have children, they will grow up in the city. The city offers a more dynamic and stimulating environment that will allow them to grow and develop into well-rounded individuals. While the countryside may be ideal for focused studying, the city provides a more comprehensive and exciting lifestyle that I believe is essential for a child's development.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;The influence of parents on their children cannot be overstated. The things that parents say have great power over their child, often carrying more weight than the words of friends or other adults. This is largely due to the significant amount of time children spend with their parents, providing them with ample opportunity to impart their values, beliefs, and life lessons.Unlike other relationships, where interactions may be limited to specific settings or periods of time, the parent-child bond is constant and ongoing. Children typically spend more time with their parents than with anyone else, including friends, teachers, or extended family members. This proximity allows parents to have a profound impact on their child's development, shaping their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in ways that may not be possible for others.Moreover, children often mirror themselves on their parents, adopting their mannerisms, attitudes, and values. This is a natural process, as children look to their parents as role models and strive to emulate them. As a result, the things that parents say and do take on added significance, as children are constantly observing and learning from them. Positive reinforcement, encouragement, and constructive feedback from parents can foster a sense of self-worth, confidence, and resilience in children, while negative comments or behaviors can have the opposite effect.The power of parental influence is a double-edged sword, highlighting the importance of thoughtful and intentional communication. Parents have a unique opportunity to shape their child's worldview, values, and character, and it is essential that they use this influence wisely. By being mindful of the impact of their words and actions, parents can help their children develop into capable, compassionate, and responsible individuals, equipped to navigate the challenges of life. Ultimately, the profound influence of parents on their children serves as a reminder of the significant responsibility that comes with parenting, and the enduring legacy that parents leave on their child's life.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;The rapid development of food processing technology has revolutionized the way we prepare and consume food. With the advancement of industrial food production, meal preparation has become faster and more convenient. The introduction of automated machinery and advanced preservation techniques has enabled mass production of a wide variety of foods, making them more accessible and affordable for the general population. As a result, food can be prepared more easily and efficiently, saving time and effort for individuals.Moreover, industrial food production has also led to significant improvements in food quality and taste. Advanced processing techniques and ingredient manipulation have enabled the creation of a wide range of flavors and textures, making food more enjoyable and diverse. Furthermore, the use of preservatives and additives has extended the shelf life of food products, allowing for global distribution and consumption of a vast array of cuisines.However, with the benefits of industrial food production come significant health concerns. Many processed foods are high in unhealthy ingredients such as saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium, which can lead to a range of diet-related health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the widespread use of artificial additives and preservatives has been linked to various health issues, including allergies, intolerances, and even cancer.Therefore, while the development of industrial food production has undoubtedly made food more convenient and enjoyable, it is essential for individuals to be mindful of their dietary choices. It is crucial to read food labels carefully, be aware of the ingredients and nutritional content, and opt for whole, nutrient-dense foods whenever possible. By making informed choices, individuals can reap the benefits of industrial food production while protecting their health and wellbeing. Ultimately, a balanced and mindful approach to food consumption is necessary to fully harness the advantages of modern food technology.
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The debate about whether schools should require students to take regular standardized exams has been ongoing for years. While some argue that these exams are unnecessary and create undue stress for students, others believe that they are essential for evaluating student performance and ensuring academic fairness. In this essay, we will argue that standardized exams are a necessary part of the educational system and should be continued.One of the primary reasons why standardized exams are preferable is that they help teachers to fairly grade students. By administering a standardized exam, teachers can assess students' knowledge and understanding of a particular subject in a fair and objective manner. This is particularly important in a classroom setting where teachers may have preconceived notions or biases about certain students. Standardized exams eliminate these biases, ensuring that students are graded solely on their academic performance.Furthermore, many teachers rely heavily on exam results when grading a class. Standardized exams provide teachers with a clear and objective measure of student performance, allowing them to accurately assess student understanding and assign grades accordingly. This is particularly useful in large classes where teachers may not have the time or resources to thoroughly assess each student's performance. By relying on standardized exam results, teachers can ensure that grades are assigned fairly and consistently.In conclusion, standardized exams are a necessary part of the educational system. They provide teachers with a fair and objective measure of student performance, allowing them to accurately assess student understanding and assign grades accordingly. While some may argue that these exams create undue stress for students, the benefits of standardized exams far outweigh the drawbacks. Schools should continue to require students to take regular standardized exams to ensure academic fairness and accuracy in grading.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";In today's world, education has become a costly affair. The rising expenses associated with pursuing higher education have led to a growing trend of students opting for self-financed education. This phenomenon has sparked an interesting debate about the concept of free education and its potential impact on students' motivation.On one hand, the idea of free education may seem like a utopian dream, but it has the power to inspire scholars who are genuinely passionate about learning. When education is free, students are not burdened by the weight of financial constraints, and they can focus solely on their academic pursuits. This freedom from financial stress allows them to concentrate on their studies, explore their interests, and develop their skills without any hindrances.Moreover, the notion of free education has the potential to bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots. In a world where education is free, students from underprivileged backgrounds can have equal access to quality education, thereby leveling the playing field. This can lead to a more meritocratic society where students are judged solely on their academic prowess, rather than their financial means.However, critics argue that free education is not a sustainable model, as it would require significant government funding and may lead to a lack of accountability among students. While these concerns are valid, it is essential to recognize that the benefits of free education far outweigh the drawbacks.In conclusion, the idea of free education has the power to inspire students who are genuinely passionate about learning. It has the potential to create a more inclusive and meritocratic society, where students are not burdened by financial constraints. As the world grapples with the challenges of rising educational costs, it is essential to explore innovative models of free education that can make quality learning accessible to all.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;Professors in a university are often perceived as simply teachers, whose primary role is to educate students. However, this perspective overlooks the significant impact of their research endeavors. While teaching is undoubtedly a crucial aspect of their job, it is imperative to acknowledge that professors' research activities are equally, if not more, important.There are several reasons why professors should allocate more time to research rather than solely focusing on educating students. Firstly, research drives innovation and progress in various fields. By dedicating more time to research, professors can make groundbreaking discoveries, develop new theories, and contribute to the advancement of their discipline. This, in turn, benefits society as a whole, as new knowledge and technologies emerge from their findings.Secondly, research is a key factor in maintaining a university's reputation and ranking. Institutions that prioritize research are more likely to attract top talent, secure funding, and establish themselves as leaders in their field. Professors who actively engage in research activities not only enhance their own expertise but also elevate the university's profile, making it more attractive to prospective students and faculty.Lastly, research informs and enhances teaching. Professors who are actively involved in research can draw upon their experiences and findings to create more engaging, relevant, and up-to-date course materials. This, in turn, benefits students, who gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and are better equipped to tackle real-world problems.In conclusion, while teaching is a vital aspect of a professor's role, it is essential to recognize the significance of research in driving innovation, maintaining a university's reputation, and informing teaching practices. By allocating more time to research, professors can make meaningful contributions to their field, benefit society, and ultimately, enrich the educational experience of their students.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;The influence of television and movies on people's behavior is a widely debated topic. While some argue that they have a positive impact, it is evident that their negative effects far outweigh their positive ones. In this essay, we will explore how television and movies negatively influence people's behavior.One of the most significant negative influences of television and movies is their impact on people's eating habits. Advertisements for junk food and sugary drinks are prevalent on television and in movies, making them appealing to viewers, especially children. This has led to an increase in consumption of unhealthy foods, contributing to the growing problem of obesity and related health issues. People are more likely to grab a bag of chips or a sugary snack while watching a movie, rather than preparing a healthy meal.Another way in which television and movies negatively influence behavior is by reducing social interaction. Spending excessive time watching television or movies can lead to social isolation, as people spend less time with friends and family. This can have serious consequences, including depression, anxiety, and loneliness. In contrast, engaging in social activities and spending time with loved ones is essential for building strong relationships and maintaining mental health.Television and movies can also influence people's behavior by promoting unrealistic expectations and encouraging them to adopt a false persona. The portrayal of perfect bodies, luxurious lifestyles, and unrealistic relationships can lead to low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, and a distorted view of reality. People may feel pressured to conform to these unrealistic standards, leading to a loss of individuality and authenticity.In conclusion, while television and movies may have some positive influences on behavior, their negative effects far outweigh their positive ones. They promote unhealthy eating habits, reduce social interaction, and encourage people to adopt a false persona.
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;Museums have long been revered as treasuries of knowledge, offering a glimpse into the rich history and culture of a particular region. Beyond their educational value, museums also provide a unique opportunity for social interaction, allowing visitors to forge connections and foster meaningful relationships with like-minded individuals.As one navigates the hallowed halls of a museum, they are immersed in a wealth of information that spans centuries, civilizations, and artistic movements. From ancient artifacts to contemporary exhibitions, museums present a vast array of cultural and historical relics that not only educate but also captivate the imagination. By engaging with these exhibits, visitors can gain a deeper understanding of the context and significance of the artifacts on display, broadening their knowledge and appreciation of the world around them.Moreover, museums offer a shared experience that can facilitate social connections and friendships. As strangers gather around a particular exhibit, they are presented with a common topic of discussion, allowing them to engage with one another and establish relationships. These conversations can range from casual observations to in-depth analyses, providing a unique opportunity for individuals to share their perspectives and learn from others.By participating in these conversations, visitors can expand their knowledge and gain new insights, while also developing essential communication skills. Furthermore, the shared experience of visiting a museum can create a sense of camaraderie among strangers, allowing them to connect with others who share similar interests and passions.In conclusion, museums provide a rich and multifaceted experience that extends beyond mere education. They offer a platform for social interaction, allowing visitors to forge connections, establish relationships, and participate in conversations that can broaden their knowledge and understanding of the world. As such, museums remain an indispensable part of our cultural landscape, providing a unique opportunity for individuals to engage with others and enrich their lives through the shared experience of discovery and exploration.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"The age-old adage, ""a man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues,"" holds profound truth. The way an individual conducts themselves, through their behavior, speech, and body language, serves as a window into their character, values, and intentions. A person with good manners exudes a certain charm, creating a favorable impression on those they interact with.Politeness and tender words, in particular, are essential components of good manners. When employed, they have a profound impact on both the speaker and the listener. For the speaker, courteous language and demeanor can earn them a reputation as a kind, considerate, and compassionate individual. This, in turn, fosters respect, trust, and admiration from others, leading to stronger, more meaningful relationships.Moreover, the listeners, especially those in need, greatly benefit from encountering individuals with good manners. A gentle tone, empathetic words, and a listening ear can be a balm to the weary soul. It can provide solace, reassurance, and encouragement, helping to uplift and motivate. When we treat others with kindness and respect, we create a ripple effect, inspiring them to do the same, and contributing to a more harmonious and supportive community.In contrast, a lack of good manners can lead to strained relationships, misunderstandings, and conflict. When we prioritize politeness and tender words, we not only reflect positively on ourselves but also create a positive impact on those around us. As we navigate our daily interactions, it is essential to remember that our mannerisms have the power to inspire, uplift, and bring people together.In conclusion, good manners are indeed a mirror that reflects our virtues. By embracing politeness and tender words, we not only project a positive image but also contribute to a more compassionate and supportive environment. As we strive to become better versions of ourselves, it is essential to prioritize good manners, recognizing the profound impact they can have on ourselves and those around us."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;The notion that the difficulties people encounter in their early years will ultimately become an invaluable fortune in their future lives is a topic of much debate. While some may argue that these challenges can be detrimental to one's development, I firmly believe that they can indeed have a profoundly positive impact on an individual's life path.To begin with, hardship has a way of teaching people to appreciate the small, yet wonderful things in life. When one is faced with adversity, they are forced to re-evaluate their priorities and find joy in the everyday moments that often go unnoticed. This ability to cherish and compliment the little things in life is a valuable asset that can bring a sense of happiness and contentment to one's life. For instance, a person who has experienced financial difficulties in their youth may learn to appreciate the simple pleasures of life, such as spending time with loved ones or enjoying nature, rather than relying on material possessions for happiness.Moreover, people who have faced numerous difficulties in their lives tend to be calmer in the face of trouble. Having already overcome significant challenges, they are better equipped to handle future obstacles with ease. This sense of calm and composure can be a powerful tool in both personal and professional settings, allowing individuals to make rational decisions and navigate complex situations with greater ease. Furthermore, the experiences of overcoming adversity can instill a sense of resilience and determination, driving individuals to push through challenges that might otherwise seem insurmountable.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the difficulties people encounter in their early years can indeed become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. By teaching individuals to appreciate the little things in life and equipping them with the calm and resilience needed to navigate challenges, these experiences can have a profoundly positive impact on one's life path.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;The debate about whether city life or rural life is superior has been ongoing for years. While both options have their advantages and disadvantages, it is clear that city life offers a more comprehensive and dynamic experience.One of the primary reasons why city life is more appealing is the superior education system. Cities have more resources and better-funded schools, which provide students with a wider range of academic and extracurricular opportunities. Additionally, cities offer more job opportunities, with a diverse range of industries and career paths available. This diversity is also reflected in the cultural landscape of cities, where people from different backgrounds and ethnicities come together to create a vibrant and dynamic community. With more citizens living in close proximity, cities offer a unique cultural experience that is hard to find in rural areas.In terms of communication, cities also have an advantage. With more frequent bus and train services, it is easy to get around and connect with others. This infrastructure also facilitates the exchange of ideas and innovation, making cities hubs of creativity and progress.On the other hand, the countryside has its own unique advantages. The peaceful and serene environment provides a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of city life. With more open spaces and natural scenery, the countryside is an ideal place to relax and unwind. Furthermore, the slower pace of life in rural areas can be beneficial for those looking to escape the stresses of modern life.In conclusion, while both city and rural life have their advantages, the benefits of city life are more significant. The superior education system, diverse job opportunities, and vibrant cultural scene make cities an attractive option for those looking to live a dynamic and fulfilling life.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;The increasing affluence of society has led to a shift in priorities among individuals. As people's basic needs are met, they begin to focus on more abstract mental requirements, such as happiness. While some may find happiness in their careers, I firmly believe that one's living environment plays a more significant role in determining overall satisfaction for the majority of people.On one hand, a fulfilling job can undoubtedly bring joy and a sense of accomplishment to some individuals. A career that aligns with one's passions and values can provide a sense of purpose and motivation, leading to increased happiness. However, this is not the case for everyone. Many people find themselves stuck in unfulfilling jobs, struggling to make ends meet, or working long hours that leave them exhausted. For these individuals, happiness is not derived from their job, but rather from their living environment.On the other hand, one's living environment has a profound impact on their overall well-being. A safe, comfortable, and beautiful home can provide a sense of security and tranquility, allowing individuals to recharge and relax after a long day. Access to nature, community spaces, and social connections can also greatly contribute to one's happiness. Moreover, a living environment that promotes physical activity, healthy eating, and adequate sleep can have a direct impact on both physical and mental health, leading to increased happiness.In conclusion, while a job can offer happiness to some, I believe that one's living environment is more crucial in determining overall satisfaction for most people. As society continues to prioritize mental requirements like happiness, it is essential to focus on creating living environments that promote well-being, rather than solely relying on careers to bring joy. By doing so, we can create a more balanced and fulfilling life that caters to the needs of both body and mind.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, offering a multitude of options for staying in touch with others. We can choose from voicemail, email, telephone, or traditional face-to-face interactions. While each method has its unique advantages, I firmly believe that email stands out as the most preferred mode of communication for me, owing to three compelling reasons: convenience, honest expression, and fluency in communication.Firstly, email offers unparalleled convenience. With the ability to send and receive messages at any time and from any location, email has made it possible to transcend geographical boundaries and time zones. This asynchronous nature of email allows me to respond to messages at my own pace, without the pressure of immediate responses that comes with phone calls or face-to-face conversations.Secondly, email provides a platform for honest expression. When communicating in person or over the phone, there can be pressure to respond impulsively, potentially leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications. Email, on the other hand, affords me the luxury of time to gather my thoughts, articulate my ideas, and edit my responses before hitting send. This thoughtful approach to communication fosters clarity and reduces the likelihood of misinterpretations.Lastly, email enables fluency in communication. Unlike face-to-face interactions where thoughts may be lost in the moment, or phone calls where ideas may be misunderstood due to poor reception, email allows me to craft and convey my thoughts in a clear, concise manner. This written record of our exchange also serves as a valuable reference point, reducing the risk of misremembering important details or actions.In conclusion, while technology has opened up numerous avenues for communication, I firmly believe that email is the most effective and preferred method for me. Its convenience, ability to facilitate honest expression, and fluency in communication make it an indispensable tool in both personal and professional settings.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";The Impact of Television on Human InteractionIn recent years, the advent of television has revolutionized the way people spend their leisure time. While television has its benefits, such as providing entertainment, education, and information, its negative impacts far outweigh its positive effects. One of the most significant drawbacks of television is its impact on human interaction and conversation.Television has led to a decline in face-to-face conversations among people. With the abundance of TV shows and programs available, people are increasingly spending more time glued to their screens, leaving little time for meaningful interactions with others. This has resulted in a society where people are more comfortable interacting with their televisions than with each other. Social skills, such as active listening and responding, are being lost as people rely more on their TVs for entertainment and companionship.Furthermore, television shows often distract people from what is truly important in life. Many programs focus on materialism, consumerism, and superficial values, leading viewers to prioritize these aspects over more meaningful pursuits. For instance, reality TV shows often promote a culture of competition and individualism, while neglecting values like empathy, cooperation, and community building. As a result, people become so engrossed in their favorite programs that they forget to engage with their surroundings, neglecting their relationships, health, and personal growth.Another negative consequence of television is the obsessive behavior it fosters in its viewers. Fans of particular shows often become fixated on them, spending hours in front of the TV, waiting for the next episode. This obsession can lead to an unhealthy dependence on television, causing individuals to neglect their responsibilities, relationships, and overall well-being.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;The Rise of Digital Communication: Why E-mails and Voice Mails Reign SupremeIn today's fast-paced world, communication is key. While many people still prefer traditional methods of communication such as telephone or face-to-face interactions, I firmly believe that communicating through e-mails or voice mails is the better option. This essay will highlight the reasons behind my stance, providing insight into the benefits of digital communication.First and foremost, e-mails and voice mails offer an ease of communication that is unmatched by traditional methods. For many individuals, the prospect of calling someone they are not acquainted with can be daunting. Writing a voice mail or composing an e-mail, on the other hand, alleviates this anxiety, allowing for a more natural flow of communication. This is particularly significant in professional settings, where initial contact is often made with someone unknown.Another significant advantage of digital communication is its flexibility. Unlike traditional telephone communication, which is time-bound, e-mails can be written at any time of the day. This flexibility is especially beneficial for those with busy schedules, allowing them to manage their communications at their convenience. As someone who values flexibility, I find this aspect of digital communication particularly appealing. It enables me to stay in touch with others without being tied to specific times, enhancing both personal and professional relationships.In conclusion, the benefits of communicating through e-mails and voice mails far outweigh those of traditional methods. Not only do they offer ease and convenience, but they also cater to the increasingly fast-paced nature of our lives. As we move forward in this digital age, embracing these forms of communication will undoubtedly lead to more effective and stress-free interactions.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;"The old adage ""haste makes waste"" has been a guiding principle for many individuals throughout history. In today's fast-paced world, where instant gratification and quick fixes are often prioritized, it's easy to get caught up in making hasty decisions. However, the reality is that every fast and not well-thought-out decision is indeed a wasted one. Making quick decisions, without careful consideration and deliberation, often leads to probable bad results.When we rush into decisions, we often overlook crucial details, neglect to weigh our options, and fail to consider the long-term consequences. This impulsiveness can lead to choices that are not in our best interest, resulting in wasted time, resources, and opportunities. Moreover, hurried decisions can have a ripple effect, impacting not only our immediate circumstances but also our future prospects.The consequences of impulsive decisions can be far-reaching, affecting every aspect of our lives. For instance, a hasty decision in our personal relationships can lead to strained connections and damaged reputations. In our professional lives, a rushed choice can result in a mismatched career path, stifling our growth and potential. Even in our financial lives, impulsive decisions can lead to debt, financial insecurity, and a lifetime of regret.Furthermore, the cumulative effect of repeated hasty decisions can be devastating. A pattern of impulsive choices can lead to a lifetime of missed opportunities, unrealized potential, and lingering ""what ifs."" In extreme cases, a single rash decision can alter the course of our entire life, leading to a lifetime of regret and ""if onlys.""In conclusion, the wisdom of ""haste makes waste"" is a timeless truth that holds significant relevance in today's fast-paced world. By recognizing the pitfalls of quick decisions and adopting a more thoughtful and deliberate approach, we can avoid the waste and regret that often accompanies hasty choices."
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;The automobile is undoubtedly one of the most significant forms of transportation in our daily lives. With millions of cars on the roads worldwide, it is evident that many people own and use them on a daily basis, highlighting their importance in our lives. The impact of the automobile on our lives extends beyond mere transportation, as it has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with one another.The automobile has made traveling easier and more accessible, enabling people to explore the world beyond their immediate surroundings. With a car, people can travel to distant places, explore new cultures, and experience the beauty of nature. This has not only broadened our horizons but also fostered global understanding and exchange. The automobile has also enabled people to commute to work, school, and other essential destinations, facilitating economic growth and social development.Moreover, the automobile has transformed the way we live and work. With the flexibility to travel whenever and wherever we want, people have more time for leisure activities, personal pursuits, and socializing. The automobile has also enabled the growth of suburbanization, allowing people to live in the outskirts of cities and commute to work, thereby improving their quality of life.In conclusion, the automobile is an integral part of our daily lives, and its significance extends beyond mere transportation. It has enabled us to travel, explore, and experience the world, thereby broadening our perspectives and fostering global understanding. As the world continues to evolve, the automobile is likely to remain a vital part of our lives, shaping the way we live, work, and interact with one another.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;Title: Following in Their Footsteps: The Benefits of Choosing a Job Similar to Your Parents'Choosing a job that is similar to your parents' can be a strategic career move, offering numerous benefits that can propel you towards success. One of the primary advantages of following in your parents' professional footsteps is the invaluable support they can provide. As they are already familiar with the environment and industry, they can offer domain-specific knowledge, industry-related information, and valuable insights that can help you navigate your career more effectively.Parents who work in the same field as their children can provide guidance, mentorship, and networking opportunities that can be instrumental in launching and advancing their careers. They can also offer practical advice on how to overcome common challenges, avoid pitfalls, and capitalize on opportunities. Moreover, their experience and connections in the industry can help their children secure internships, job placements, or valuable recommendations.Some may argue that the job market is constantly evolving, and what worked for their parents may not be applicable today. However, while it is true that the job market has undergone significant changes, the fundamental principles of success in most industries remain the same. Hard work, dedication, and a willingness to learn and adapt are still essential qualities for achieving success. Parents who work in the same field as their children can provide guidance on how to develop these qualities and navigate the changing landscape of their industry.In conclusion, choosing a job that is similar to your parents' can be a wise career decision. The support, guidance, and industry insights they can provide can help you navigate your career more smoothly and achieve success more quickly. By following in their footsteps, you can capitalize on their experience and expertise, and set yourself up for a successful and fulfilling career.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;The remuneration of professional athletes and entertainers is often a topic of heated debate. Many people find it hard to fathom the astronomical sums they earn, and some may argue that the vast chasm between their pay and that of ordinary individuals is unfair. However, from my perspective, I firmly believe that these athletes and entertainers deserve every penny of their substantial earnings.Firstly, a worker's salary is a direct reflection of their competence and the value they bring to their profession. Professional athletes and entertainers are among the crème de la crème in their fields, possessing exceptional skills and talents that captivate millions of fans worldwide. Their hard work, dedication, and passion for their craft have earned them a spot at the pinnacle of their industries. As such, their salaries should mirror their exceptional abilities and the immense entertainment value they provide.Secondly, the high salaries of athletes and entertainers serve as a guarantee for their outstanding performances. With lucrative contracts come immense pressure to deliver results, pushing these individuals to consistently improve and perfect their craft. Moreover, their substantial earnings allow them to invest in top-notch training facilities, coaches, and support staff, further ensuring they stay at the top of their game. This, in turn, benefits fans who get to witness breathtaking displays of athleticism and artistry.Furthermore, the salaries of professional athletes and entertainers have a trickle-down effect, boosting the economy and creating opportunities for others. They often invest in philanthropic endeavors, sponsor aspiring talent, and contribute to the growth of their respective industries.In conclusion, the enormous salaries of professional athletes and entertainers are a testament to their remarkable abilities and the value they bring to the world of sports and entertainment. While the pay gap between them and ordinary individuals may seem vast, it is a reflection of their hard work, dedication, and exceptional talents. They deserve every penny of their earnings, and their success has a positive impact on the world at large.
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;Music and art are often considered essential skills for children to learn, with many parents including them on their must-learn list. In my opinion, this emphasis on music and art education is not only suitable but also highly beneficial for young children.Developing a child's senses through music and art is a lifelong cultivation that is well worth investing in. From a young age, children are naturally curious and receptive to new experiences, making it the perfect time to introduce them to the world of music and art. Learning to play a musical instrument or creating art helps children develop their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and creativity, all of which are essential for cognitive development.Moreover, music and art education can have a profound impact on a child's emotional and social development. Music, in particular, has been shown to have a calming effect on children, reducing stress and anxiety while improving their mood and focus. Art, on the other hand, provides an outlet for children to express themselves, communicating their thoughts and emotions in a healthy and constructive manner.In addition to these benefits, music and art education can also shape a child's temperament and character. By learning to appreciate and create music and art, children develop important life skills such as discipline, perseverance, and self-expression. These skills, in turn, help children develop a more positive and resilient temperament, better equipping them to navigate life's challenges.In conclusion, music and art are essential skills that every child should have the opportunity to learn. By introducing them to music and art at a young age, parents can provide their children with a lifelong cultivation that will nourish their mind, body, and soul. The benefits of music and art education are numerous and far-reaching, making them an invaluable investment in a child's future.
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;Making students interested in a subject is a challenging task for teachers. There are many ways to achieve this, but in my opinion, the best way is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.When students see the relevance of a subject to their everyday lives, they become more engaged and motivated to learn. By explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, teachers can help students make connections between the classroom and the real world. For example, in a math class, a teacher can explain how mathematical concepts such as percentages and ratios are used in shopping and cooking. This helps students to see that math is not just a abstract concept, but a practical tool that they can use in their daily lives.By making these connections, students will have a vivid impression of the subject and become more active in acquiring knowledge. They will start to see the value and importance of the subject, and will be more likely to ask questions, participate in class discussions, and seek out additional learning opportunities. Moreover, when students see the practical application of a subject, they are more likely to remember what they have learned, as they can relate it to their own experiences.Furthermore, explaining how a subject applies to daily life can also help to make the learning process more enjoyable and interactive. Teachers can use real-life examples and case studies to illustrate key concepts, making the subject more accessible and interesting to students. This approach can also help to break down the barrier between the classroom and the outside world, making learning a more holistic and integrated process.In conclusion, I firmly believe that explaining how a subject can help and apply to students' lives outside school is the best way to make them more interested in the subject. By making these connections, teachers can help students to see the value and importance of the subject, and to become more active and engaged learners.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;The 21st century is faced with numerous challenges, but two of the most pressing issues are environmental protection and economic development. Both are crucial to the future and welfare of humanity, and finding a balance between the two is essential. However, in my opinion, tackling environmental problems should take precedence over economic development.The environment is the foundation of human existence, providing us with the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. The degradation of the environment, caused by pollution, deforestation, climate change, and other human activities, poses a significant threat to our very survival. The consequences of environmental neglect are already being felt, with devastating natural disasters, unpredictable weather patterns, and the loss of biodiversity. If we do not take immediate action to protect the environment, the consequences will be catastrophic.On the other hand, economic development is essential for improving the standard of living and reducing poverty. However, economic growth at the expense of the environment is a short-sighted approach. The long-term costs of environmental degradation far outweigh the short-term economic benefits. Moreover, investing in environmental protection can actually drive economic growth, creating jobs and stimulating innovation in fields such as renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and eco-tourism.In conclusion, while both environmental protection and economic development are crucial, the former should take precedence. The future of humanity depends on our ability to protect the environment, and neglecting this responsibility will have dire consequences. By prioritizing environmental protection, we can ensure a sustainable future, create new economic opportunities, and improve the welfare of all people. It is our responsibility to act now and make the necessary sacrifices to safeguard the planet for future generations.
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;The recent surge in environmental concerns has sparked a heated debate about the future of car use. While some individuals believe that personal cars will remain an indispensable part of daily life, others, including myself, foresee a decline in car usage.On one hand, there are valid reasons why people might think that car use will persist. For many, owning a car is a symbol of freedom and independence, providing a convenient means of transportation to work, school, and social events. Moreover, in areas with limited public transportation, cars are often the only viable option. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that many individuals will continue to rely on their personal vehicles.However, I firmly believe that the growing awareness of environmental issues will inevitably lead to a decrease in car use. As people become more conscious of the detrimental impact of greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and urban congestion, they will start to seek alternative modes of transportation. Governments and cities are already investing heavily in sustainable infrastructure, such as bike lanes, public transportation systems, and pedestrian-friendly areas. These initiatives not only reduce carbon emissions but also promote healthier lifestyles and more livable communities.Furthermore, the rise of car-sharing and ride-hailing services, as well as the increasing popularity of electric and hybrid vehicles, indicate a shift towards more environmentally friendly transportation options. As technology continues to improve and costs decrease, these alternatives will become even more appealing to a wider range of consumers.In conclusion, while some people may view personal cars as essential to their daily lives, I am convinced that the growing environmental concerns will lead to a decline in car use.
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;"The university experience is often characterized by a newfound sense of independence, where students are given the freedom to manage their own learning. While this autonomy can be liberating, it also poses a challenge for some students who may not feel the need to attend classes regularly. As long as they can handle the exams, some students may think it's sufficient to simply study alone, bypassing the traditional classroom experience. However, this approach is not only misguided but also detrimental to their overall learning experience.Attending classes is far more effective than studying alone for several reasons. Firstly, classes provide a structured learning environment where students can engage with the material in a more interactive and immersive way. Lectures, discussions, and group work facilitate a deeper understanding of the subject matter, allowing students to ask questions, clarify doubts, and explore different perspectives. In contrast, solo studying can lead to a superficial grasp of the material, with students missing out on the nuances and complexities that a classroom setting can provide.Moreover, attending classes is not just about absorbing information; it's also about developing essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication. By participating in class discussions and engaging with peers, students can hone these skills, which are vital for success in their future careers. Furthermore, attending classes demonstrates a student's commitment to their education and their willingness to take responsibility for their own learning.In this regard, attending classes is not just a matter of personal preference, but a basic responsibility that students should uphold. By shirking this responsibility, students not only jeopardize their own academic success but also undermine the very purpose of university education. In conclusion, while independence is an essential aspect of university life, it should not be used as an excuse to neglect the importance of attending classes. Regular attendance is crucial for effective learning, skill development, and personal growth, making it an indispensable part of the university experience."
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;"The Role of Luck in Success: A MisconceptionThe notion that luck plays a significant role in achieving success is a widely debated topic. Some people firmly believe that luck is the primary driver of success, while others argue that it is a minor factor. As a firm believer in the power of hard work and determination, I strongly disagree with the idea that luck is the primary cause of success.To begin with, when we look at famous and successful individuals, we often find that they are diligent and dedicated people who have put in countless hours of effort to reach their goals. Take, for example, Thomas Edison, who is famously quoted as saying, ""Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration."" His success was not due to luck, but rather his tireless work ethic and perseverance. Similarly, athletes, entrepreneurs, and artists who have achieved greatness have done so through their dedication and passion, not by chance.Furthermore, relying on luck to achieve success is an unreliable and unsustainable strategy. Luck is unpredictable and fleeting, and it is impossible to control or replicate. If we rely solely on luck, we will inevitably be disappointed and disillusioned when it does not materialize. On the other hand, hard work, determination, and resilience are qualities that we can cultivate and control, allowing us to achieve success through our own efforts.In conclusion, while luck may play a small role in success, it is not the primary driver. Instead, it is the diligent and dedicated individuals who put in the time and effort to achieve their goals who truly succeed. By focusing on developing our skills, working hard, and persevering through challenges, we can create our own success, rather than relying on chance."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;The age-old debate about the effectiveness of learning with a teacher versus self-directed learning has sparked intense discussion among educators and learners alike. While some argue that learning with a teacher is the most efficient way to acquire knowledge, others prefer to learn on their own. In my opinion, both methods have their merits, and it ultimately depends on individual preferences and learning styles.On one hand, learning with a teacher can significantly enhance the learning experience. A good and experienced teacher can provide personalized guidance, clarify doubts, and offer valuable feedback. This can prevent confusion and misinterpretation of complex concepts, allowing learners to grasp them more quickly and accurately. Moreover, a teacher can tailor the learning pace to suit the needs of the student, thereby increasing the speed and rate of learning. A teacher can also provide motivation, encouragement, and support, which are essential for learners to stay engaged and focused.On the other hand, I must admit that there are times when I prefer to learn on my own. Self-directed learning allows me to set my own pace, explore topics in-depth, and learn at my own convenience. Without the pressure of a teacher or a classroom, I can focus on areas that interest me the most and delve deeper into the subject matter. Additionally, learning on my own enables me to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as I am forced to navigate through challenges and obstacles independently.In conclusion, while learning with a teacher offers numerous benefits, including increased speed and clarity of learning, I believe that self-directed learning also has its advantages. Ultimately, the most effective learning method is one that strikes a balance between the two. With the guidance of a good teacher and the flexibility of self-directed learning, learners can achieve a deeper understanding of the subject matter and develop essential skills for lifelong learning.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;With the advancement of technology, it is now possible for people to do their work from anywhere, as long as they have the necessary equipment. This has led to an increase in remote work arrangements, where employees work from home or other locations outside of the traditional office setting. While some people may find this arrangement convenient and flexible, I firmly believe that working from home is less efficient and less beneficial than working in an office.One of the main drawbacks of working from home is the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and supervisors. In an office setting, employees are able to easily communicate with each other, ask questions, and clarify any misunderstandings. This is not possible when working from home, where employees are isolated and may miss out on important discussions and decisions.Another disadvantage of working from home is the lack of structure and accountability. In an office, employees are more likely to stay focused and motivated, as they are surrounded by colleagues who are also working. At home, it is easy to get distracted by household chores, TV, or social media, leading to decreased productivity. Additionally, employees who work from home may feel less accountable to their employer, as they are not physically present in the office.Furthermore, employees who work from home are more likely to miss important events and announcements that take place in the office. For example, a boss may make an announcement about a new project or deadline, which may not be communicated to remote workers in a timely manner. This can lead to feelings of disconnection and isolation, as well as missed opportunities for growth and development.In conclusion, while technology has made it possible to work from anywhere, I believe that working from home is less efficient and less beneficial than working in an office. The lack of face-to-face interaction, structure, and accountability, as well as the potential to miss important events and announcements, make office work a more productive and effective arrangement.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;In today's society, the emphasis on conformity often leads individuals to fear standing out from the crowd. However, being different from everyone else is often a hallmark of innovation and progress. Those who dare to be unique have achieved something superior to others, pushing the boundaries of what is possible and leaving a lasting impact.Embracing individuality allows one to create their own value, a value that cannot be taken away by others. This uniqueness is what sets one apart and makes them truly special. Take, for instance, Apple, one of the most popular and prestigious technology companies in the world. Apple's success can be attributed to its willingness to challenge the status quo and think outside the box. By introducing products that were vastly different from what was already available in the market, Apple was able to revolutionize the tech industry and create a loyal customer base.Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, was known for his unconventional approach to design and innovation. He refused to compromise on his vision, even when it meant going against the norm. This refusal to conform to traditional thinking led to the creation of game-changing products like the iPhone and iPad. Today, Apple is a household name, synonymous with innovation and style.In conclusion, being different from everyone else is not something to be feared, but rather something to be celebrated. By embracing our unique qualities and refusing to conform to societal norms, we can create our own value and make a lasting impact. As Apple's success has shown us, being different can be a powerful catalyst for innovation and progress.
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;The world is undergoing rapid transformations, and the challenges faced by the current generation are vastly different from those experienced by the previous one. The dawn of globalization and industrial integration has revolutionized the way we live and work, presenting a multitude of complexities that previous generations never had to navigate.On one hand, the work-related challenges have become increasingly intricate. With the advent of globalization, the job market has become more interconnected, and the competition for jobs has intensified. The rapid pace of technological advancements has also created a high demand for specialized skills, making it essential for individuals to continuously update their skills to remain employable. Furthermore, the gig economy and remote work arrangements have blurred the lines between work and personal life, leading to an always-on culture that can be overwhelming. As a result, the current generation is facing unprecedented pressure to adapt, innovate, and thrive in a highly competitive and dynamic work environment.On the other hand, this generation is grappling with the issue of self-recognition, which was not a significant concern for the previous generation. Social media has created unrealistic expectations and promoted the cult of perfection, leading to increased anxiety, depression, and self-doubt. The constant bombardment of curated and manipulated information has made it difficult for individuals to develop a sense of identity and self-worth. Moreover, the fear of missing out (FOMO) and the pressure to present a perfect online persona have exacerbated the issue of self-recognition, making it challenging for individuals to discern their true passions, values, and goals.In conclusion, the challenges faced by the current generation are distinct and multifaceted. The complexities of the modern work environment and the self-recognition issue are just a few examples of the unique obstacles that this generation must overcome. It is essential for individuals, educators, and policymakers to acknowledge and address these challenges, providing the necessary support and resources to empower this generation to thrive in an ever-changing world.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;"There are numerous perspectives on the characteristics that define successful individuals. While some may argue that traits such as intelligence, charisma, or luck are essential, I firmly believe that one of the primary factors contributing to success is the willingness to take risks and try new things.In my opinion, the ability to step out of one's comfort zone and experiment with novel approaches is a crucial aspect of achieving greatness. By embracing uncertainty and taking calculated risks, individuals can acquire valuable knowledge, skills, and insights that might not have been accessible otherwise. This mindset allows them to navigate unfamiliar territories, adapt to changing circumstances, and innovate in ways that others may not have considered.Moreover, I believe that great success requires taking great risks. Playing it safe and adhering to conventional norms can lead to mediocrity, whereas bold experimentation and risk-taking can lead to groundbreaking discoveries and achievements. Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, inventors, and thought leaders have been known to challenge the status quo and push boundaries, often facing criticism and setbacks along the way.However, it is through these experiences that they refined their ideas, developed resilience, and ultimately achieved their goals. By trying new things and taking risks, successful individuals demonstrate a growth mindset, a willingness to learn from failures, and an unwavering commitment to their vision. This, in turn, enables them to stay ahead of the curve, capitalize on opportunities, and leave a lasting impact on their respective fields.In conclusion, the willingness to try new things and take risks is a fundamental characteristic of successful people. By embracing this mindset, individuals can unlock new possibilities, foster innovation, and propel themselves towards greatness. As the famous saying goes, ""nothing ventured, nothing gained."""
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;**The Importance of People Skills and Hard Work in Achieving Success**In today's competitive job market, it's not just one factor that determines success, but a combination of several skills and qualities. In my opinion, two essential elements that contribute to success in a future job are the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school. Additionally, effective communication is a crucial factor that plays a significant role in achieving success.Relating well to people is a vital skill that can make or break one's career. When we can connect with others, build strong relationships, and communicate effectively, we are more likely to have a wide network of contacts that can open doors to new opportunities. This network can provide valuable advice, introduce us to potential employers, and offer support during challenging times. Moreover, people skills help us to work effectively in teams, resolve conflicts, and negotiate with clients, making us more attractive to potential employers.Studying hard in school is equally important as it lays the foundation for future success. A strong academic record demonstrates our commitment, discipline, and ability to learn and adapt quickly. It also provides us with the knowledge and skills required to perform well in our chosen profession. Employers often look for candidates with a strong academic background, as it indicates a willingness to put in the effort required to succeed.Effective communication is the glue that binds these two skills together. When we can communicate our ideas, thoughts, and feelings clearly and concisely, we can build strong relationships, negotiate effectively, and convey our value to employers. By combining people skills, hard work, and effective communication, we can set ourselves up for success in our future careers. In conclusion, while there are many factors that contribute to success, the ability to relate well to people, studying hard in school, and effective communication are three essential elements that can help us achieve our career goals.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;The influence of advertising on modern society is undeniable, with its pervasive presence shaping our choices in various aspects of life. One area where advertising is often criticized is its perceived impact on unhealthy eating habits. While some argue that advertising is the primary driver of poor dietary choices, I firmly believe that it is not the main culprit. In my opinion, the key to developing healthy eating patterns lies in embracing wholesome diets and exercising self-control.Advertising often gets blamed for promoting unhealthy foods, but it is essential to recognize that individuals have agency over their food choices. Wholesome diets, which emphasize whole, nutrient-dense foods, are the foundation of healthy eating. People who prioritize these diets are less likely to be swayed by advertisements for processed or high-calorie foods. Moreover, self-control plays a crucial role in resisting the allure of unhealthy options, even when they are heavily advertised.Interestingly, advertising may even contribute to healthier eating habits. The growing awareness of the importance of living a healthy lifestyle has led to an increase in advertising for wholesome foods and wellness products. This shift in advertising trends can encourage people to make better choices, such as opting for organic produce or choosing restaurants that offer nutritious options. Furthermore, some companies are using their advertising platforms to promote healthy eating habits, such as highlighting the benefits of balanced diets or partnering with wellness experts to create informative campaigns.In conclusion, while advertising can influence food choices, it is not the primary cause of unhealthy eating habits. The responsibility for developing healthy eating patterns lies with individuals, who must prioritize wholesome diets and exercise self-control. As advertising continues to evolve, it is possible that it will play a more significant role in promoting healthy eating habits, ultimately contributing to a healthier society.
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";The Impact of Television on SocietyTelevision has become an integral part of our daily lives, serving as a valuable tool for education, entertainment, and information dissemination. Since its inception, television has revolutionized the way we learn, relax, and stay updated about current events. However, excessive television viewing has been linked to several negative effects, which can have far-reaching consequences on individuals and society as a whole.On the positive side, television offers a wide range of educational programs that cater to diverse interests and age groups. Documentaries, historical dramas, and science shows can spark curiosity and foster a love for learning among viewers. Television also provides a platform for entertainment, with movies, sitcoms, and reality TV shows offering a welcome respite from the stresses of daily life. Furthermore, news programs and current affairs shows keep viewers informed about local and global events, enabling them to stay abreast of the latest developments.However, excessive television viewing has been associated with several negative effects, particularly among certain individuals. Some people become so engrossed in television that they spend an inordinate amount of time watching TV, often at the expense of other activities, such as exercise, reading, or socializing. This can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity, diabetes, and other health problems. Additionally, some individuals develop unhealthy eating habits, such as eating in front of the TV, which can lead to mindless snacking and poor nutrition.Moreover, excessive television viewing can also have a profound impact on children's cognitive and social development. Studies have shown that children who watch too much TV are more likely to experience attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, social isolation, and decreased academic performance. Parents and caregivers must, therefore, ensure that children maintain a balance between TV viewing and other activities that promote physical and mental well-being.In conclusion, television is a double-edged sword, offering numerous benefits while also posing significant risks. While it can educate, entertain, and inform, excessive viewing can have far-reaching negative consequences. It is essential to maintain a balance between TV viewing and other aspects of life to reap its benefits while minimizing its negative effects.
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;The university student body can be broadly categorized into two distinct groups: those who exhibit a lack of interest in their academic pursuits and those who are diligent and hardworking. While both types of students have their own set of needs, it is essential to recognize the importance of balancing academic and extracurricular activities in fostering a holistic educational experience.Regular physical exercise is widely acknowledged as a crucial component of a healthy and happy lifestyle. Investing a minimum of 30 minutes in physical activity daily can have a profound impact on both physical and mental well-being. However, it is equally important to acknowledge the significance of academic infrastructure, such as libraries and laboratories, in providing students with the necessary resources to excel in their studies.In this context, it is not entirely justifiable to allocate equal amounts of money to academic and physical or social activities. While physical and social activities are essential for the overall development of students, academic infrastructure should be given priority. Libraries and laboratories provide students with the necessary tools and resources to engage in critical thinking, research, and experimentation, which are fundamental to the learning process.Moreover, investing in academic infrastructure can have long-term benefits, such as improving student outcomes and enhancing the reputation of the institution. In contrast, while physical and social activities are important, they can be facilitated through more cost-effective means, such as partnerships with local community centers or outdoor activities that do not require significant investments.In conclusion, while both academic and physical or social activities are essential for university students, it is not prudent to allocate equal amounts of money to both. Academic infrastructure, such as libraries and laboratories, should be given priority, as they provide students with the necessary resources to excel in their studies and have long-term benefits for the institution.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;Attending classes is a vital part of a student's educational journey, offering numerous benefits and a wide range of learning opportunities. While some may argue that attending classes is a necessary evil, others firmly believe that being present in class is the wiser option. This essay will examine the advantages of attending classes, highlighting the benefits of in-person learning and the drawbacks of relying solely on self-study.First and foremost, attending classes provides students with the opportunity to interact with their peers, which is essential for grasping new material. By participating in discussions and reviewing notes with fellow students during free periods in college, students can gain a deeper understanding of complex concepts. This collaborative learning approach enables students to ask questions, clarify doubts, and learn from one another's perspectives, ultimately leading to better academic performance.Another significant advantage of attending classes is the ability to seek help from instructors and peers alike. When faced with challenging problems or difficult topics, students who attend classes can request assistance from their teachers or classmates, receiving immediate feedback and guidance. This support system is invaluable, as it helps students overcome obstacles and stay on track with their studies.Moreover, attending classes fosters a sense of responsibility and accountability, as students are more likely to stay motivated and engaged in their learning when they are physically present in class. Regular attendance also allows students to develop important life skills, such as time management, teamwork, and communication, which are essential for success in their future careers.In conclusion, attending classes offers a multitude of benefits that are hard to replicate through self-study alone. By participating in classes, students can engage with their peers, seek help when needed, and develop valuable life skills. While some may argue that attending classes is a necessary evil, it is clear that being present in class is the wiser option, providing students with a more comprehensive and effective learning experience.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;The advent of modern technology has revolutionized the way we communicate with each other. The use of telephones and email has made a significant impact on our daily lives, making it easier for us to connect with others. In my opinion, these tools have greatly simplified my life, and I will provide several reasons to support this claim.Firstly, telephones and email enable me to directly communicate with the people I need to connect with. Unlike traditional face-to-face communication, which often requires physical presence and coordination of schedules, these tools allow me to reach out to anyone, anywhere, and at any time. With just a few clicks or dialing a number, I can instantly connect with friends, family, colleagues, or business associates, regardless of their geographical location. This convenience has saved me a considerable amount of time and effort, making it easier to stay in touch with people who matter to me.Secondly, I find that telephones and email enable me to express important messages more effectively than face-to-face communication. Sometimes, it can be daunting to convey sensitive or complex information in person, as it may lead to misunderstandings or awkwardness. In contrast, writing an email or speaking over the phone allows me to carefully choose my words, ensuring that my message is conveyed accurately and without misinterpretation. This is particularly useful in situations where clarity and precision are crucial, such as in business or academic settings. By using telephones and email, I can communicate more thoughtfully and avoid potential miscommunications that may arise from face-to-face interactions.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;The contrast between life in big cities and small towns is stark, particularly when it comes to social opportunities and access to advanced medical technologies. In metropolitan areas, residents are spoiled for choice when it comes to socializing with friends and engaging in various leisure activities. The abundance of restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, and theaters provides endless possibilities for entertainment and socialization.In contrast, people living in small towns face a dearth of options, often having only one or two venues to choose from. This limited social scene can make it difficult for residents to maintain a vibrant and diverse social life. The lack of variety can lead to a sense of monotony and isolation, where social interactions become repetitive and stifling.However, the benefits of city living extend far beyond the social realm. Medical technologies, in particular, are far more advanced in large cities. State-of-the-art hospitals, cutting-edge research facilities, and specialized treatment centers offer residents access to the best medical care available. This advantage cannot be overstated, as it can literally be a matter of life and death.In my opinion, the benefits of advanced medical technologies in big cities far outweigh the negative influences of urbanization, such as pollution, noise, and stress. While these drawbacks are undeniable, the prospect of receiving top-notch medical care in times of need makes the trade-off worthwhile. Furthermore, the social opportunities and cultural experiences available in big cities can have a profound impact on one's quality of life, fostering personal growth, creativity, and a sense of community.In conclusion, while small towns have their charm, the advantages of big city living, particularly in terms of social opportunities and medical technologies, make them the more desirable choice for those who value diversity, entertainment, and access to top-notch medical care.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying.

274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;The debate about when children should learn financial responsibility has sparked intense discussion among parents and educators. While some argue that children should learn financial management in adulthood, I firmly believe that children should start learning to manage their own money at a young age.One of the primary reasons for introducing financial literacy to children at a young age is that it helps them develop good spending habits. When children are given a weekly allowance, they learn to prioritize their spending and make smart financial decisions. This helps them understand the value of money and the consequences of impulse purchases. By teaching children to budget and save, parents can help them avoid debt and financial stress in the long run.Another reason for teaching financial responsibility to children at a young age is that it prepares them for independence. As children grow older, they will need to make financial decisions on their own, such as choosing a college, managing student loans, and finding a job. By teaching them financial literacy early on, parents can equip them with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate these complex financial decisions.Additionally, teaching children about money management at a young age can also help them develop a sense of entrepreneurship and financial freedom. When children learn to manage their own money, they can start to explore ways to earn extra income, such as starting a small business or investing in a savings account. This can help them develop a sense of financial independence and motivation to achieve their long-term goals.In conclusion, teaching children to manage their own money at a young age is essential for their financial well-being and independence. By introducing financial literacy early on, parents can help their children develop good spending habits, prepare them for independence, and foster a sense of entrepreneurship and financial freedom.

Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe.

Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture.

The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves.

For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.;Dancing is a universal language that transcends borders and cultures, bringing people together in a shared experience of joy, expression, and celebration. In every country, people dance for various reasons, including entertainment, stress relief, and as an integral part of their cultural heritage.On one hand, dancing is an essential aspect of cultural representation, reflecting the values, beliefs, and traditions of a society. Traditional dances, such as the Japanese Kabuki, the Indian Bharatanatyam, or the African Azonto, are often performed during cultural festivals and ceremonies, showcasing the rich cultural diversity of a nation. These dances not only entertain but also convey the history, mythology, and spirituality of a people, serving as a window into their collective identity.On the other hand, dancing is also a reflection of a civilization's level of sophistication and refinement.

In this sense, dancing is not only a form of entertainment but also a measure of a society's cultural advancement.Moreover, people use dancing as a means of self-expression and entertainment.

276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;The debate over whether understanding ideas and concepts or learning facts is more essential for students has been a longstanding issue in the educational sphere. While some argue that grasping concepts is more crucial, I firmly believe that acquiring factual knowledge has more significant benefits for students' future lives.First and foremost, learning facts in school equips students with the necessary tools to tackle problems in their own lives. When students are well-versed in a wide range of facts, they develop a solid foundation for critical thinking and problem-solving. This enables them to approach challenges with confidence and make informed decisions. For instance, knowing historical dates, geographical locations, or scientific formulas can help students understand the context of real-world issues and make connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. By arming themselves with factual knowledge, students become better equipped to navigate the complexities of life and overcome obstacles.Furthermore, learning facts also has a profound impact on students' social behavior. When students are knowledgeable about various subjects, they become more articulate and confident in their interactions with others. This, in turn, fosters meaningful relationships and effective communication. In social situations, students who possess a broad base of factual knowledge can engage in discussions, share insights, and build connections with others, ultimately enhancing their interpersonal skills. Additionally, knowing facts can also promote cultural competence, allowing students to appreciate and respect differences in opinions and perspectives.In conclusion, while understanding ideas and concepts is undoubtedly important, I firmly believe that learning facts has more far-reaching advantages for students' future lives. By acquiring a wealth of factual knowledge, students develop problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and effective communication, ultimately preparing them for success in their personal and professional lives.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;The debate over the importance of sports and social activities in schools has been a longstanding one, with some arguing that they detract from the primary focus on academics. However, in my opinion, sports and social activities play a vital role in promoting the overall well-being of students.First and foremost, sports have a profound impact on an individual's health and fitness. Regular physical activity not only helps maintain a good body shape but also boosts energy levels and overall health. Participating in sports can help students develop healthy habits, improve their mental health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Moreover, sports teach valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance, which are essential for success in all areas of life.Social activities, on the other hand, provide students with opportunities to interact with their peers, develop social skills, and learn about different cultures and perspectives. By participating in social events, students can broaden their horizons, make new friends, and become more empathetic and open-minded individuals. Social activities also offer a much-needed break from academic pressures, allowing students to unwind, relax, and recharge. Furthermore, social events can foster a sense of belonging and community among students, which is crucial for their emotional and psychological well-being.In conclusion, sports and social activities are not mere extracurricular activities, but rather an integral part of a student's overall education. They provide numerous benefits that complement academic learning, from physical health and social skills to emotional well-being and personal growth. By recognizing the value of sports and social activities, schools can provide students with a more holistic and well-rounded education that prepares them for success in all areas of life.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;The internet is widely regarded as one of the most significant inventions of the past century. It has revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and navigate the world. However, some individuals argue that the internet is also a source of numerous problems, citing issues such as misinformation, cyberbullying, and addiction. While these concerns are valid, I firmly believe that the benefits of the internet far outweigh its drawbacks.One of the most significant advantages of the internet is its ability to provide us with daily necessary information. With just a few clicks, we can access a vast array of knowledge on various topics, from news and current events to educational resources and how-to guides. This has made it easier for people to stay informed and up-to-date on the latest developments in their fields of interest.Moreover, the internet has democratized access to knowledge, enabling people to acquire new skills and expand their understanding of the world. Online courses, tutorials, and educational websites have made it possible for individuals to learn at their own pace, regardless of their geographical location or financial means. This has opened up new opportunities for personal and professional growth, allowing people to enhance their careers and improve their socio-economic prospects.Furthermore, the internet has enabled people to explore the world from the comfort of their own homes. With virtual tours, travel websites, and social media platforms, individuals can now experience different cultures, landmarks, and ways of life without having to physically travel. This has broadened our perspectives, fostered global understanding, and encouraged cultural exchange.In conclusion, while some problems may arise from information on the internet, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. The internet has empowered us with knowledge, connected us to the world, and opened up new opportunities for growth and exploration. As we continue to navigate the complexities of the digital age, it is essential that we harness the internet's potential to create a more informed, connected, and enlightened global community.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;The University: A Hub of Diverse Knowledge and OpportunitiesUniversities are esteemed institutions that equip individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in their chosen professions. While some universities adopt a specialized approach, requiring students to focus on a single subject, I firmly believe that studying multiple subjects is more beneficial. This approach allows students to explore various fields of interest, gain a broader understanding of different subjects, and ultimately, have more options when it comes to choosing their future career path.Studying multiple subjects provides students with the opportunity to discover their true passions and interests. By exposing themselves to various disciplines, students can identify areas where they excel and enjoy learning. This, in turn, fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter and promotes a more engaging learning experience. Moreover, acquiring knowledge in multiple fields enables students to develop a more nuanced and interconnected understanding of the world.In contrast, specializing in a single subject can lead to a narrow and limited perspective. While it is true that specializing can lead to expertise in a particular field, it can also restrict a student's ability to think critically and make connections between seemingly disparate subjects. By studying multiple subjects, students can develop a more holistic understanding of the world and cultivate valuable skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity.Furthermore, studying multiple subjects provides students with a competitive edge in the job market. Employers often seek individuals with a diverse range of skills and knowledge, as they are better equipped to adapt to changing circumstances and approach problems from multiple angles. By studying multiple subjects, students can increase their chances of securing a job and advancing in their chosen career.In conclusion, studying multiple subjects at university is more beneficial than specializing in a single subject. It allows students to explore their interests, gain a broader understanding of different subjects, and ultimately, have more options when it comes to choosing their future career path. By adopting a more diverse and inclusive approach to learning, universities can empower students to succeed in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;In my opinion, the primary focus of any government should be on fulfilling the basic needs of its citizens. These fundamental necessities are the foundation upon which a society's well-being, prosperity, and happiness are built. Among these, I firmly believe that jobs, a good environment, and love within families are the most essential.First and foremost, jobs are a crucial aspect of an individual's life, providing not only financial stability but also a sense of purpose and fulfillment. A government that prioritizes job creation and employment opportunities ensures that its citizens have the means to support themselves and their families. This, in turn, has a ripple effect on reducing poverty, crime, and other social issues that plague many communities.Secondly, a good environment is vital for the health and well-being of a nation's people. This includes access to clean air and water, green spaces, and initiatives that protect natural resources. Governments that invest in environmental conservation and sustainability not only ensure a healthy environment for current generations but also safeguard the future for those to come.Lastly, love and support within families are indispensable for individual development and societal harmony. Families are the building blocks of society, and when they are strong and supported, the entire community benefits. Governments can play a significant role in fostering this through family-friendly policies, support for education, and initiatives that promote family unity and values.In conclusion, addressing the basic needs of jobs, a good environment, and love within families should be at the forefront of any government's agenda. By focusing on these fundamental aspects, governments can lay a solid foundation for a prosperous, healthy, and harmonious society. It is imperative that governments recognize the importance of these basic needs and allocate resources accordingly to ensure a better life for their citizens.

So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me.

282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;The primary function of a teacher in a school setting is to impart knowledge to their students within a limited timeframe. Given the constraints of time, it becomes increasingly difficult for educators to cater to the individual needs of each student in a class. Furthermore, the learning abilities of students vary greatly, with some grasping concepts with ease while others struggle to keep up.In an ideal scenario, teachers would have the luxury of dedicating one-on-one attention to each student, ensuring that every individual has a comprehensive understanding of the material. However, the reality is far from this. With large class sizes and limited teaching hours, teachers are forced to adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, which can be detrimental to students who require extra support or attention.Moreover, the current system of evaluating teachers based on student test results is inherently flawed. It creates an environment where teachers are pressured to focus on students who are likely to perform well, while neglecting those who are struggling. This approach not only does a disservice to the students who need extra help but also undermines the very purpose of education.Rather than judging teachers solely on test results, we should be adopting a more holistic approach to evaluation. This could involve assessing a teacher's ability to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment, their willingness to adapt to the needs of their students, and their dedication to providing individualized attention whenever possible. By shifting our focus away from test results, we can create a more equitable and effective education system that values the unique abilities and needs of every student.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;The notion that good people always receive a happy ending, while bad individuals face punishment, is a common theme in movies and dramas. However, this portrayal of reality is often overly simplistic and misleading. In the real world, good people can, and often do, experience bad endings. This disparity between the idealized world of entertainment and the harsh realities of life can lead to misunderstandings, particularly among young children.Movies and dramas frequently feature storylines where the protagonist, often a morally upright character, triumphs over adversity, while the antagonist, typically a malevolent figure, is punished for their wrongdoings. This formulaic approach to storytelling creates an unrealistic expectation that good deeds are always rewarded and bad behavior is always penalized. However, real life is far more complex and unpredictable. Good people can fall victim to circumstance, illness, or simply bad luck, despite their virtuous nature.It is essential to convey this nuance to young children, to avoid instilling in them a sense of disillusionment and mistrust when faced with the realities of life. By acknowledging that bad things can happen to good people, we can prepare children for the uncertainties of life and teach them to cope with adversity. Moreover, this understanding can foster a more compassionate and empathetic society, where individuals are more willing to lend a helping hand to those in need, regardless of their circumstances.In conclusion, while the notion of good people always receiving a happy ending may be comforting, it is crucial to acknowledge the complexity of real life. By presenting a more balanced view of reality to young children, we can help them develop a more realistic understanding of the world and its challenges, ultimately preparing them to navigate the intricacies of life with greater resilience and compassion.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;The concept of distance learning has gained significant popularity in recent years, and its advantages are undeniable. It offers flexibility, convenience, and accessibility to students who may not have the means to attend traditional classroom settings. However, the idea of replacing normal courses with online courses is a notion that I strongly disagree with.First and foremost, classroom learning provides an irreplaceable social aspect that is essential for students' emotional and psychological development. Interacting with peers and instructors in person fosters communication skills, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities that are difficult to replicate in an online setting. Students learn valuable skills such as conflict resolution, active listening, and empathy through face-to-face interactions, which are crucial in both personal and professional life.Furthermore, classroom learning allows for instant feedback and guidance from instructors, which is often lacking in online courses. In a traditional setting, students can ask questions and clarify doubts immediately, ensuring a better understanding of complex concepts. In contrast, online courses often rely on asynchronous communication, leading to delayed feedback and potential misunderstandings.Additionally, certain subjects require hands-on training and practical experience, which is challenging to provide in an online environment. Laboratory experiments, art classes, and vocational training, for example, require a physical presence and direct supervision, making them less suitable for online courses.In conclusion, while distance learning has its advantages, it should not replace classroom learning entirely. Instead, it can serve as a supplement to traditional courses, offering additional flexibility and convenience to students. By striking a balance between online and offline learning, we can create a more inclusive and effective education system that caters to diverse learning styles and needs.
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;The Journey of Self-Discovery: How Life Experiences Shape My PerspectiveAs I reflect on my life journey, I am reminded of the numerous circumstances that have profoundly impacted my thought process. One of the most significant experiences that have shaped my perspective is studying at a university. The academic environment, with its rigorous coursework and independent learning, has taught me to become a more prudent individual. I have learned to approach problems with a logical and methodical mindset, analyzing each situation before making informed decisions. This newfound prudence has not only improved my academic performance but has also influenced other areas of my life, such as my personal relationships and professional pursuits.Moreover, various experiences have also taught me the importance of self-care and personal well-being. Through trial and error, I have learned to recognize the warning signs of burnout and take proactive measures to maintain my physical and mental health. Simple habits, such as regular exercise, balanced eating, and adequate sleep, have become essential components of my daily routine. Furthermore, I have come to appreciate the value of seeking help when needed, whether it be from friends, family, or professionals. By acknowledging my limitations and being open to support, I have developed a more compassionate and resilient mindset.These experiences have not only changed the way I think but have also empowered me to become a more responsible and self-aware individual. I have come to realize that life is a continuous learning process, and every experience, whether big or small, offers valuable lessons that can shape my perspective and inform my decisions. As I continue on my journey, I remain open to new experiences and challenges, knowing that they will further refine my thought process and shape me into a wiser and more empathetic person.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;In today's increasingly interconnected world, the importance of foreign languages cannot be overstated. As the world becomes more globalized, the ability to communicate in multiple languages has become a highly valued skill. Many people are now pursuing the study of foreign languages, and one effective way to achieve proficiency is by immersing oneself in a foreign environment.I firmly believe that traveling to another country to learn a foreign language is a superior choice for several reasons. Firstly, being surrounded by native speakers and fully immersed in the language allows learners to pick up the nuances and rhythms of the language more naturally. This is particularly true for aspects such as pronunciation, idioms, and colloquial expressions, which are often difficult to master in a classroom setting.Secondly, studying abroad provides learners with ample opportunities to practice their language skills in real-life situations. Whether it's ordering food at a local restaurant, navigating public transportation, or engaging in conversations with locals, learners are constantly applying their language knowledge in practical ways. This not only boosts confidence but also accelerates the learning process.Thirdly, learning a foreign language in its native environment offers a unique cultural perspective that is often lacking in traditional classroom settings. By living and learning in a foreign country, learners gain a deeper understanding of the language's cultural context, including customs, traditions, and historical references. This, in turn, enhances their ability to communicate effectively and authentically with native speakers.In conclusion, studying a foreign language abroad offers a comprehensive and immersive learning experience that is unparalleled in traditional classroom settings. By surrounding oneself with native speakers, practicing language skills in real-life situations, and gaining a deeper cultural understanding, learners can achieve a higher level of language proficiency and truly become proficient in a foreign language.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;When considering a place to call home, there are several factors that play a crucial role in making that decision. Among these, public utilities and surroundings stand out as primary considerations. A place with well-developed public utilities and a pleasant environment can greatly enhance one's quality of life. In my hometown, we are fortunate to have almost all the necessary public utilities to cater to one's needs, making it an attractive place to live. However, one glaring omission that affects the convenience and accessibility of our community is the lack of comprehensive public transportation.While we enjoy access to amenities such as healthcare, education, and recreational facilities, the absence of a reliable public transportation system hampers the full potential of our town. This limitation not only affects residents' daily commutes to work, school, or other essential services but also impacts visitors and tourists who wish to explore our community. The reliance on personal vehicles or limited private transportation options can lead to congestion, air pollution, and higher living costs, detracting from the overall appeal of our hometown.To address this shortcoming, I strongly advocate for the development of a more extensive public transportation network in our community. This could include expanding bus routes, introducing alternative modes of transport such as cycling infrastructure or pedestrian-friendly pathways, and exploring innovative solutions like ride-sharing services or community-led transportation initiatives. Enhancing our public transportation system would not only improve the quality of life for residents but also boost the local economy by attracting more visitors, businesses, and talent.In conclusion, while my hometown boasts an impressive array of public utilities, the pressing need for a robust public transportation system remains. By prioritizing this essential service, we can unlock the full potential of our community, fostering a more sustainable, connected, and vibrant place for all to live and thrive.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;The pursuit of excellence in education is a multifaceted endeavor that requires the input and participation of various stakeholders. One often overlooked yet valuable source of feedback is the students themselves. Seeking opinions from students can significantly augment the performance of teachers and, by extension, the entire educational system. This essay argues that evaluating the performance of teachers and the educational system from students' perspectives is a crucial step towards improving the quality of education.Students, being the direct recipients of education, have firsthand experience with the teaching methods, curriculum, and overall learning environment. Their unique perspective can provide invaluable insights into what works and what doesn't in the classroom. By soliciting their opinions, teachers can gain a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to refine their teaching techniques and adapt to the needs of their students more effectively. For instance, students may highlight areas where they struggle to comprehend complex concepts, prompting teachers to develop more innovative and engaging ways to explain these topics.Moreover, student evaluations can drive systemic changes within the educational system. When students are given the opportunity to assess the quality of education they receive, their feedback can pinpoint broader issues that may not be immediately apparent to educators or administrators. This could include suggestions for improving school facilities, expanding extracurricular activities, or enhancing support services such as counseling and academic advising. By acting on these recommendations, educational institutions can create a more holistic learning environment that supports the academic, emotional, and social development of students.In conclusion, the opinions of students are a vital resource that can significantly enhance the quality of education. By actively seeking and incorporating student feedback, teachers can improve their instructional strategies, and educational systems can undergo transformative changes that better serve the needs of their students. Embracing this participatory approach to education not only fosters a culture of continuous improvement but also empowers students to become active stakeholders in their learning process.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;The preference between working for a small, local company versus a large, multinational corporation is a significant one. While some may prefer the close-knit, community-oriented environment of a small business, I personally believe that working for a large company is the way to go. Not only do large companies often have a wider range of job opportunities available, making it easier to secure employment, but they also typically offer more competitive salaries and benefits.One of the primary reasons I prefer working for a large company is the increased ease of finding employment. Large companies often have a more established and formalized hiring process, making it easier for job seekers to learn about and apply for open positions. In contrast, small companies may not have the same level of visibility or resources to devote to recruitment, making it more difficult for job seekers to find and secure a position.Another advantage of working for a large company is the potential for higher salaries and benefits. Larger companies often have more financial resources available, allowing them to offer more competitive compensation packages to attract and retain top talent. This is particularly important for individuals who value financial stability and security.Finally, I am also drawn to the opportunity to travel and work internationally that large companies often provide. Many multinational corporations have offices and operations around the world, offering employees the chance to work abroad and experience different cultures. As someone who loves traveling and exploring new places, this opportunity is a major perk that small companies may not be able to match.In conclusion, while small companies have their advantages, I believe that the benefits of working for a large company far outweigh those of working for a small one. From the ease of finding employment to the potential for higher salaries and international travel opportunities, large companies offer a more attractive and rewarding work environment.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;"The role of colleges and universities in providing academic skills to individuals cannot be overstated. These institutions have long been the cornerstone of higher education, offering students the opportunity to pursue their academic and professional goals. However, there is an ongoing debate about who should have access to these institutions. Some argue that college and university education should be reserved for top-performing students, while others believe that everyone should have the chance to acquire advanced skills.On one hand, preserving college and university education for good students may seem like a logical approach. After all, these institutions are designed to provide high-level academic training, and it is only natural that those who have demonstrated academic excellence should be given priority. By doing so, we can ensure that the most talented and motivated individuals have the opportunity to reach their full potential and make meaningful contributions to society.On the other hand, denying access to college and university education to anyone who is not considered ""good"" enough can have far-reaching consequences. It can perpetuate inequality and limit social mobility, as those from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have had the same opportunities to develop their academic skills. Moreover, the idea that only good students deserve a college education is based on a narrow definition of intelligence and potential. Many students who may not have excelled in traditional academic settings may still possess unique talents, skills, and experiences that could be nurtured and developed in a college or university environment.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that everyone should have the chance to gain advanced skills through college and university education. By providing access to these institutions, we can foster a more inclusive and equitable society, where individuals from all walks of life can reach their full potential and contribute to the greater good. Ultimately, the goal of higher education should be to empower individuals, regardless of their background or academic record, to pursue their goals and make a positive impact on the world."
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;The Rise of Online Gaming Addiction Among Students: A Cause for ConcernIn recent years, there has been a disturbing trend among students, with a large number of them becoming increasingly obsessed with online computer games. This fixation has led to a decline in their academic performance, as they spend more and more time glued to their screens, neglecting their studies. The consequences of this addiction are far-reaching and have sparked concerns among educators, parents, and policymakers alike.One of the most significant drawbacks of online gaming is that it offers little to no educational value. Unlike outdoor games or other extracurricular activities that promote physical and mental well-being, online gaming is a sedentary and isolating pursuit that fails to impart any meaningful skills or knowledge. In fact, the time spent on these games can be considered time wasted, as it could be better utilized for learning and personal growth.Furthermore, the content of many online games is a cause for concern. A significant majority of these games rely on violent, bloody, or sexual themes to attract and retain players. This exposure to such graphic content can have a desensitizing effect on young minds, leading to a lack of empathy and a distorted view of reality. Additionally, the emphasis on competition and aggression in these games can foster a culture of hostility and negativity among players.The decline in academic performance among students who are obsessed with online gaming is a worrying trend that needs to be addressed. Parents, teachers, and policymakers must work together to raise awareness about the risks associated with online gaming and encourage students to adopt a more balanced lifestyle. By promoting healthy gaming habits and providing alternative activities that promote learning and personal growth, we can help students avoid the pitfalls of online gaming addiction and reach their full potential.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;The Benefits of In-Person Work on Project Quality and EfficiencyIn today's digital age, where remote work and electronic communication have become the norm, it's easy to overlook the importance of in-person work. However, a closer examination reveals that working in person can have a significant impact on the quality and efficiency of projects. One of the primary benefits of in-person work is the reduction of conflicts and misunderstandings amongst team members. When individuals work together in the same physical space, they are able to communicate more effectively, clarify doubts, and resolve issues promptly.Research conducted by Beijing University supports this notion. An experiment showed that when people engage in face-to-face conversations, they are able to reach agreements more quickly. This is likely due to the nonverbal cues, body language, and tone of voice that are lost in digital communication. In-person interactions allow team members to pick up on these subtle signals, which helps to prevent miscommunications and resolve conflicts more efficiently.While email and other digital communication tools are not ideal for collaborative work, they are still better than no communication at all. However, they often lead to delays, misunderstandings, and frustration. In contrast, in-person work enables team members to discuss and resolve issues in real-time, which can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of a project.Furthermore, in-person work fosters a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, which can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction. When team members work together towards a common goal, they are more likely to be invested in the project's success and willing to go the extra mile to ensure its completion.In conclusion, working in person can have a profound impact on the quality and efficiency of projects. By reducing conflicts, improving communication, and fostering teamwork, in-person work can help teams achieve their goals more effectively. While digital communication tools have their place, they should not replace in-person interactions entirely. By striking a balance between the two, teams can reap the benefits of both worlds and produce high-quality results.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;The increasing involvement of university professors in scientific research has sparked a heated debate regarding its impact on education quality. While some fear that this trend may compromise the standards of teaching, I firmly believe that professors should be encouraged to focus primarily on research.In my opinion, the benefits of professors conducting research far outweigh the potential drawbacks. Firstly, research allows professors to stay updated with the latest developments in their field, enabling them to impart cutting-edge knowledge to their students. This not only enhances the learning experience but also prepares students for the rapidly evolving job market. Moreover, research-oriented professors are more likely to inspire their students to think critically and develop problem-solving skills, essential qualities for success in today's fast-paced world.Furthermore, research fosters a culture of innovation and creativity, which can have a positive impact on the academic environment. When professors are actively engaged in research, they bring a sense of excitement and passion to their teaching, making their classes more engaging and interactive. This, in turn, motivates students to explore new ideas and pursue their own research interests.Another significant advantage of professors focusing on research is the potential for knowledge translation. When professors are actively involved in research, they are better equipped to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems, making their teaching more relevant and applicable. This not only benefits students but also contributes to the broader society, as research findings are translated into practical solutions.In conclusion, while some may worry that the increasing involvement of professors in research will compromise education quality, I firmly believe that the benefits of research-oriented professors far outweigh the drawbacks. By encouraging professors to focus primarily on research, universities can foster a culture of innovation, creativity, and excellence, ultimately leading to better-educated and more inspired students.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;As the world becomes increasingly digitized, the way we learn is undergoing a significant transformation. With the rise of online resources and self-directed learning, many students are opting to learn on their own. However, I firmly believe that learning with a teacher is far more beneficial than learning by oneself.One of the primary reasons I prefer to learn with a teacher is that it allows for a more comprehensive learning experience. A teacher can provide personalized guidance, correct mistakes, and offer valuable feedback that helps to reinforce learning. Moreover, a teacher can facilitate discussions, encourage participation, and create a collaborative learning environment that fosters teamwork and communication skills. These essential skills are often overlooked in self-directed learning, where students may focus solely on individual achievement rather than developing their ability to cooperate and work with others.In contrast, students who rely solely on themselves in learning may struggle to improve their ability to cooperate and express their opinions. Without the guidance of a teacher, they may lack the confidence to share their thoughts and ideas, and may not develop the necessary skills to effectively communicate with others. Furthermore, the absence of a teacher's feedback and encouragement can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement, resulting in a less effective learning experience.In conclusion, while self-directed learning has its advantages, I firmly believe that learning with a teacher is essential for a well-rounded education. The benefits of personalized guidance, collaborative learning, and the development of essential skills such as cooperation and communication, make learning with a teacher a more effective and enjoyable experience. As a student, I believe that I can achieve my full potential and become a more confident and competent learner when I have the support and guidance of a qualified teacher.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;"In today's world, it's common to hear people express gratitude for living in the era of high technology. They often praise the numerous benefits and conveniences that technology has brought to our daily lives. However, I believe that this viewpoint overlooks the complexities that technology has introduced. In my opinion, technology has indeed made our lives more complicated, and I'd like to highlight a couple of reasons and examples that support this claim.Firstly, technology has significantly increased the pace of life, leading to a sense of perpetual busyness and stress. With the constant influx of notifications, emails, and social media updates, people are now expected to be available and responsive 24/7. This has created an environment where individuals feel pressured to be constantly ""on"" and connected, leaving little time for relaxation, reflection, or genuine human interaction. For instance, the rise of remote work has blurred the lines between work and personal life, making it challenging for people to disconnect and maintain a healthy work-life balance.Secondly, technology has also introduced a multitude of choices and decisions, leading to a state of information overload. With the internet at our fingertips, we are now bombarded with a vast array of options and opinions, making everyday decisions increasingly complex. For example, choosing a simple product online can become a daunting task, with countless reviews, ratings, and comparisons to consider. This abundance of information has led to a phenomenon known as ""analysis paralysis,"" where individuals become overwhelmed and struggle to make decisions.In conclusion, while technology has undoubtedly brought many benefits and improvements to our lives, it is essential to acknowledge the complications it has introduced. The relentless pace of life and the abundance of choices have contributed to a sense of overwhelm and stress that many people experience today. As we continue to navigate the complexities of the digital age, it is crucial to recognize these challenges and strive for a balance between harnessing the benefits of technology and maintaining a sense of simplicity and well-being."
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";Classroom learning has been the cornerstone of education for centuries, and for good reason. Despite the rise of online classes, it remains the most effective way to provide education. One of the primary advantages of classroom learning is that it instills a sense of discipline and responsibility in students. In a traditional classroom setting, students are required to complete their study work on time, which helps them develop essential time management skills. This ability to prioritize tasks, manage time, and meet deadlines is crucial in all aspects of life, and classroom learning provides students with the perfect opportunity to hone these skills.Moreover, classroom learning provides students with the benefit of direct interaction with professors, who play a vital role in the educational process. Professors are not only knowledgeable in their fields but also experienced in teaching and mentoring. They are able to provide valuable information, guidance, and feedback, which helps students to better understand complex concepts and ideas. In a classroom setting, students can ask questions, engage in discussions, and receive immediate feedback, which enhances their learning experience.In contrast, online classes often lack the personal touch and human interaction that is essential for effective learning. While online classes may offer flexibility and convenience, they can also lead to procrastination, distraction, and a lack of motivation. Classroom learning, on the other hand, provides students with a structured and supportive environment that encourages them to stay focused, motivated, and engaged.In conclusion, classroom learning is the best way to provide education due to its ability to instill discipline, time management skills, and provide direct interaction with professors. While online classes have their advantages, they cannot replace the benefits of a traditional classroom setting. As such, educators and policymakers should prioritize classroom learning as the primary mode of education, ensuring that students receive the best possible education and are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in all aspects of life.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";The concept of teenagers taking up part-time jobs while pursuing their studies has been a topic of debate among many. While some argue that it can be detrimental to their academic performance, I firmly believe that it is beneficial for teenagers to engage in part-time employment alongside their studies.First and foremost, having a part-time job teaches teenagers valuable life skills such as time management. Balancing work and academic responsibilities requires discipline and organization, which are essential skills for success in any field. By managing their time effectively, students can prioritize their tasks, meet deadlines, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.Moreover, part-time jobs provide students with hands-on experience in money management. Earning a steady income allows them to budget, save, and make smart financial decisions. This skill will benefit them in the long run, as they will be able to manage their finances effectively, avoiding debt and financial stress.Another significant advantage of part-time employment is the development of interpersonal skills. Students learn to communicate effectively with colleagues, customers, and clients, which enhances their ability to convince people through their words. This skill is crucial in various aspects of life, including academics, career, and personal relationships.Lastly, part-time jobs provide students with a sense of financial independence and responsibility. By earning their own money, they can contribute to their family's income, alleviating some of the financial burdens on their parents. This not only boosts their self-esteem but also fosters a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the value of money.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is beneficial for teenagers to take up part-time jobs while pursuing their studies. The skills and values they acquire through part-time employment will benefit them in the long run, preparing them for a successful and responsible life.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;In today's interconnected world, the importance of learning a foreign language cannot be overstated. With the rise of globalization, it is highly likely that an individual will interact with foreigners at some point in their lifetime. Whether it is for business, education, or personal travel, speaking a foreign language can greatly enhance one's experience and opportunities. As a result, it has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language.In my opinion, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. Firstly, learning a language in one's own country provides a more comfortable and familiar environment, allowing learners to focus on the language itself rather than adjusting to a new culture. Additionally, learning a foreign language at home allows individuals to access a wide range of resources and support systems, such as language schools, tutors, and language exchange programs. This support network can greatly facilitate the learning process and help learners overcome any challenges they may encounter.Moreover, learning a foreign language in one's own country can also be more cost-effective and convenient. Rather than traveling abroad to study a language, learners can take advantage of local language classes and resources, saving time, money, and effort. Furthermore, learning a foreign language at home can also enable individuals to balance their language studies with other responsibilities, such as work or family obligations. In conclusion, as the world becomes increasingly interconnected, learning a foreign language has become a vital skill for anyone looking to engage with the global community. By learning a foreign language in one's own country, individuals can access the resources and support they need to succeed, while also enjoying the convenience and comfort of learning at home.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;The debate over whether a single long vacation or several small breaks is more beneficial for students has been ongoing for quite some time. While many people advocate for a one long vacation system, arguing that it allows students to start their academic year with renewed energy and enthusiasm, I firmly believe that several small breaks throughout the year are more advantageous for students' academic well-being.First and foremost, having several small breaks scattered throughout the year helps to keep stress levels low among students. The traditional long vacation system, where students have a prolonged break followed by an intense period of academic rigor, can often lead to burnout and exhaustion. In contrast, frequent breaks provide students with regular opportunities to recharge, refocus, and return to their studies with a clear mind and renewed motivation. This, in turn, enables them to approach their academic work with greater enthusiasm and dedication.Moreover, several small breaks allow students to pace themselves better and maintain a healthy work-life balance. With regular breaks, students can plan their time more effectively, allocate sufficient time for studying, and still have time for extracurricular activities, socializing, and personal interests. This balance is essential for students' overall development and helps prevent the buildup of stress and anxiety that can come with prolonged periods of academic pressure.Additionally, frequent breaks can also help to prevent the loss of momentum that often occurs when students return to school after a long break. With several small breaks, students are able to quickly get back into the swing of things, retaining the knowledge and skills they had previously acquired. This can lead to a smoother transition and greater continuity in their academic progress.In conclusion, while a single long vacation may provide students with a much-needed break, I firmly believe that several small breaks throughout the year are more beneficial for students' academic well-being. By providing regular opportunities for rest, relaxation, and rejuvenation, these breaks help to keep stress levels low, promote a healthy work-life balance, and maintain momentum in students' academic pursuits.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";At the age of nearly thirty, I had the privilege of achieving one of my most cherished goals – winning a medal. This experience not only brought me immense joy and satisfaction, but also taught me a valuable lesson that I believe is essential for everyone to learn. The lesson is simple yet profound: no matter what your age or circumstances, it is never too late to pursue your goals, and perseverance is key to achieving them.As I reflect on my journey to winning the medal, I am reminded of the countless hours, days, and months I spent preparing for it. There were times when I felt like giving up, when my body ached from exhaustion and my mind was clouded with self-doubt. But I did not let those feelings deter me. Instead, I drew upon my inner reserves of strength and determination, and pushed through the challenges.Looking back, I realize that my success was not just about the physical or mental effort I put in, but also about my unwavering commitment to my goal. I had set my sights on winning the medal, and I was willing to do whatever it took to make it happen. This experience taught me that with persistence, hard work, and a clear vision, anyone can achieve their goals, regardless of their age or background.My experience has also shown me that success is not solely the domain of the young or the gifted. It is available to anyone who is willing to put in the effort and persevere through obstacles. As I look around, I see people of all ages and backgrounds achieving their goals, and I am reminded that it is never too late to start working towards your dreams.In conclusion, my experience of winning a medal at the age of nearly thirty has taught me that with persistence, hard work, and determination, anyone can achieve their goals.
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;The Saving Conundrum: Why Developing a Savings Habit is Crucial in Today's WorldIn recent years, a disturbing trend has emerged in developed countries - a low savings rate among its citizens. A significant majority of people in these countries have abandoned the traditional practice of saving a portion of their earnings, opting instead to spend their income immediately or even taking loans to finance their expenses. This behavior is alarming, to say the least, and in my opinion, highlights the importance of saving some part of one's earnings.The primary reason why saving is essential is that it allows individuals to prepare for the uncertainties of the future. No one can predict with certainty what the future holds, and unexpected expenses or financial setbacks can arise at any moment. By setting aside a portion of their earnings, individuals can create a safety net that provides them with a sense of financial security and peace of mind. This fund can be used to cover unexpected expenses, such as medical emergencies or car repairs, or even to take advantage of investment opportunities that may arise.Moreover, saving can also help individuals achieve their long-term financial goals, such as buying a house, funding their children's education, or retiring comfortably. By developing a savings habit, individuals can make steady progress towards these goals, even if it's just a small amount each month.In contrast, spending all of one's earnings or taking loans to finance expenses can lead to financial stress and debt. This can have serious consequences, including damage to one's credit score, reduced financial flexibility, and even bankruptcy.In conclusion, saving some part of one's earnings is crucial in today's world. By setting aside a portion of their income, individuals can prepare for the uncertainties of the future, achieve their long-term financial goals, and avoid financial stress and debt. It is essential that individuals prioritize saving and make it a habit to ensure a secure financial future.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;The past few decades have witnessed a remarkable transformation in the way we live our lives, thanks to the advent of modern technologies and globalization. The world has become smaller, and the pace of life has accelerated exponentially. While this rapid progress has brought numerous benefits, I firmly believe that it is essential to adopt a slower pace of life, as the consequences of living in a perpetual hurry can be detrimental to our overall well-being.First and foremost, living life on the fast lane is incredibly stressful. The constant pressure to meet deadlines, respond to emails, and keep up with the demands of our increasingly complex world can take a toll on our mental and physical health. Research has shown that chronic stress can lead to anxiety, depression, and a weakened immune system, making us more susceptible to illnesses. In contrast, a slower pace of life allows us to breathe, relax, and recharge, enabling us to maintain a healthy work-life balance.Moreover, a fast-paced life often leads to a lack of mindfulness and appreciation for the present moment. When we are always in a rush, we tend to overlook the beauty and simplicity of life, neglecting our relationships, hobbies, and personal growth. By slowing down, we can cultivate a greater sense of awareness, gratitude, and contentment, allowing us to live more intentionally and authentically. Additionally, a slower pace of life can foster creativity, innovation, and problem-solving, as a calm and clear mind is better equipped to think critically and outside the box.In conclusion, while modern technologies and globalization have undoubtedly transformed our lives, it is crucial to recognize the importance of living life at a slower pace. By doing so, we can mitigate the negative effects of stress, cultivate mindfulness, and foster a more balanced, creative, and fulfilling life.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;The world's population has been steadily increasing over the past centuries, reaching a milestone that has never been seen before. For the first time in history, the global population has surpassed seven billion people. This unprecedented growth has put a significant strain on the natural environment, leading to devastating consequences for the ecosystem.One of the most notable effects of human activity is the destruction of natural habitats such as forests, jungles, and lakes. These ecosystems play a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of nature, providing homes for countless species of plants and animals. However, as we continue to expand our urban areas, agricultural lands, and industrial sites, we are encroaching upon these habitats, leading to their destruction. This not only results in the loss of biodiversity but also disrupts the intricate web of relationships within the ecosystem.A stable and sustainable environment is essential for maintaining favorable weather conditions. However, our behavior is having a profound impact on the weather patterns of our planet. Pollution, a direct result of human activity, is releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change. This, in turn, is causing extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves to become more frequent and intense.The consequences of our actions are far-reaching and have severe implications for the future of our planet. It is imperative that we take immediate action to mitigate the effects of our behavior on the environment. This can be achieved through sustainable practices such as reducing our carbon footprint, conserving water, and preserving natural habitats. By working together, we can ensure a healthy and thriving planet for generations to come.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;The debate about whether students should be required to attend classes or not has been a longstanding one. Some argue that mandatory attendance is essential for academic success, while others believe that it should be optional, allowing students to take ownership of their learning. In my opinion, at the university level, students possess sufficient maturity to make their own choices, and thus, attendance should not be compulsory.On one hand, attending classes can sometimes be a waste of time. We have all experienced those tedious lectures where the lecturer drones on and on, reading verbatim from the textbook, without adding any valuable insights or engaging the students in any meaningful way. In such cases, students may find themselves daydreaming or struggling to stay awake, making the entire experience unproductive. Moreover, with the advancement of technology, many courses offer online resources and materials that can be accessed at any time, making physical attendance unnecessary.On the other hand, some lecturers are exceptional in delivering lectures in an informative and interesting manner. They possess the ability to captivate their audience, make complex concepts seem simple, and inspire critical thinking. In such cases, attending classes can be highly beneficial, allowing students to engage with the material, ask questions, and clarify doubts. Furthermore, classes provide opportunities for students to interact with their peers, share ideas, and learn from one another.In conclusion, at the university level, students have demonstrated sufficient maturity to take responsibility for their own learning. Therefore, attendance should not be mandatory. Instead, students should be given the freedom to choose whether or not to attend classes, allowing them to prioritize their time and energy on activities that truly enhance their academic experience. By doing so, students can optimize their learning outcomes and develop essential life skills, such as time management, self-motivation, and accountability.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;In today's world, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, making many people ponder over the question - does technology make life simpler or more complicated? While some argue that technology has added complexity to our lives, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks, making our lives simpler and more convenient.On one hand, it is true that technology has introduced new complexities. For instance, the constant stream of information from social media, emails, and notifications can be overwhelming, leading to mental fatigue and decreased productivity. Moreover, the need to constantly update and maintain our devices, software, and apps can be frustrating and time-consuming. However, these drawbacks pale in comparison to the numerous benefits that technology has brought into our lives.Technology has revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. With the internet at our fingertips, we can access a vast amount of information, connect with people worldwide, and complete tasks with unprecedented speed and efficiency. Online shopping, food delivery, and ride-hailing apps have made our daily lives more convenient, saving us time and effort. Moreover, technology has enabled remote work, allowing people to work from anywhere, at any time, providing flexibility and work-life balance. Medical advancements, such as telemedicine and health monitoring apps, have also improved our healthcare and well-being.Furthermore, technology has enabled instant access to education, entertainment, and news, making our lives more enriching and enjoyable. We can learn new skills, watch movies, and stay updated on current events with just a few clicks. In conclusion, while technology may have introduced some complexities, its benefits in terms of convenience, accessibility, and efficiency far outweigh its drawbacks. Ultimately, technology has made our lives simpler, more convenient, and more enjoyable, and its continued advancements will only continue to improve our lives.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";The mass media, including television and newspapers, play a significant role in shaping the fabric of our society. However, it is a well-known fact that the media often focus on superficial aspects of life, rather than delving into more substantial and meaningful issues. This is primarily driven by the desire to increase audience and readership, as the lives of famous individuals have proven to be a lucrative draw.The constant coverage of celebrity news, scandals, and gossip has created a culture that prioritizes appearance and sensationalism over depth and substance. We live in a society where the most important thing is often perceived to be how one looks, rather than what one achieves or contributes. The media's preoccupation with famous people's lives has contributed to this phenomenon, as it perpetuates the idea that fame and material success are the ultimate goals.This emphasis on superficiality has far-reaching consequences. It creates a society that values style over substance, where individuals are more concerned with projecting a certain image than with actual accomplishments. Furthermore, it distracts from more pressing issues that require attention and discussion, such as social inequality, environmental degradation, and political injustices.Moreover, the media's focus on celebrity culture has also led to the normalization of gossip and rumor-spreading. This has resulted in a culture where people are more interested in discussing the personal lives of others, rather than engaging in meaningful conversations about issues that affect us all.In conclusion, the mass media's preoccupation with superficial aspects of life, particularly the lives of famous individuals, has contributed to a society that prioritizes appearance and gossip over substance and depth. It is imperative that we recognize the impact of this phenomenon and strive to create a culture that values meaningful discussion and intellectual pursuits over the mundane and the superficial.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;The place where one grows up is often referred to as their hometown, and for me, this place is truly special. Born and raised in a small town, I have had the privilege of developing strong roots and a sense of belonging that I cherish deeply. One of the greatest advantages of living in this charming town is the close-knit community that it fosters. I have been fortunate enough to form lasting friendships with people from all walks of life, and the relationships I have built here are genuinely meaningful.Another aspect of my hometown that I thoroughly enjoy is the relaxed pace of life, which is reflected in the town's gentle traffic. Unlike the chaos and congestion that often characterizes larger cities, our town's roads are peaceful and easy to navigate. This not only makes commuting a breeze but also contributes to a more serene atmosphere, allowing residents to feel more at ease.The natural environment of our town is also a significant factor in my affection for it. Surrounded by lush greenery and picturesque landscapes, our town offers a unique blend of natural beauty and small-town charm. The air is fresh, the water is clean, and the overall quality of life is excellent, making it an ideal place to live and thrive.In today's fast-paced world, where people are increasingly mobile and often find themselves moving from one place to another, I strongly believe that staying in one place has its advantages. For one, it allows individuals to develop a sense of continuity and stability, which is essential for building strong relationships and a sense of community. Moreover, staying in one place enables people to develop a deeper understanding of their surroundings and to feel a greater sense of belonging, which can lead to a more fulfilling life.In conclusion, my hometown is a place that I hold very dear to my heart. The strong friendships, relaxed pace of life, and beautiful environment all combine to make it a truly special place. I feel grateful to have grown up here and look forward to continuing to live and contribute to this wonderful community.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;Living arrangements play a significant role in shaping the overall university experience. Two distinct options are available to students: residing in a dormitory or living off-campus. Each choice offers unique advantages that cater to different aspects of a student's life.Living in a dormitory helps students become acclimated to the academic environment of the university. Being in close proximity to campus resources, such as libraries and study spaces, facilitates a smoother transition into university life. Moreover, dormitories provide students with the opportunity to interact with peers from diverse backgrounds, fostering a sense of community and camaraderie. This social aspect of dorm life can be particularly beneficial for students who are new to the university setting, as it allows them to establish a support network and navigate the challenges of higher education.On the other hand, living off-campus prepares students for the realities of real life. By assuming responsibility for their own living arrangements, students can develop essential life skills, such as time management, budgeting, and independence. For instance, students who live off-campus must learn to prioritize tasks, manage their schedules effectively, and maintain a high level of punctuality. Additionally, living with roommates or in a shared accommodation setting promotes cooperation, conflict resolution, and communication skills. These skills are invaluable in the long term, as they equip students with the ability to thrive in a variety of environments and situations.In conclusion, both dormitory and off-campus living arrangements offer distinct benefits that cater to different aspects of a student's life. While living in a dormitory facilitates a smooth transition into university life, living off-campus prepares students for the realities of real life by fostering independence, responsibility, and essential life skills.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;The ideal goal of achieving success and stability in one's career and life often requires a delicate balance between speed and risk. While working at a rapid pace can be beneficial in many ways, it also carries inherent risks that must be carefully managed. In today's fast-paced world, working fast yet risky has become a necessary evil, and many individuals are embracing this approach to achieve their goals.One of the primary advantages of working quickly is that it allows individuals to take on more tasks and responsibilities. When people work rapidly, they have more chances to study and expand their skill set, which is essential in today's competitive job market. By completing tasks efficiently, individuals can free up time to pursue other opportunities, such as learning new skills or taking on additional projects. This, in turn, can lead to greater career advancement and financial stability.In fact, many people are now working in two or three firms in a week, a phenomenon that has become increasingly common due to the rising costs of living. By working rapidly and efficiently, individuals can manage multiple jobs and projects simultaneously, which is often necessary to make ends meet. This approach requires a high level of organization and time management, but for those who can master it, the rewards can be significant.On the other hand, working slowly can be a significant hindrance in today's fast-paced world. Individuals who are unable to keep up with the demands of their job or industry may find themselves struggling to handle even the most basic tasks. In contrast, those who are able to work quickly and efficiently are often better equipped to handle multiple tasks and responsibilities, which is essential for career advancement.In conclusion, working fast yet risky has become a necessary approach in today's competitive world. While it carries inherent risks, the benefits of working rapidly, including the ability to take on more tasks and responsibilities, are undeniable. By embracing this approach, individuals can achieve greater career advancement, financial stability, and success.
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;The traditional notion that university students must pass an exam to prove their worth before attending classes has been a long-standing practice. However, from my perspective, this approach is not only outdated but also limiting. I firmly believe that students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing an exam.One of the primary reasons for this is that students are not constantly experts in every part of a subject. University students come from diverse backgrounds and have varying levels of knowledge and experience. Forcing them to pass an exam before attending classes puts undue pressure on those who may not have had the same opportunities or exposure to certain subjects. It assumes that all students have a uniform level of understanding, which is simply not the case.Moreover, attending classes is an essential part of the learning process. Students can learn from lectures, discussions, and interactions with professors and peers, even if they are not experts in the subject matter. In fact, being in a classroom environment can help students fill knowledge gaps and gain a deeper understanding of the subject. By denying students the opportunity to attend classes until they pass an exam, universities are essentially depriving them of a valuable learning experience.Furthermore, this approach can be counterproductive. Students who are struggling with a particular subject may need the support and guidance that classes provide. By forcing them to pass an exam before attending classes, universities may inadvertently create a self-perpetuating cycle of failure.In conclusion, while exams can be a useful tool for assessing knowledge, they should not be a barrier to entry for university students. By allowing students to attend classes without the prerequisite of passing an exam, universities can provide a more inclusive and supportive learning environment. This approach recognizes that students are not experts in every part of a subject and that attending classes is an essential part of the learning process.
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;The Importance of University Education and Orienting StudentsUniversity education is a vital part of one's life, shaping their future and preparing them for the competitive world. As institutions of higher learning, universities have a significant role in orienting students to achieve their full potential. The question remains, however, what is the best way to orient students for success?One might argue that raising the salaries of professors is the key to effective student orientation. After all, professors are the backbone of any educational institution, responsible for imparting knowledge and guiding students. However, I firmly believe that this approach is misguided. While professors are indeed essential, the primary focus of universities should always be on the students.Rather than increasing professors' salaries, I propose that resources should be allocated towards improving facilities and updating educational resources. Well-equipped libraries, state-of-the-art laboratories, and modern classrooms are essential for creating a conducive learning environment. Furthermore, investing in digital resources, such as online platforms and educational software, can enhance the learning experience and provide students with the skills they need to succeed in the digital age.By prioritizing student-centric investments, universities can create an environment that fosters academic excellence, creativity, and innovation. Moreover, this approach can also lead to a more holistic education, where students are not only equipped with theoretical knowledge but also with practical skills and real-world experiences. Ultimately, the goal of university education is to empower students with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to succeed in their chosen careers and make meaningful contributions to society.In conclusion, while professors are crucial to the educational process, the best way to orient students is to focus on creating an environment that supports their academic, personal, and professional growth. By investing in facilities and resources, universities can provide students with the tools they need to succeed, setting them up for a lifetime of learning, achievement, and success.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;The notion of how pets should be treated has sparked a contentious debate among animal lovers and skeptics alike. While some people firmly believe that pets should be accorded the same level of care and affection as family members, others remain convinced that they are merely animals, lacking the cognitive abilities to think and feel like humans do. However, it is essential to recognize the multifaceted roles that pets play in our lives, which render them more than just mere animals.First and foremost, pets have a unique capacity to form emotional bonds with their human companions. They are, in essence, our friends, offering companionship, solace, and a listening ear. Unlike some individuals who may be indifferent or inattentive, pets possess the remarkable ability to listen attentively, as if absorbing every word we utter. This distinctive quality enables us to form profound connections with them, often rivaling those we share with certain human beings. By acknowledging their capacity for emotional understanding, we can no longer simply view them as mere animals.Furthermore, pets have proven to be incredibly useful in a variety of contexts. A case in point is the growing popularity of pet therapy. This innovative approach has been increasingly employed in various settings, such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and schools, to provide comfort, stress relief, and emotional support. The therapeutic benefits of interacting with pets have been extensively documented, highlighting their potential to positively impact human wellbeing. This utilitarian aspect of pet ownership underscores their value beyond mere companionship, demonstrating their capacity to make tangible contributions to our lives.In conclusion, the idea that pets are nothing more than animals is a narrow and misguided perspective. By recognizing their role as friends, confidants, and contributors to our wellbeing, we can foster a more inclusive and compassionate understanding of their place in our lives. Ultimately, it is crucial that we acknowledge and appreciate the multifaceted roles that pets play, treating them with the respect, care, and affection they rightfully deserve.
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;The allure of big cities has always been a magnetic force, drawing me in with its vibrant energy and endless possibilities. For me, the preference to live in bigger cities over small ones is not merely a matter of personal taste, but rather the culmination of numerous factors that have shaped my perspective.First and foremost, I am captivated by the excitement that big cities exude. The dynamic environment, teeming with people from all walks of life, is a rich tapestry that I find irresistible. From the hustle and bustle of daily life to the eclectic mix of cultures, art, and entertainment, big cities offer a kaleidoscope of experiences that are simply not replicable in smaller towns. Living in a big city is akin to being part of a perpetual motion, where every day brings new encounters, new discoveries, and new opportunities.Beyond the thrill of city living, I am also drawn to the vast array of career opportunities that big cities provide. The concentration of industries, companies, and innovation hubs in urban centers creates a hotbed of professional growth and advancement. In contrast, small towns often lack the scale and diversity of industries, limiting the scope of career progression and earning potential. The prospect of higher income and greater job security is a significant factor in my preference for big cities.Furthermore, the diversity and anonymity of big cities also offer a level of freedom and flexibility that is hard to find in smaller communities. Whether it's pursuing unconventional hobbies, exploring alternative lifestyles, or simply enjoying the anonymity of being one among many, big cities provide an environment that is conducive to self-expression and personal growth.In conclusion, my preference for big cities over small ones is rooted in the excitement, opportunities, and freedom that they offer. While small towns may have their own charm, I firmly believe that the urban experience is unparalleled in its ability to inspire, challenge, and transform individuals.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";The age-old debate between preserving historic and traditional buildings versus constructing new ones has been a longstanding conundrum for governments around the world. While some argue that preserving our cultural heritage is of utmost importance, I firmly believe that the government's primary consideration should be the construction of new buildings that meet the basic needs of its citizens.In today's world, the need for adequate housing is more pressing than ever. With the global population projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, the demand for housing is skyrocketing. Governments must prioritize building constructions that can accommodate the growing population, providing citizens with a decent place to live. This is not only a matter of comfort but also a basic human right. Without a stable and secure shelter, people cannot live a harmonious life, and their overall well-being is compromised.New building constructions offer a range of benefits that historic preservation cannot match. For instance, new buildings can be designed with energy efficiency and sustainability in mind, reducing the strain on the environment and promoting a healthier living space. Additionally, new constructions can be built with modern safety features, reducing the risk of accidents and ensuring a safer living environment.Furthermore, prioritizing new building constructions can also stimulate economic growth. By providing citizens with affordable and decent housing, governments can boost consumer spending, create jobs, and stimulate local economies. In contrast, preserving historic buildings, while culturally valuable, may not have the same economic benefits.In conclusion, while preserving historic and traditional buildings is important, I firmly believe that governments should prioritize building new constructions that meet the basic needs of their citizens. Providing people with a decent place to live is essential for their well-being and happiness. By prioritizing new building constructions, governments can create a more harmonious and prosperous society, where citizens can thrive and reach their full potential.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;Life is full of ups and downs, and it's inevitable that we face difficult experiences at some point. While these experiences may seem insurmountable at the time, I firmly believe that they ultimately become important lessons for the future. In fact, I would argue that every tough experience we face plays a crucial role in shaping us into stronger, more resilient individuals.One of the primary reasons I agree with this statement is that every tough experience makes us more skilled and improves our decision-making. When we encounter obstacles, we are forced to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions. This process of problem-solving helps us develop valuable skills such as critical thinking, adaptability, and resourcefulness. As we navigate through challenges, we learn to analyze situations more effectively, weigh our options carefully, and make informed decisions. These skills, in turn, enable us to tackle future challenges with greater ease and confidence.Another reason I believe that difficult experiences are important lessons for the future is that they make us robust and strong, often unknowingly. When we face adversity, our initial response may be one of fear, anxiety, or frustration. However, as we work through these emotions and find ways to overcome the challenges, we begin to develop a sense of resilience. This resilience is not always immediately apparent, but it lies beneath the surface, waiting to be tapped into when we need it most. As we accumulate more difficult experiences, we build a reservoir of emotional strength that enables us to cope with an increasingly wider range of challenges.In conclusion, I firmly believe that our life seems tough at the time, but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. Every tough experience makes us more skilled and improves our decision-making, while also making us robust and strong, often unknowingly. By embracing these experiences and learning from them, we can develop the skills, resilience, and strength needed to navigate life's challenges with greater ease and confidence.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";The debate about whether drivers should be charged an extra fee during rush hours has sparked intense controversy. Critics argue that such a fee is necessary to deter drivers from contributing to the exorbitant use of oil and adding to the congestion on the roads. They contend that drivers who choose to drive during peak hours are being selfish, as they are aware of the traffic conditions, yet still insist on driving, thereby worsening the situation. However, I firmly believe that imposing an additional fee on drivers during rush hours is not a justifiable solution.From another perspective, traffic jams are a natural phenomenon that nobody can completely avoid or eradicate. They are an inevitable outcome of a large number of vehicles on the road at the same time. It is not entirely within the drivers' control to avoid contributing to the congestion, as they may have no alternative but to drive during peak hours due to work or other commitments. Furthermore, traffic jams can occur due to various factors such as road accidents, construction, or inclement weather, which are beyond the drivers' control.Moreover, charging drivers an extra fee during rush hours may not necessarily solve the problem of congestion. It may lead to a new set of issues, such as increased financial burden on commuters, which could disproportionately affect low-income families who rely on their vehicles for daily transportation. Instead of imposing a fee, governments and traffic authorities should focus on finding alternative solutions to mitigate traffic congestion, such as improving public transportation systems, optimizing traffic light timings, and investing in intelligent transportation systems.In conclusion, while I understand the concerns about the environmental impact of driving during rush hours, I do not think that charging drivers an extra fee is a fair or effective solution. It is essential to consider the complexities of the issue and explore alternative solutions that address the root causes of traffic congestion, rather than simply penalizing drivers for circumstances beyond their control.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";Title: The Value of Part-Time Jobs: A Glimpse into Adult LifeAs students, we often hear our parents cautioning us about the rigors of adult life, warning us that it's far more demanding than our school days. However, it's challenging to truly comprehend the magnitude of this reality without experiencing it firsthand. That's where part-time jobs come in – offering students a unique opportunity to dip their toes into the world of adulthood.During holidays, many students spend their days idly playing computer games or indulging in leisure activities. While these pursuits can be enjoyable, they don't provide much insight into the realities of adult life. In contrast, part-time jobs offer a chance to experience the daily grind, interact with people from diverse backgrounds, and develop essential life skills.By taking up part-time jobs, students can gain a deeper understanding of the responsibilities and pressures that come with adulthood. They'll learn to manage their time effectively, prioritize tasks, and cope with stress – all invaluable skills that will serve them well in their future careers. Moreover, part-time jobs allow students to earn their own money, teaching them the value of hard-earned cash and the importance of budgeting.Through part-time jobs, students can also develop a stronger sense of self-reliance and independence. They'll learn to navigate real-world situations, solve problems, and think critically – all essential skills for success in adulthood. By experiencing the challenges and rewards of part-time work, students can gain a more realistic understanding of what it means to be an adult.In conclusion, part-time jobs offer students a valuable chance to experience the realities of adult life. By embracing this opportunity, students can develop essential life skills, gain independence, and acquire a deeper understanding of the responsibilities that come with adulthood. So, the next time holidays come around, consider trading in your controller for a timecard – your future self will thank you.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";The age-old debate surrounding the most effective method of studying has sparked intense discussion among scholars. While some swear by the benefits of group work, others, like myself, firmly believe in the superiority of individual study. As I delve into the factors that influence academic success, I am reminded that the pattern of work one chooses is a crucial determinant. In this essay, I will articulate the reasons why I prefer individual work over team-based study.To begin with, my temperament plays a significant role in my preference for individual work. As an introverted person, I tend to thrive in quiet, low-distraction environments where I can focus on the task at hand. Group work, on the other hand, often involves a cacophony of ideas, opinions, and social interactions that can be overwhelming and stifling to my productivity. In contrast, individual study allows me to work at my own pace, absorb information without interruptions, and concentrate on the nuances of the subject matter.Another reason I favor individual work is the ability to take ownership of my learning. When working in a group, there is often a diffusion of responsibility, where individuals may rely on their peers to carry the workload. In contrast, individual study encourages me to be self-sufficient, accountable, and motivated, as I am solely responsible for my progress and understanding of the material.Furthermore, individual work enables me to tailor my study approach to my unique learning style. I can experiment with different techniques, such as the Pomodoro method or mind mapping, to find what works best for me. This flexibility is often compromised in group settings, where the needs and preferences of others may need to be accommodated.In conclusion, while team-based study has its advantages, my preference for individual work is rooted in my temperament, the need for personal accountability, and the flexibility to tailor my study approach to my unique needs. By embracing individual study, I am able to optimize my learning experience and achieve greater academic success.
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;Title: The Value of Personal Employment: Why I Prefer to Have My Own JobIn today's fast-paced world, having a job is a fundamental aspect of life. While some people may prefer to work for others, I firmly believe that having one's own job is the most desirable option. Despite the numerous challenges that come with entrepreneurship, I would prefer to be my own boss. There are several reasons that justify my preference, and I will highlight two of the most significant advantages in this essay.First and foremost, time is the most valuable resource I possess in life. Having my own job allows me to manage my time effectively, which is essential for achieving a balance between work and personal life. When you work for someone else, you are bound by a strict schedule and have limited control over your time. In contrast, being your own boss gives you the freedom to allocate your time as you see fit, enabling you to pursue other passions and interests. This flexibility is crucial in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, which is essential for overall well-being.Secondly, earning money is a fundamental reason why people work. While some may argue that job security and benefits are important factors, the amount of money one earns is often the most important criterion when choosing a job. Having my own job allows me to determine my earning potential, which is directly linked to my hard work and dedication. When you work for someone else, your salary is predetermined, and your earning potential is limited by the company's budget and policies. In contrast, entrepreneurs have the potential to earn unlimited income, which is a significant motivator for many people.In conclusion, having one's own job offers numerous advantages, including the ability to manage one's time effectively and determine one's earning potential. Despite the challenges that come with entrepreneurship, I firmly believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, I would prefer to have my own job, where I can be my own boss and reap the rewards of my hard work and dedication.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";Historic buildings are often considered the backbone of a nation's cultural heritage, offering a tangible link to the past and providing a unique area of study for valuable lessons. These structures have stood the test of time, silently witnessing the evolution of human civilization over thousands of years.One of the most significant reasons why historic buildings are important is that they provide a glimpse into the lives of people who lived in the distant past. They showcase the architectural styles, traditions, and values of bygone eras, allowing us to learn about the social, economic, and political contexts of the time. For instance, the ancient temples of Egypt, the ruins of Greece, and the medieval castles of Europe all tell the story of their respective cultures and the people who built them.Moreover, historic buildings play a crucial role in developing tourism industries. The sheer grandeur and historical significance of these structures attract tourists from all over the world, generating revenue and creating jobs for local communities. In fact, many cities and towns have built their tourism industries around their historic landmarks, using them as a major draw for visitors. For example, the Colosseum in Rome, the Great Wall of China, and the Taj Mahal in India are all major tourist attractions that not only showcase the rich history of their respective countries but also contribute significantly to their economies.In addition to their economic benefits, historic buildings also serve as educational resources. They offer a hands-on learning experience, allowing students to explore and understand the past in a more engaging and interactive way. By studying historic buildings, we can gain insights into the achievements and struggles of our ancestors, and appreciate the sacrifices they made to build the world we live in today.In conclusion, historic buildings are indeed important treasures that offer a window into the past. They provide valuable lessons about the lifestyle of people who lived thousands of years ago, attract tourists, and contribute to the development of tourism industries. As such, it is essential that we preserve and protect these structures for future generations to appreciate and learn from.
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;The Role of Parents as Teachers: An Unparalleled InfluenceIt is a widely held belief that no one else can surpass the teaching abilities of our parents. From the moment we are born, they take on the role of our primary educators, guiding us through every stage of our development. The early years of our lives are marked by their patient instruction, as they teach us the most basic yet essential skills, such as how to smile, walk, and eat. These fundamental lessons lay the groundwork for our future growth and independence.As we grow and mature, our parents continue to impart valuable ethic lessons that have a lasting impact on our lives. They instill in us a sense of morality, responsibility, and compassion, shaping our character and worldview. The teachings of our parents extend far beyond the confines of the classroom, addressing aspects of life that are often overlooked in formal education. Their guidance helps us navigate the complexities of relationships, decision-making, and problem-solving, ultimately preparing us for the challenges of adulthood.In my opinion, the significance of parental teaching is underscored by the sheer amount of time we spend with our families. A substantial portion of our lives is spent at home, surrounded by our loved ones, where we learn through observation, imitation, and direct instruction. In contrast, the time we spend in school, although crucial for academic development, is relatively limited. This disparity highlights the profound influence our parents have on our upbringing and development, making them, in many ways, our most important teachers.
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;The Ability to Adapt: A Vital Component of Job SuccessIn today's fast-paced and ever-changing work environment, the ability to adapt oneself to new situations has become an essential skill for job success. As employees navigate the complexities of their roles, they must be able to adjust to new challenges, technologies, and team dynamics. While working independently is a valuable asset, effective communication is a longer-term skill that benefits both the individual and the organization.Research has shown that employees who possess excellent knowledge of their job are more likely to excel in their roles, leading to increased productivity, job satisfaction, and employee retention. Moreover, when workers have a deep understanding of their job responsibilities, they are better equipped to handle unexpected obstacles, make informed decisions, and provide high-quality results. This expertise not only benefits the individual but also the company as a whole.The benefits of excellent job knowledge are long-term and far-reaching. When employees possess a thorough understanding of their roles, they are able to contribute to the organization in meaningful ways, driving innovation, and improving processes. This, in turn, leads to increased efficiency, cost savings, and a competitive edge in the market. Furthermore, employees with excellent job knowledge are often sought after for leadership roles, mentorship, and knowledge sharing, which helps to spread expertise throughout the organization.In contrast, while working independently is an important skill, it is often a shorter-term benefit. Employees who can work effectively on their own may be able to complete tasks efficiently, but they may not be able to adapt to changing circumstances or contribute to the organization's long-term goals.In conclusion, the ability to adapt to a new environment, combined with excellent knowledge of one's job, is a powerful combination for job success. As employees continue to develop their skills and knowledge, they become invaluable assets to their organizations, driving growth, innovation, and success.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;The advent of computers has revolutionized the fabric of our society, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with one another. Undoubtedly, computers have an indispensable and inevitable role in various sectors, including economics, business, and other areas of societal life. The integration of computers in numerous industries has significantly altered the landscape of employment, reducing the need for human labor in many areas.On one hand, the advantages of computerization are numerous. Computers have increased efficiency, accuracy, and speed in various tasks, leading to improved productivity and competitiveness in the global market. They have enabled the automation of repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing human resources for more complex and creative endeavors. Additionally, computers have facilitated the growth of e-commerce, online banking, and other digital services, making life easier and more convenient for people around the world.On the other hand, the widespread adoption of computers has also led to the displacement of human workers in many industries. With the ability to perform tasks faster and more accurately, computers have replaced humans in jobs such as data entry, bookkeeping, and manufacturing. This has resulted in job losses and unemployment for many individuals, particularly those in low-skilled and low-wage positions. Furthermore, the increasing reliance on computers has also raised concerns about the dehumanization of work, as machines and algorithms begin to supplant human judgment and empathy.In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly transformed our world for the better, their impact on employment has been a mixed bag. As we move forward in this digital age, it is essential that we acknowledge the challenges posed by computerization and work towards creating a future where technology complements human capabilities, rather than replacing them. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of computerization are shared by all, and that the disadvantages are mitigated.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;Learning a foreign language is an essential aspect of a child's educational journey, and it offers a multitude of benefits that extend far beyond the realm of language proficiency. By acquiring a new language, children can significantly strengthen their ability to learn, improve their cognitive skills, and broaden their perspectives on the world.One of the primary advantages of learning a foreign language is its impact on cognitive development. Research has shown that bilingual children tend to perform better in school and have improved memory, problem-solving, and multitasking skills. This is because learning a new language requires the brain to adapt and reorganize its wiring, leading to enhanced cognitive flexibility and improved overall mental agility.Moreover, learning a foreign language can greatly enrich a child's understanding of different cultures and societies. As they delve into the nuances of a new language, they are also exposed to the customs, traditions, and history of the countries where that language is spoken. This can help to foster a deeper appreciation and respect for diverse cultures, as well as a broader perspective on the world and its many complexities.Furthermore, in today's increasingly globalized world, speaking multiple languages can be a valuable asset for children as they grow and enter the workforce. In a world where international communication and collaboration are becoming increasingly important, being able to communicate effectively in multiple languages can open doors to new opportunities, both personally and professionally.In conclusion, learning a foreign language is a vital aspect of a child's education, offering a wide range of benefits that extend far beyond language proficiency. By improving their cognitive abilities, broadening their cultural understanding, and opening doors to new opportunities, learning a foreign language can be a truly transformative experience for children.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;The debate about whether boys and girls should study together has been a contentious issue for many years. While some experts believe that co-education has several disadvantages, I strongly advocate for the benefits of boys and girls studying together. One of the primary advantages of co-education is that it provides an opportunity for boys and girls to interact with each other, learn about each other's behavior, and develop essential social skills.When boys and girls study together, they have a chance to know each other better, which helps to break down gender stereotypes and misconceptions. Boys learn how to communicate effectively with girls, and vice versa, in various situations. This interaction helps to foster mutual respect, understanding, and empathy. By studying together, boys and girls can develop essential life skills, such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, which are crucial for success in their personal and professional lives.Moreover, co-education prepares boys and girls for the real world, where they will inevitably interact with people of the opposite sex. By learning how to behave and communicate with each other in a school setting, they are better equipped to navigate the complexities of relationships and interactions in their future careers and personal lives. On the other hand, some experts argue that attending the same school can cause many disadvantages for boys and girls, such as distractions, decreased academic performance, and increased peer pressure.However, I believe that these disadvantages can be mitigated by implementing effective teaching methods, school policies, and guidance counseling. With proper support and guidance, boys and girls can learn to interact with each other in a healthy and respectful manner, leading to a more harmonious and productive learning environment. In conclusion, I firmly believe that boys and girls should study together.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";"The quote ""The biggest risk is not taking any risk"" by Aristotle highlights the importance of stepping out of one's comfort zone and taking bold steps towards achieving one's goals. Many people are hesitant to take risks due to the fear of failure, but it is precisely this fear that can hold them back from realizing their dreams.Walt Disney, the renowned founder of the Disney Empire, is a shining example of the power of perseverance and risk-taking. Disney's career was marked by numerous challenges and setbacks, but he never let these obstacles deter him from pursuing his passion. He was fired from his first job at a newspaper for ""lacking creativity,"" and his first business, Laugh-O-Gram Studio, went bankrupt. However, Disney did not give up. He continued to work tirelessly, and his risk-taking eventually paid off when he created the iconic character Mickey Mouse and went on to build the Disney Empire.Disney's story illustrates the importance of taking risks and never giving up on one's dreams. His success was not solely due to his talent, but also his willingness to take bold risks and face failure head-on. If Disney had let his fears and setbacks hold him back, the world may never have experienced the magic of Disney.In conclusion, Aristotle's quote emphasizes the importance of embracing risk and perseverance in achieving success. Walt Disney's story serves as a testament to the power of taking bold risks and never giving up on one's dreams. By stepping out of our comfort zones and facing our fears, we can unlock our full potential and achieve greatness. As Disney's story shows, failure is not the end, but rather a stepping stone towards realizing our dreams."
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";Engaging in activities that we don't necessarily enjoy is a fundamental aspect of life. It is essential to recognize that not every task can be pleasurable, and sometimes, we must push through our discomfort to achieve our goals.In our professional lives, we are often faced with tasks that are necessary components of our jobs. These tasks may not be enjoyable, but they are crucial to our success. For instance, attending conferences, meetings, or collaborating with colleagues who may not be our favorite people to work with are all examples of tasks that we may not enjoy. However, they are essential to our growth, learning, and career advancement. By pushing through our discomfort and completing these tasks, we can develop valuable skills, build relationships, and establish ourselves as dedicated and reliable professionals.Interestingly, doing something that we don't initially enjoy can sometimes lead to unexpected enjoyment. When we challenge ourselves to engage in an activity that we think we won't like, we may discover hidden passions or talents. For example, a person who thinks they hate public speaking may find that after delivering a few presentations, they begin to enjoy the rush of adrenaline and the sense of accomplishment that comes with sharing their ideas with others. Similarly, someone who dislikes team sports may discover that they enjoy the camaraderie and sense of belonging that comes with being part of a team.In conclusion, while it's natural to want to avoid activities that we don't enjoy, it's essential to recognize that sometimes, it's necessary to push through our discomfort to achieve our goals. By doing so, we can develop valuable skills, build relationships, and even discover new passions and talents.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;The age-old debate surrounding the ideal time for young adults to leave their parents' nest has long been a contentious issue. While some argue that independence should be attained at a relatively young age, others contend that staying with family for a longer period is more beneficial. As a young adult myself, I firmly believe that living with parents for an extended period is the most advantageous choice.On one hand, the desire for freedom and autonomy is a natural aspect of growing up. Many young adults yearn to spread their wings and experience life on their own terms, free from the perceived constraints of living with family. However, I strongly believe that this eagerness to leave the nest often stems from a lack of preparedness for the realities of independent living. The transition from a sheltered life under parental guidance to a self-sufficient one can be overwhelming, leading to unnecessary stress and financial struggles.On the other hand, living with parents for a longer period allows young adults to gradually develop essential life skills, such as financial management, cooking, and time management, under the watchful eyes of their guardians. This enables them to navigate the challenges of adulthood with greater confidence and competence. Moreover, staying with family also provides an opportunity to build stronger relationships with parents, fostering a deeper understanding and respect for one another.While the idea of independence may seem appealing, I firmly believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period. Not only does this provide a smoother transition into adulthood, but it also allows for a more stable and secure environment in which to grow and develop. Ultimately, the benefits of extended family living far outweigh the perceived benefits of premature independence, making it the more prudent choice for young adults.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;The past hundred years have witnessed a profound transformation in the way people communicate with one another, primarily driven by the rapid advancement of technology. In my opinion, this development has been overwhelmingly positive, despite some drawbacks.To begin with, technology has made it easier than ever to stay in touch with loved ones in faraway places. Gone are the days of relying on traditional postal services, which often took days or even weeks to deliver letters. With the advent of email, social media, and messaging apps, people can now communicate with each other in real-time, regardless of geographical distance. This has been particularly beneficial for those with family and friends living abroad, allowing them to maintain strong relationships despite physical distance.Furthermore, technology has also enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests and passions. Online communities and forums have sprouted up around various hobbies and topics, providing a platform for like-minded individuals to share ideas, knowledge, and experiences. This has not only expanded people's social circles but also fostered a sense of belonging and identity.Another significant advantage of technology is its ability to facilitate remote communication for professional purposes. Video conferencing tools and instant messaging apps have made it possible for colleagues to collaborate and conduct business meetings from anywhere in the world. This has opened up new opportunities for remote work and has greatly increased productivity.Of course, there are some drawbacks to this development. The over-reliance on technology has led to concerns about social isolation, decreased face-to-face interaction, and the spread of misinformation. However, in my opinion, these concerns are far outweighed by the numerous benefits that technology has brought to the way we communicate.In conclusion, the impact of technology on communication has been a profoundly positive one, allowing people to connect with each other in ways that were previously unimaginable. While there are some potential downsides, I firmly believe that the advantages of this development make it an overall net gain for society.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The advent of machines has undoubtedly brought numerous benefits to society. One of the primary advantages of machines is their unparalleled effectiveness compared to humans. Unlike humans, machines do not require rest, which means they can work tirelessly around the clock as long as their employers desire. This unique ability enables machines to consistently produce high-quality products without any mistakes.In contrast, humans are prone to fatigue, which can lead to decreased productivity and accuracy. As humans work for extended periods, their concentration and attention to detail may wane, resulting in subpar performance. Machines, on the other hand, maintain their optimal functioning level at all times, ensuring that every product that rolls off the assembly line meets the highest standards.Moreover, machines can perform tasks with precision and speed that would be impossible for humans to match. For instance, in manufacturing, machines can assemble complex components with ease, whereas humans would struggle to keep up with the demanding pace. This increased efficiency translates to faster production times, lower costs, and ultimately, lower prices for consumers.Another significant benefit of machines is their ability to work in hazardous environments that would be dangerous for humans. For example, in mining and construction, machines can operate in extreme conditions, such as high temperatures or toxic atmospheres, without risking human lives. By taking on these tasks, machines have significantly improved workplace safety and reduced the number of accidents.In conclusion, the benefits of machines to society are multifaceted and far-reaching. Their ability to work tirelessly, produce high-quality products, and perform tasks with precision and speed make them invaluable assets in various industries. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that machines will become even more integrated into our daily lives, leading to further improvements in efficiency, productivity, and safety.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;The rapid advancements in Information Technology (IT) have transformed the way we live, work, and interact with one another. Every day, scientists discover and develop magnificent devices that revolutionize the field of IT. Interactive boards, multicore computers, laptops, and tablets with incredible resolution are just a few examples of the innovative technologies that have made our lives easier and more efficient.Interactive boards, for instance, have transformed the way we learn and teach. With the ability to write, draw, and project images, these boards have made classrooms more engaging and interactive. Multicore computers, on the other hand, have increased processing power, enabling us to perform multiple tasks simultaneously with greater speed and accuracy. Laptops and tablets, with their high-resolution displays, have made it possible to work, play, and communicate on the go.However, despite the numerous benefits of IT, there are also some negative aspects that cannot be ignored. One of the major concerns is the impact of IT on our social skills and relationships. The increased reliance on technology has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, resulting in social isolation and decreased empathy. Cyberbullying, online harassment, and the spread of misinformation are also serious issues that need to be addressed.Furthermore, the rapid obsolescence of IT devices has contributed to electronic waste, posing a significant threat to the environment. The constant need for upgrades and new devices has led to a culture of disposability, where devices are discarded without consideration for their environmental impact.In conclusion, while the advancements in IT have brought about numerous benefits and improvements to our lives, it is essential to acknowledge and address the negative aspects of these technologies. By being aware of the potential drawbacks, we can work towards creating a more balanced and sustainable relationship with IT, ensuring that its benefits are enjoyed by all, while minimizing its negative impacts on society and the environment.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;The world of celebrities has always been a subject of fascination for many. The constant media attention on famous personalities has led to a growing concern among the public, particularly parents, about the impact of this phenomenon on children. On one hand, fame can be a double-edged sword for public figures, as their every move is scrutinized by their admirers. This brings a great deal of responsibility on their shoulders, as their actions can have a profound influence on their fans, especially the young and impressionable ones.On the other hand, excessive media coverage of celebrities seems to have a negative influence on the career choices of children. Many youngsters are inspired by the glitz and glamour of the celebrity world and aspire to become famous themselves. This can lead to a lack of interest in more conventional and stable professions, such as medicine, engineering, or teaching. Instead, they may pursue careers in the entertainment industry, which are often highly competitive and uncertain. This trend can have far-reaching consequences, as it may lead to a shortage of skilled professionals in essential fields.Moreover, the constant exposure to celebrity culture can also lead to unrealistic expectations and a distorted view of reality. Children may become disillusioned with the more mundane aspects of life and instead, crave the fame, wealth, and luxury that they see portrayed in the media. This can result in a lack of appreciation for the value of hard work, dedication, and perseverance, which are essential qualities for success in any field.In conclusion, while fame can bring many benefits, it is crucial that public figures recognize the responsibility that comes with their celebrity status. Parents, educators, and the media must also work together to promote a balanced view of the world, highlighting the importance of diverse career choices and the value of hard work and dedication. Only then can we ensure that the next generation is well-rounded, realistic, and equipped to make a positive impact on society.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";The proliferation of mobile phones has revolutionized the way people of all ages communicate, access information, and seek entertainment. However, despite the numerous benefits that mobile phones have brought to our lives, I strongly concur with the notion that this invention has given rise to a multitude of social problems.First and foremost, the excessive reliance on mobile phones has led to a decline in people's interest in daily activities. With the constant stream of notifications, updates, and endless scrolling, individuals are spending an inordinate amount of time glued to their screens, sacrificing face-to-face interactions and hands-on experiences. This trend is particularly concerning among the younger generation, who are missing out on valuable opportunities for socialization, learning, and personal growth. As people become increasingly enamored with their phones, they risk becoming disengaged from the world around them, leading to a sense of isolation and disconnection.Furthermore, the prolonged use of mobile phones has been linked to a host of physical and visual problems, particularly among children. Staring at screens for extended periods can lead to eye strain, headaches, and decreased eyesight, while the sedentary nature of phone use contributes to poor posture, back pain, and a range of other musculoskeletal issues. These health concerns are compounded by the fact that children are spending more time indoors, glued to their screens, rather than engaging in outdoor activities that promote physical and mental well-being. As a result, it is imperative that parents, educators, and policymakers take steps to mitigate these risks, promoting responsible phone use and encouraging a balance between technology and traditional activities.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;The advent of modern forms of communication has revolutionized the way people interact with each other. The advent of the internet, email, and instant messaging has made it possible for people to connect with others across the globe without any limitations of time and space. These technological advancements have undoubtedly changed the way we communicate for the better.On the one hand, modern forms of communication have numerous benefits. Email and messaging apps have made it possible for people to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away. These platforms have also enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests and passions, thereby expanding their social circle. Moreover, the ease and speed of communication have enabled people to stay updated about current events, news, and trends. For instance, social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have become essential tools for staying informed about local and global news.On the other hand, the increasing reliance on modern forms of communication has had some negative impacts on social lives. One of the most significant demerits is the decline in face-to-face communication. People are spending more time interacting with their screens than with real-life individuals. This has led to a decline in deep, meaningful relationships and an increase in feelings of loneliness and isolation. Furthermore, the constant need to be connected and responsive has led to a culture of instant gratification, where people expect immediate responses and attention. This has resulted in a decline in attention span and an increase in stress levels.In conclusion, modern forms of communication have undoubtedly changed the way we interact with each other for the better. However, it is essential to acknowledge the negative impacts of these technologies on our social lives. To strike a balance, it is crucial to use these technologies judiciously and make an effort to maintain face-to-face communication and nurture meaningful relationships.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";**The Duality of Childhood: Balancing Competition and Cooperation**As children grow and develop, they begin to exhibit distinct personality traits that shape their approach to challenges and interactions. Two such fundamental characteristics are competitiveness and cooperativeness. While these traits may seem mutually exclusive, research suggests that they serve distinct purposes, and children who exhibit both qualities can reap benefits in different aspects of life.**Competitive Children: Independent Problem-Solvers**Children who exhibit competitive tendencies are often more confident in their abilities and more likely to take risks. This confidence enables them to handle situations independently, relying on their own judgment and resourcefulness. When faced with a challenge, they are more inclined to persevere and push themselves to achieve their goals. As a result, competitive children tend to develop strong problem-solving skills, which serve them well in individual pursuits such as academics, sports, or entrepreneurship. Their independent nature also allows them to navigate uncertain situations, think critically, and make decisions without relying on others.**Cooperative Children: Innovative Team Players**On the other hand, cooperative children are adept at working collaboratively with others, fostering an environment of mutual support and respect. This ability to collaborate enables them to structure and implement innovative ideas, leveraging the diverse perspectives and skills of their teammates. Cooperative children are more likely to excel in group projects, community service, or creative endeavors that require collective brainstorming and problem-solving. By working together, they can pool their knowledge, share ideas, and build on each other's strengths to create something greater than the sum of its parts.**Conclusion**In conclusion, both competitive and cooperative traits hold significant value in childhood development. While competitive children develop the confidence and independence to tackle challenges on their own, cooperative children learn to harness the power of teamwork, creativity, and collective innovation. By recognizing and nurturing these diverse strengths, parents, educators, and caregivers can help children cultivate a balanced approach to life, enabling them to excel in various contexts and become well-rounded, effective individuals. Ultimately, embracing both competition and cooperation can equip children with the skills, confidence, and creativity needed to succeed in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;The rapid development of technology has brought about a multitude of both positive and negative impacts on various aspects of our lives. While some argue that technology has detrimental effects, I firmly believe that it has a profoundly positive influence on relationships between people.On the one hand, it is undeniable that technology has some negative consequences. For instance, excessive social media usage can lead to social isolation, decreased attention span, and a decline in face-to-face communication skills. Additionally, the constant stream of information can be overwhelming, causing stress and anxiety. However, when it comes to interpersonal relationships, I strongly believe that technology has a net positive effect.Technology has made it easier for people to stay connected, regardless of geographical distance. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools have enabled us to maintain relationships with friends and family who may be physically far away. This has been especially beneficial for people who have moved away from their hometowns or have loved ones living abroad. Moreover, technology has also enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests and hobbies, fostering a sense of community and belonging.Furthermore, technology has also facilitated communication and collaboration in both personal and professional settings. Email, instant messaging, and project management tools have made it possible to work together seamlessly, regardless of location. This has not only improved productivity but also strengthened relationships between colleagues and clients.In conclusion, while technology has its drawbacks, its positive effects on relationships between people far outweigh the negative. By facilitating communication, connection, and collaboration, technology has bridged geographical gaps and fostered a sense of community and belonging. As technology continues to evolve, I am excited to see how it will further shape and improve our relationships with others.
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;The significance of traditional skills and lifestyles in modern society cannot be overstated. Despite the rapid pace of technological advancements and urbanization, these time-honored practices continue to play a vital role in healthcare, environmental protection, and cultural inheritance.In the realm of healthcare, traditional practices have proven to be invaluable. For instance, the use of herbal medicine and natural remedies has been shown to be effective in treating various ailments, from common colds to chronic diseases. Furthermore, the emphasis on holistic wellness, mental balance, and spiritual harmony in traditional cultures has contributed to the development of alternative therapies and stress management techniques. By embracing these traditional approaches, modern healthcare can provide more comprehensive and sustainable solutions to the growing healthcare needs of our populations.Environmental protection is another area where traditional skills and lifestyles have much to offer. Indigenous communities, for example, have long lived in harmony with nature, employing sustainable practices such as permaculture, agroforestry, and eco-friendly agriculture. These methods not only preserve biodiversity but also promote climate resilience and mitigate the effects of pollution. By learning from these traditional practices, we can develop more effective strategies for environmental conservation and sustainable development.The preservation of traditional skills and lifestyles also ensures the continuation of cultural heritage and inheritance. By safeguarding ancient customs, languages, and art forms, we can gain a deeper understanding of the cultural context in which they evolved. This, in turn, allows us to appreciate the wisdom and ingenuity of our ancestors and apply their knowledge to address contemporary challenges.In conclusion, traditional skills and lifestyles remain essential components of modern society. By embracing and protecting these practices, we can tap into the collective wisdom of our ancestors, foster a more holistic approach to healthcare, promote environmental sustainability, and preserve the rich cultural tapestry of our global community. As we move forward in this rapidly changing world, it is imperative that we cherish and learn from the timeless traditions that have shaped human history.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;The age-old debate surrounding the values of competitiveness and cooperation in children has sparked intense discussion among parents, educators, and experts. While some argue that fostering a competitive spirit in children is essential for their success, others believe that cooperation is the key to their development. In this essay, we will explore the arguments for both perspectives.On one hand, instilling a sense of competitiveness in children can have numerous benefits. A strong competitive drive can motivate children to learn, practice, and strive to be the best among their peers. This, in turn, can lead to improved academic performance, better time management, and a stronger work ethic. Moreover, a competitive spirit can prepare children for the realities of the adult world, where competition is a natural part of personal and professional life. For instance, in sports, competitions, and other extracurricular activities, children learn to set goals, push themselves to achieve them, and develop resilience in the face of setbacks.On the other hand, cooperation is an equally essential quality for children to develop. In school activities, group projects, and community service, children learn the value of teamwork, communication, and mutual respect. Cooperation teaches children to appreciate different perspectives, empathize with others, and work towards a common goal. Furthermore, cooperation is vital in building strong relationships, resolving conflicts, and creating a sense of belonging. For example, in group projects, children learn to delegate tasks, rely on each other's strengths, and celebrate each other's successes.In conclusion, both competitiveness and cooperation are valuable qualities that children should develop. While a competitive spirit can drive children to achieve their best, cooperation is essential for building strong relationships, achieving common goals, and creating a sense of community. Ultimately, a balanced approach that nurtures both competitiveness and cooperation is necessary for children to become well-rounded, successful, and socially responsible individuals. By acknowledging the merits of both values, parents and educators can provide children with the tools they need to thrive in all aspects of life.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;The Impact of Advertisement on Our Lives: Weighing the Advantages and HarmsThe debate surrounding the impact of advertisement on our lives has sparked intense discussion in recent years. On one hand, some people argue that the advantages of advertisement far outweigh the potential harms it may cause. On the other hand, it is undeniable that the advertising market provides numerous working opportunities for individuals from diverse professions, including producers, writers, models, and cameramen.One of the primary benefits of advertisement is its ability to inform consumers about new products and services, allowing them to make informed purchasing decisions. Advertisement also plays a crucial role in promoting competition among businesses, driving innovation and improvement in product quality. Moreover, the advertising industry provides a platform for creative expression, enabling individuals to showcase their artistic skills and talent.The rise of online advertisement has further amplified the benefits of advertisement. Online advertisement offers several advantages, including lower costs, convenience, and ease of monitoring. With the click of a button, businesses can reach a vast audience, track the effectiveness of their campaigns, and make adjustments in real-time. This has made online advertisement an attractive option for businesses of all sizes, from small startups to multinational corporations.However, it is essential to acknowledge the potential harms of advertisement. Excessive exposure to advertisement can lead to consumerism, materialism, and a distorted perception of reality. Furthermore, some advertisement may promote unhealthy or unsustainable lifestyles, contributing to social and environmental problems.In conclusion, while advertisement may have its drawbacks, the advantages it offers, including the provision of working opportunities and the promotion of competition, cannot be overlooked. As the advertising market continues to evolve, it is crucial to strike a balance between the benefits and harms of advertisement, ensuring that its impact on our lives is positive and sustainable.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";The art world has long been plagued by a glaring disparity in compensation, where modern artists can command exorbitant sums for their creations, while laborers toil for years to earn a fraction of that amount. This stark contrast has sparked heated debates about the role of government in addressing this perceived unfairness.Proponents of government intervention argue that it is the state's responsibility to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities. They contend that the government should implement policies to support laborers and artists alike, providing a safety net and resources to help them achieve financial stability. By doing so, the government can help bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots, promoting a more just and equal society.However, critics of government intervention argue that such measures would stifle creativity and innovation in the art world. They posit that the free market dictates the value of art, and that government interference would only serve to distort this natural process. Moreover, they argue that government support for artists would lead to a proliferation of mediocrity, as the emphasis would shift from creating art for art's sake to creating art for government funding.Furthermore, critics argue that laborers and artists are not mutually exclusive categories, and that many artists are also laborers, struggling to make ends meet. They suggest that rather than relying on government handouts, artists and laborers should focus on developing their skills, networking, and marketing themselves to increase their earning potential.In conclusion, the debate surrounding government responsibility in addressing the pay disparity between modern artists and laborers is complex and multifaceted. While some argue that government intervention is necessary to promote fairness and equality, others contend that such measures would undermine the very fabric of the art world. Ultimately, a balanced approach that supports both artists and laborers, while also promoting innovation and creativity, is necessary to address this pressing issue.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";The Impact of Extended Working Hours on Health and Personal LifeIn today's fast-paced world, it has become increasingly common for people to work extended hours, often sacrificing their personal lives for the sake of their careers. However, research has shown that this trend has severe consequences on both physical and mental health, as well as personal relationships. Prolonged working hours can lead to a decline in overall well-being, making individuals more susceptible to various health problems.One of the primary effects of extended working hours is the depletion of energy levels. When people work for long periods, they often become exhausted, leading to a lack of motivation to engage in physical activities. Regular exercise is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, but the tiredness and laziness caused by prolonged work hours can make it challenging for individuals to prioritize physical fitness. As a result, they may experience weight gain, decreased cardiovascular health, and other related problems.Furthermore, working extended hours can also lead to addiction. When individuals become overly invested in their work, they can develop a workaholic mentality, prioritizing their job above all else. This can lead to an imbalance in their personal and professional life, causing strain on relationships with family and friends. The constant pressure to meet deadlines and the stress associated with prolonged work hours can also contribute to mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression.In conclusion, working extended hours can have severe and long-lasting effects on an individual's health and personal life. It is essential for employers and employees to recognize the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. By promoting flexible working hours, providing resources for stress management, and encouraging physical activity, we can mitigate the adverse effects of prolonged work hours and foster a healthier, more balanced lifestyle.
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;The notion of success is often misconstrued with wealth and material possessions. However, a successful man is not solely defined by his bank account or the digits on his paycheck. Rather, it is the accomplishments and achievements that one attains in life that truly measure success.Money, undoubtedly, plays a significant role in our lives, providing us with the means to sustain ourselves and our loved ones. Nevertheless, the ways of earning it are diverse and varied. One can accumulate wealth through a myriad of means, but it is the value and purpose behind one's work that truly matters.A man who has dedicated his life to a craft or a cause, pouring his heart and soul into it, is far more successful than one who merely accumulates wealth without passion or purpose. The former may not have a hefty bank account, but his sense of fulfillment and accomplishment far surpasses that of the latter.It is through hard work, dedication, and passion that one can truly achieve their goals and aspirations. A man who is driven by a sense of purpose, who strives to make a positive impact, and who perseveres through adversity, is the epitome of success. His accomplishments may not be measured in dollars and cents, but in the positive difference he has made in the lives of others.In conclusion, a successful man is not solely defined by his income or material possessions. Rather, it is the value and purpose behind his work, and the accomplishments he achieves through hard work, dedication, and passion, that truly measure his success. It is time we redefine our notion of success and recognize the true value of a life well-lived, a life of purpose, and a life of meaningful achievement.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;The Impact of Advertising on Consumption HabitsIn today's world, advertising has become an integral part of our daily lives. We are constantly bombarded with advertisements on television, streets, magazines, and social media. It is often argued that these advertisements significantly influence people's consumption choices, leading them to buy things they don't necessarily need. While this argument holds some truth, it is essential to acknowledge that buying habits are highly personal and dependent on individual needs and consumption abilities.On one hand, advertising can indeed shape people's consumption patterns. Advertisers use various tactics to make products appealing, such as eye-catching visuals, catchy slogans, and celebrity endorsements. These tactics can create a desire for a product, even if it's not a necessity. For instance, a person may see an advertisement for a new smartphone and feel pressure to upgrade, even if their current phone is still functional. In this sense, advertising can be seen as a driving force behind consumerism, encouraging people to buy more than they need.On the other hand, it is crucial to recognize that buying habits are complex and multi-faceted. While advertising can influence people's choices, it is not the sole determining factor. Individuals have unique needs, preferences, and financial capabilities that shape their consumption decisions. For example, a person may prioritize buying a new laptop for work purposes over a luxury item advertised on television. In this case, their consumption choice is driven by their needs and priorities, rather than solely by advertising.Moreover, people's consumption abilities, such as their income and financial situation, also play a significant role in determining their buying habits. A person may see an advertisement for a high-end product, but their financial constraints may prevent them from making the purchase. In this sense, advertising may not be as influential as other factors, such as financial reality, in shaping consumption choices.In conclusion, while advertising can undoubtedly influence people's consumption habits, it is essential to acknowledge the complexity of individual needs, preferences, and financial capabilities that shape these habits. Advertising is just one of many factors that contribute to consumption decisions, and its impact should not be overstated. By recognizing the multifaceted nature of buying habits, we can better understand the intricate relationships between advertising, individual needs, and consumption choices.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;In most countries, paying taxes is a mandatory obligation for citizens. This financial contribution enables governments to provide essential public services, infrastructure, and social welfare programs. However, while paying taxes is a vital civic duty, I firmly believe that citizens have other equally important responsibilities to fulfill beyond contributing to the state's coffers.One such responsibility is to support vulnerable members of society. In every community, there exist individuals who are struggling to make ends meet, such as the impoverished, disabled, and marginalized. These individuals often rely on the kindness and generosity of others to survive. As citizens, it is our moral obligation to lend a helping hand, whether through volunteering, donating to charitable causes, or simply offering emotional support.Moreover, citizens have a responsibility to engage in their communities and promote social cohesion. This can be achieved by participating in local initiatives, advocating for social justice, and fostering a sense of belonging among residents. By doing so, citizens can help build stronger, more resilient communities that are better equipped to address social and economic challenges.Another important responsibility is to protect the environment and preserve natural resources for future generations. This can be achieved by adopting sustainable lifestyles, reducing carbon footprints, and supporting eco-friendly policies. By taking ownership of our environmental responsibilities, citizens can contribute to a healthier, more sustainable planet.In conclusion, while paying taxes is a fundamental obligation of citizens, it is by no means the only responsibility we bear. By acknowledging and fulfilling our duties to support vulnerable members of society, engage in our communities, and protect the environment, we can build a more compassionate, equitable, and sustainable world. By recognizing the breadth of our civic responsibilities, we can work towards creating a brighter future for all.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";"The notion that students should solely focus on academic subjects like mathematics and physics because they are essential for securing a job is a widely held belief. However, I strongly disagree with this perspective, arguing that there are far more important aspects of life that require attention and nurturing.While it is undeniable that academic subjects provide a solid foundation for future careers, it is crucial to acknowledge that there is more to life than just employment. The pursuit of knowledge, personal growth, and well-being are equally, if not more, important than securing a job. By prioritizing academic subjects over other areas of study, we risk neglecting the development of essential life skills, creativity, and emotional intelligence.Subjects like music, art, and physical education, often considered ""non-academic,"" play a vital role in shaping individuals into well-rounded, empathetic, and innovative thinkers. Music, for instance, has been shown to enhance cognitive skills, boost memory, and promote cultural understanding. Similarly, art and physical education foster creativity, teamwork, and self-discipline, all of which are valuable assets in both personal and professional life.Furthermore, an overemphasis on academic subjects can lead to burnout, stress, and a narrow perspective on life. Students who are encouraged to explore a broad range of subjects, including those often deemed ""non-academic,"" are more likely to develop a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them. This, in turn, enables them to make more informed decisions about their future, including their career choices.In conclusion, while academic subjects are undoubtedly important, it is essential to recognize that there are many aspects of life that are equally, if not more, significant than securing a job. By providing students with a balanced education that includes a range of subjects, we can help them develop into thoughtful, creative, and well-rounded individuals, equipped to thrive in all areas of life."
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The rapid proliferation of internet-based media has sparked a contentious debate about the future of traditional paper media. While some pundits argue that newspapers and magazines will continue to thrive, I firmly believe that these stalwarts of journalism will eventually become relics of the past.On the one hand, the internet has revolutionized the way we consume information. With just a few clicks, we can access a vast array of news sources, articles, and magazines from around the world. Online news portals and social media platforms have made it possible for us to stay informed about current events in real-time, rendering traditional paper media's delayed reporting obsolete. Moreover, online content is often more dynamic, interactive, and tailored to individual interests, making it a more appealing option for many readers.On the other hand, some argue that traditional paper media still has its advantages. Newspapers and magazines offer a tactile experience, allowing readers to disconnect from screens and engage with physical content. Moreover, many publications have a loyal readership that values the editorial curation and in-depth analysis that traditional media provides. However, I believe that these advantages are not enough to stem the tide of digital migration.As technology continues to advance, online media will only become more sophisticated and user-friendly. Already, many publications are shifting their focus to digital platforms, and it's likely that this trend will only accelerate in the future. Furthermore, the environmental impact of paper media, from deforestation to waste generation, will increasingly become a concern for eco-conscious readers.In conclusion, while traditional paper media still has its loyal adherents, I firmly believe that the writing is on the wall. As internet-based media continues to evolve and improve, it's likely that newspapers and magazines will eventually become a thing of the past. As we move forward in this digital age, it's essential to acknowledge the shift and adapt to the changing media landscape.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;The decision-making process when it comes to choosing a job often revolves around the size of the salary offered. In many societies, this factor is prioritized over others, as financial stability is a fundamental aspect of life. However, it is crucial to recognize that there are other equally vital aspects that significantly impact an individual's happiness and quality of life.One such aspect is having friendly colleagues. The people we work with can greatly affect our job satisfaction and overall well-being. A supportive and harmonious work environment can lead to a sense of belonging, which is essential for our emotional and mental health. On the other hand, a toxic work environment can lead to stress, anxiety, and even depression. Therefore, it is essential to consider the company culture and the people we will be working with when making a decision.Another vital aspect is the work-place condition. The physical and aesthetic environment of our workspace can greatly impact our mood, productivity, and overall job satisfaction. A well-designed and well-maintained workspace can boost our creativity, energy, and motivation, while a cramped, noisy, or poorly lit workspace can lead to distractions, discomfort, and dissatisfaction.Furthermore, the work-life balance and flexibility offered by an employer can also significantly impact our quality of life. A job that offers flexible working hours, remote work options, or generous leave policies can greatly improve our work-life balance, allowing us to pursue our personal interests, spend time with loved ones, and recharge our batteries.In conclusion, while salary is an important consideration when choosing a job, it is not the only factor that should be taken into account. Friendly colleagues, a positive work environment, and favorable work-place conditions can have a profound impact on our happiness and quality of life. By considering these aspects, we can make a more informed decision that prioritizes our overall well-being and job satisfaction.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;**The Positive Impact of Computers on Children**In today's world, computers have become an indispensable part of our daily lives. The influence of computers is evident globally, and children are no exception. While some may argue that computers can have a negative impact on children if used daily, this essay will prove that computers can have a profoundly positive effect on children's lives. By analyzing how computers provide children with access to vast resources available on the internet, it becomes clear that computers can be a valuable tool for children's development.The internet has made it possible for children to access a vast array of educational resources, including online libraries, educational websites, and learning platforms. These resources provide children with a wealth of information on various subjects, enabling them to learn at their own pace and explore topics of interest. Additionally, computers allow children to communicate with peers and teachers, fostering collaboration and feedback. This access to information and communication has the potential to improve children's academic performance, as well as broaden their knowledge and understanding of the world.Furthermore, computers can also enhance children's cognitive skills, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. Interactive educational software and games can engage children in learning, making it a fun and enjoyable experience. Moreover, computers can provide children with opportunities to develop essential life skills, such as typing, coding, and digital literacy, which are crucial in today's technology-driven world.In conclusion, the notion that computers can have a negative impact on children if used daily is misguided. On the contrary, computers can be a powerful tool for children's development, providing them with access to vast resources, opportunities for learning, and essential life skills. By embracing computers and the internet, children can unlock a world of knowledge, creativity, and possibility, setting them up for success in an increasingly digital world.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;The notion that children raised in less well-off families are more quick-witted and better equipped to tackle the problems of adult life has been a topic of debate. Some people argue that growing up in a challenging environment fosters resilience and resourcefulness. However, I strongly disagree with this stance.To begin with, children from poorer families are often more susceptible to developing detrimental habits. The harsh realities of poverty can lead some individuals to turn to crime, theft, and violence as a means of survival. These habits not only harm the individual but also have a negative impact on their community. Furthermore, such behaviors can become deeply ingrained, making it difficult for them to break free from a life of crime and violence.Moreover, children from less affluent backgrounds often lack access to quality education. Without a solid educational foundation, they may struggle to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate the complexities of adult life. In contrast, children from more affluent families typically have greater access to educational resources, extracurricular activities, and mentorship opportunities. These advantages can provide them with a stronger foundation for tackling the challenges of adulthood.In conclusion, while some may argue that growing up in a less well-off family fosters quick-wittedness and resilience, I firmly believe that this is not the case. The negative habits and lack of access to quality education that often accompany poverty can hinder a child's ability to succeed in adult life. It is essential to provide support and resources to families in need, ensuring that all children have an equal opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;In recent years, there has been a significant surge in the number of health problems and ailments affecting modern people. While many attribute this trend to sedentary lifestyles, I firmly believe that other factors are playing an even more substantial role in this phenomenon.One of the primary factors contributing to the rise in health issues is the proliferation of processed and fast food. The increasing availability and convenience of these unhealthy options have led to a shift away from traditional, nutritious diets. The high levels of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats present in these foods can cause a range of problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, the widespread use of pesticides, preservatives, and additives in these foods can also have detrimental effects on our health.Another significant factor is the growing concern of environmental pollution. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soil our food is grown in are all increasingly contaminated with pollutants. This can lead to a range of health issues, from respiratory problems to cancer. Climate change, too, is playing a role in the spread of diseases and heat-related illnesses.Additionally, the fast pace of modern life is taking a toll on our mental health. Stress, anxiety, and depression are all on the rise, and can have serious consequences for our physical well-being. The constant connectedness of modern technology can also contribute to these issues, making it difficult for people to disconnect and relax.While a sedentary lifestyle is undoubtedly a contributing factor to modern health problems, it is essential to recognize that it is not the sole cause. By acknowledging and addressing these other factors, we can work towards creating a healthier environment and promoting a better quality of life for all.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";The debate surrounding when foreign language instruction should begin has sparked intense discussion among educators and parents alike. While some argue that this should be introduced in later years, others believe that it is essential to start as early as pre-school. In my opinion, I firmly believe that introducing a secondary language in kindergarten is not only beneficial but also crucial for a child's cognitive, social, and cultural development.First and foremost, research has shown that children's brains are wired to learn languages quickly and effortlessly during the early years. In fact, studies have demonstrated that children as young as three years old can differentiate between phonetic sounds and begin to develop an understanding of grammar rules. By introducing a secondary language in kindergarten, we can capitalize on this critical period of language acquisition, setting the stage for a lifelong love of language learning.Moreover, learning a secondary language at a young age has been proven to have numerous cognitive benefits. It can improve memory, problem-solving skills, and even enhance academic performance in other subjects. Additionally, being bilingual or multilingual has been shown to delay the onset of age-related cognitive decline and even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.Furthermore, introducing a secondary language in kindergarten can also foster cultural awareness and understanding. In an increasingly globalized world, it is essential that our children are equipped with the tools to communicate and connect with people from diverse backgrounds. By starting early, we can help break down cultural barriers and promote a more harmonious and interconnected world.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate, I firmly believe that introducing a secondary language in kindergarten is essential for a child's cognitive, social, and cultural development. By capitalizing on the critical period of language acquisition, we can set our children up for a lifetime of language learning, cultural awareness, and academic success.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;The last few decades have witnessed a significant boom in international tourism. This phenomenon has sparked intense debate among scholars, policymakers, and the general public. While some argue that the proliferation of international tourism has brought more problems than benefits, others contend that it can be a highly rewarding venture for local economies. This essay will explore both perspectives, examining the challenges and opportunities presented by flourishing tourism.On the one hand, critics argue that the rapid growth of international tourism has led to numerous problems. One of the primary concerns is the environmental degradation caused by the influx of tourists. Over-tourism can result in pollution, erosion of natural habitats, and destruction of local ecosystems. Furthermore, the strain on local infrastructure can lead to issues such as overcrowding, increased crime rates, and strain on public services. Additionally, the cultural homogenization of tourist destinations can result in the loss of traditional practices and the erosion of local identity.On the other hand, proponents of international tourism argue that it can be a highly rewarding venture for local economies. When managed sustainably, tourism can generate significant revenue and create employment opportunities for local communities. The injection of foreign capital can also stimulate economic growth, improve infrastructure, and enhance the quality of life for residents. Moreover, tourism can promote cross-cultural exchange, fostering greater understanding and appreciation between different nations and cultures. In many cases, tourism has been instrumental in preserving cultural heritage sites and promoting conservation efforts.In conclusion, while the proliferation of international tourism has brought its fair share of challenges, it also presents numerous opportunities for local economies. By adopting sustainable tourism practices and implementing effective management strategies, destinations can mitigate the negative impacts and harness the benefits of tourism. Ultimately, flourishing tourism can be a win-win situation for both tourists and local communities, promoting economic growth, cultural exchange, and environmental conservation.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;The Impact of Leisure Activities on Child DevelopmentIn today's society, the way children spend their leisure time has a significant impact on their overall development. Two contrasting activities that have sparked debate are watching television and engaging in creative, cooperative, and competitive activities. While watching TV is a common pastime for many children, research suggests that it is a passive action that should not be promoted. On the other hand, activities that foster creativity, cooperation, and competition have been shown to have a positive impact on child development.Watching TV is a sedentary activity that requires minimal cognitive engagement. Prolonged periods of TV watching have been linked to a range of negative outcomes, including obesity, decreased attention span, and reduced academic performance. Moreover, excessive TV watching can lead to a lack of creativity, imagination, and critical thinking skills. Therefore, increasing periods spent watching TV should not be encouraged.In contrast, activities that promote creativity, cooperation, and competition have been shown to have a profoundly positive impact on child development. Engaging in activities such as arts and crafts, team sports, and puzzles can help children develop essential life skills, including problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. These activities also foster creativity, imagination, and critical thinking, all of which are essential for academic success and future career prospects.Studies have consistently shown that children who participate in creative, cooperative, and competitive activities tend to perform significantly better in general terms. They tend to have higher academic achievement, better social skills, and greater emotional intelligence. Furthermore, these activities can help children develop a sense of purpose, motivation, and self-esteem, all of which are essential for their overall well-being.In conclusion, while watching TV may be a common leisure activity, it is a passive action that should not be promoted. In contrast, activities that promote creativity, cooperation, and competition have been shown to have a profoundly positive impact on child development. Parents, educators, and policymakers should encourage and provide opportunities for children to engage in these activities, which can have a lasting impact on their academic, social, and emotional development.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;The concept of working or studying from home has been a topic of debate in recent years. While some individuals view it as a blessing, others consider it a curse. On one hand, proponents of working from home argue that it provides flexibility, comfort, and increased productivity. Without the distractions and interruptions of a traditional office or classroom setting, individuals can focus better and manage their time more efficiently.On the other hand, many employers and teachers believe that working or studying from home can be detrimental to an individual's performance. One of the primary concerns is the lack of face-to-face interaction and communication. When employees work from home, they may spend a significant amount of time communicating with colleagues via phone or email, which can lead to misunderstandings and delayed responses. This can ultimately harm an employee's deliverables and overall job performance.Similarly, teachers argue that students who study from home may struggle to clear their doubts and confusion in a timely manner. Unlike a traditional classroom setting where students can ask questions and receive immediate feedback, studying from home can lead to prolonged periods of confusion and frustration. This can negatively impact a student's understanding of the material and overall academic performance.Furthermore, the lack of social interaction and accountability can also take a toll on individuals who work or study from home. Without the structure and routine of a traditional office or classroom, individuals may struggle with procrastination, motivation, and time management.In conclusion, while working or studying from home may offer some advantages, it also has its drawbacks. Employers and teachers have valid concerns about the impact of isolation on an individual's performance, and individuals must be aware of these potential pitfalls.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;The rise of international tourism has brought about a plethora of effects, both positive and negative, on the world's cultural landscape. One of the most significant impacts is the tension that arises between people from different cultural backgrounds. When tourists and locals interact, cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and even conflicts. For instance, what may be considered polite in one culture may be deemed rude in another, leading to unintended offense.However, it is in these moments of tension that international tourism can also facilitate understanding and empathy between people from different cultures. When conflicts or debates arise, individuals are often forced to engage with each other, to listen to each other's perspectives, and to try to understand where the other person is coming from. This process of active listening and open-mindedness can lead to a deeper understanding of cultural differences and similarities.Through international tourism, people are given the opportunity to experience different ways of life, to challenge their own cultural assumptions, and to broaden their perspectives. As tourists and locals interact, they begin to realize that, despite their cultural differences, they share common human experiences and values. This realization can foster empathy, tolerance, and mutual respect, ultimately leading to a more harmonious coexistence.Moreover, international tourism can also facilitate people-to-people diplomacy, where individuals from different cultures engage in informal, grassroots interactions that can help to break down cultural stereotypes and build bridges between nations. By sharing meals, stories, and laughter, tourists and locals can create meaningful connections that transcend cultural boundaries.In conclusion, international tourism is a double-edged sword, capable of causing tension and conflict, but also of fostering understanding and empathy between people from different cultures. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is essential to recognize the potential of international tourism to promote cross-cultural understanding and to harness this potential to build a more peaceful and harmonious global community.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;The notion that celebrities are often recognized for their glamorous lifestyle rather than their professional accomplishments is a common perception. Indeed, some celebrities do tend to focus more on projecting an image in the public eye, rather than emphasizing the hard work and dedication that goes into their craft. However, this generalization does not apply to all celebrities. In fact, many celebrities use their platform to inspire and lead young people in a positive direction.On one hand, it is undeniable that some celebrities prioritize their public image over their actual work. They often use social media to showcase their lavish lifestyles, designer clothing, and exotic vacations. This can create a false narrative that success is solely based on one's appearance and material possessions, rather than hard work and talent. For instance, some reality TV stars and social media influencers have built their careers on promoting a luxurious and glamorous lifestyle, without necessarily showcasing any substantial skills or achievements.On the other hand, there are many celebrities who use their fame to promote positive values and inspire young people. For example, actors like Leonardo DiCaprio and Emma Watson are known for their environmental activism and philanthropic efforts. Musicians like Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé use their music to address social justice issues and promote empowerment. These celebrities demonstrate that success is not just about fame and fortune, but also about using one's platform to make a positive impact.In conclusion, while it is true that some celebrities focus more on their image than their work, it is unfair to generalize this to all celebrities. Many celebrities are using their platform to inspire and lead young people in a positive direction, promoting values such as hard work, dedication, and social responsibility.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;The advent of television has revolutionized the way we consume information, and its impact on the younger generation is a topic of considerable debate. While TV can be an immense source of knowledge and a valuable tool for learning, allowing students to watch it excessively, both at school and home, can have far-reaching consequences on their overall growth and development.On the one hand, TV offers a vast array of educational programs that can cater to diverse learning styles and interests. Students can acquire knowledge on various subjects, from science and history to culture and languages. Moreover, TV can help pupils develop essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical reasoning. For instance, documentaries and educational shows can foster curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning. Furthermore, TV can also provide a platform for students to engage with current events, social issues, and cultural diversity, broadening their perspectives and promoting empathy.However, excessive TV watching can have a profoundly negative impact on students' physical, emotional, and cognitive growth. Prolonged screen time can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity, eye strain, and other health problems. Moreover, excessive TV watching can also affect students' social skills, as they spend less time interacting with peers, family, and their community. This can result in social isolation, decreased communication skills, and reduced emotional intelligence. Furthermore, excessive TV watching can also hinder academic performance, as students spend less time engaging in physical activity, reading, and other intellectually stimulating activities.In conclusion, while TV can be a valuable educational tool, allowing students to watch it excessively, both at school and home, can have detrimental effects on their overall growth and development. Therefore, it is essential for parents, educators, and policymakers to strike a balance between TV watching and other aspects of a student's life, ensuring that they reap the benefits of TV while minimizing its negative impacts. By promoting a balanced and responsible approach to TV watching, we can help students harness its educational potential while safeguarding their physical, emotional, and cognitive well-being.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;The Age Paradigm: A Barrier to InnovationThe idea that older workers are inherently more valuable than their younger counterparts is a notion that has been perpetuated for far too long. However, this paradigm is no longer tenable in today's fast-paced, ever-evolving work environment. The truth is, older workers are often mired in outdated thinking, unable to adapt to the rapid changes that are hallmarks of the modern workplace.One of the primary reasons for this stagnation is their preference for monotony and safe ideology. Older workers often become comfortable with established procedures and are hesitant to deviate from them, even when presented with innovative solutions. This resistance to change is a major obstacle to progress and can stifle the creativity and ingenuity that younger workers bring to the table.On the other hand, knowledge is a key factor that enables younger workers to outrank their elderly counterparts. The rapid pace of technological advancements and the proliferation of information have created a knowledge-based economy where those who are able to learn and adapt quickly are best positioned to succeed. Younger workers, having grown up in this environment, are naturally more adept at navigating this landscape and are better equipped to leverage knowledge to drive innovation and growth.In contrast, older workers often rely on their years of experience and accumulated knowledge, but this can be a double-edged sword. While experience is undoubtedly valuable, it can also lead to a fixed mindset and a resistance to new ideas. As a result, younger workers, who are more open to learning and embracing new concepts, are often better positioned to drive innovation and progress.In conclusion, the notion that older workers are inherently more valuable than younger ones is a flawed paradigm that needs to be reexamined. The ability to adapt, learn, and innovate is what truly sets individuals apart in the modern workplace, and it is these qualities that will ultimately determine success, regardless of age.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The use of machines has been a topic of debate in recent years, with some individuals believing that it has a negative impact on human health, while others argue that it has numerous benefits. On one hand, some people think that the increasing reliance on machines is harmful to human health, as it decreases the amount of physical work done by people. This, in turn, can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to various health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, the reduced physical activity can also affect mental health, leading to issues such as depression and anxiety.On the other hand, many people believe that using machines makes work easier and less time-consuming. With the help of machines, people can accomplish tasks that would otherwise require a lot of time and effort. For instance, machines can help with household chores, such as cleaning and laundry, freeing up time for more leisure activities or other pursuits. Additionally, machines can also improve productivity in the workplace, enabling people to complete tasks more efficiently and effectively. This, in turn, can lead to increased job satisfaction and reduced stress levels.Moreover, machines can also improve the overall quality of life for people with disabilities or chronic illnesses. For example, machines such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs can greatly improve mobility and independence for people with physical disabilities. Similarly, machines such as dialysis machines and ventilators can greatly improve the quality of life for people with chronic illnesses.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, it is clear that the use of machines has numerous benefits for human health and productivity. Rather than decreasing physical activity, machines can actually enable people to engage in more leisure activities and pursuits that they enjoy, leading to an overall improvement in physical and mental well-being.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;In recent years, there has been a growing sentiment that conventional practices and traditions are outdated and should be eliminated. However, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint. In my opinion, conventional skills and ways are an integral part of a country's cultural heritage and play a vital role in shaping its identity.First and foremost, traditional skills and practices are a valuable part of a nation's cultural wealth. They have been passed down through generations and are a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of our ancestors. These conventional ways of doing things, such as craftsmanship, art, and music, are what set one culture apart from another and make them unique. They are a source of national pride and a reflection of a country's history and values.Consequently, people feel proud of their country's cultural heritage and take steps to preserve and pass on these conventional practices to future generations. In many countries, traditional skills and ways are still highly valued and are an important part of national identity. For example, in Japan, the traditional tea ceremony is still an important part of the country's cultural heritage, while in India, the ancient art of yoga is still widely practiced.Furthermore, conventional practices and skills are not static, but rather, they evolve and adapt to changing times. Many traditional skills have been incorporated into modern industries, such as fashion, architecture, and technology, and have played a significant role in shaping their development.In conclusion, conventional practices and skills are not something that should be eliminated. Instead, they should be celebrated and preserved as an important part of a country's cultural heritage. They are a source of national pride and play a vital role in shaping a nation's identity. By preserving and promoting these conventional ways, we can ensure that our cultural heritage continues to thrive and evolve for generations to come.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;"The modern metropolis is often characterized as a ""melting pot,"" where individuals from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and socioeconomic statuses converge to create a vibrant, dynamic urban landscape. However, this phenomenon has also led to a plethora of challenges, with traffic overload being one of the most pressing concerns. Overpopulation has resulted in congested streets, decreased air quality, and increased travel times, making the daily commute a frustrating experience for many city dwellers.In response to this issue, city planners have been exploring innovative solutions to mitigate the effects of traffic overload. One such approach is to promote the use of non-personal vehicles, such as public transportation, carpooling, and ride-sharing services. By incentivizing the use of shared transportation, cities can reduce the number of private vehicles on the road, subsequently decreasing congestion and pollution. Additionally, cities can invest in improving public transportation infrastructure, making it more efficient, reliable, and accessible to the masses.Another strategy that city planners can employ is the exploitation of suburban areas. By developing these areas into thriving commercial and residential hubs, cities can decentralize population growth, reducing the strain on central urban areas. This can be achieved through the creation of satellite cities, where residents can live, work, and access amenities without needing to commute to the city center. Furthermore, suburban areas can be designed with green spaces, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and mixed-use developments, promoting a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle.In conclusion, while traffic overload is a significant problem in modern cities, city planners have the opportunity to opt for creative solutions. By promoting non-personal vehicle use and exploiting suburban areas, cities can alleviate congestion, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality of life for their inhabitants. By adopting these strategies, cities can maintain their status as vibrant, melting pots of culture and diversity, while also ensuring a sustainable and livable environment for generations to come."
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;"The influence of media and celebrities on young people has become a pressing concern in today's society. It is widely acknowledged that the younger generation is heavily impacted by the lifestyles and behaviors of their favorite celebrities. However, it is crucial to recognize that emulating these celebrities can have detrimental effects on the health and personality of young individuals.One of the primary concerns is the impact on young people's physical and mental health. Celebrities often promote unrealistic beauty standards, encouraging young fans to engage in unhealthy habits such as excessive dieting, substance abuse, or even plastic surgery. The constant bombardment of airbrushed images and fitness tutorials on social media can lead to body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and eating disorders. Moreover, the pressure to maintain a ""perfect"" appearance can result in mental health issues like anxiety and depression.Furthermore, the influence of celebrities on young people's personality is also a cause for concern. The constant exposure to celebrity culture can lead to a sense of entitlement, narcissism, and a lack of empathy. Young fans may idolize their favorite celebrities, emulating their behavior, including reckless and irresponsible actions. This can result in a distorted view of reality, where young people prioritize fame, wealth, and material possessions over values like kindness, hard work, and integrity.In conclusion, while it is natural for young people to look up to celebrities as role models, it is essential for parents, educators, and the media to promote a balanced and critical perspective on celebrity culture. Young individuals must be encouraged to develop their own values, interests, and identities, rather than blindly following the lead of their favorite celebrities. By doing so, we can help protect the health and personality of our youth, and foster a more positive and well-rounded generation."
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;The issue of gender equality has been a topic of discussion for many years, with the ultimate goal of achieving equal representation of both men and women in the development of human resources. Significant strides have been made in this regard, as many institutions now strive to maintain a balanced ratio of male and female students across various courses.In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of women in many parts of the world. This shift is attributed to the growing recognition of the importance of gender equality and the efforts made by governments, organizations, and individuals to promote equal opportunities for women. As a result, women are now more likely to pursue higher education and careers in fields that were previously dominated by men.The acceptance of equal numbers of male and female students in various courses has been a key factor in promoting gender equality. This has led to a more diverse and inclusive learning environment, where students from both genders can interact and learn from each other. Furthermore, the increasing number of women in the workforce has contributed to a more balanced representation of perspectives and ideas, ultimately leading to more effective decision-making and problem-solving.The rising proportion of women in many parts of the world is a positive trend that indicates progress towards achieving gender equality. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure that women have equal access to opportunities and resources. Continued efforts are necessary to address the remaining disparities and to promote a culture of inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of gender. By doing so, we can work towards a more equitable society where both men and women can contribute equally to the development of human resources.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;Smoking is a habit that has been stigmatized globally due to its numerous negative consequences. Not only does it pose health risks to the smoker, but it also endangers the lives of those around them, commonly referred to as passive smokers. The second-hand smoke emitted from cigarettes can be just as detrimental to one's health as firsthand smoke.Smokers may argue that smoking is a matter of personal choice and that they have the right to indulge in the habit wherever they please. However, this argument is flawed when considering the broader implications of smoking in public places. Bus and railway stations, in particular, are areas where people from all walks of life congregate, making them prime locations for the spread of second-hand smoke. Prohibiting smoking in these public areas can significantly reduce the risks associated with passive smoking. By doing so, governments can protect the health and well-being of their citizens, particularly vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, and those with pre-existing medical conditions.Moreover, banning smoking in public places can also serve as a deterrent to those who may be contemplating taking up the habit. By removing the visibility of smoking in everyday life, the appeal of cigarettes may be diminished, especially among young people. Ultimately, prohibiting smoking in public places such as bus and railway stations is a necessary step towards creating a healthier environment for everyone.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;The impact of tourism on local communities and the environment has long been a topic of debate. While some argue that tourism can contribute to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation, and irreparable damage to exploited places, I firmly believe that combining tourism with educational processes can mitigate these negative effects and foster a harmonious relationship between humans and their surroundings.On the one hand, mass tourism can indeed have devastating consequences, such as overcrowding, pollution, and cultural homogenization. The influx of tourists can disrupt local economies, leading to inflation, gentrification, and the displacement of native populations. Moreover, the environmental toll of tourism can be catastrophic, with the destruction of natural habitats, depletion of resources, and degradation of ecosystems.However, I contend that by incorporating educational components into tourism, we can promote a more sustainable and responsible form of travel. By teaching tourists about local customs, history, and environmental issues, we can raise awareness and encourage empathy towards the host community. This approach can also support local economies in a more equitable manner, as tourists are more likely to engage with local businesses and respect the environment.Moreover, educational tourism can empower local communities to take ownership of their cultural heritage and natural resources. By providing them with the skills and knowledge to manage tourism sustainably, we can help them reap the benefits while minimizing the negative impacts. This harmonious relationship between human and their surroundings can be achieved by promoting eco-tourism, cultural tourism, and community-based tourism, which prioritize the well-being of both the environment and the local population.In conclusion, while tourism can have negative consequences, I firmly believe that combining it with educational processes can mitigate these effects and foster a more sustainable and responsible form of travel. By promoting awareness, empathy, and community engagement, we can work towards a harmonious relationship between humans and their surroundings.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;The advent of Information Technology (IT) over the past two decades has revolutionized various aspects of our lives, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with one another. On one hand, IT has brought about remarkable advancements in our standard of living and work efficiency. The internet, mobile devices, and social media have made it easier to access information, communicate, and stay connected with people worldwide. Automation and artificial intelligence have streamlined processes, increased productivity, and enabled businesses to operate more efficiently.However, it is increasingly believed that the rapid evolution of IT has a darker side. The constant bombardment of notifications, emails, and social media updates has led to a culture of instant gratification, where individuals feel compelled to be constantly connected and responsive. This has resulted in a phenomenon where IT users have become enslaved by the very technology designed to liberate them.The relentless pace of IT development has led to a state of perpetual distraction, where individuals are glued to their screens, sacrificing precious time, attention, and mental well-being. The boundaries between work and personal life have become increasingly blurred, as the expectation to be constantly available and responsive has become the norm. Furthermore, the addiction to social media has led to the erosion of meaningful relationships, as people substitute online interactions for genuine human connections.In conclusion, while IT has undoubtedly improved our lives in many ways, its rapid evolution has also created a culture of dependency and addiction. It is essential for us to recognize the pitfalls of IT and establish a healthier balance between technology use and other aspects of our lives. By doing so, we can harness the benefits of IT while maintaining our autonomy and well-being in the digital age.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;In recent years, there has been a significant surge in the number of individuals adopting a vegetarian lifestyle. This growing trend can be attributed to several factors, with health improvement being the primary motivator. A well-planned vegetarian diet has been consistently shown to provide numerous health benefits, leading many to make the switch.One of the main reasons for the increasing popularity of a vegetarian diet is the plethora of health advantages it offers. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Vegetarians tend to have lower blood pressure, healthier body mass indexes, and improved overall well-being. The health benefits of a vegetarian diet are undeniable, and as people become more health-conscious, they are turning to this lifestyle choice as a means of improving their overall health.Religious beliefs also play a significant role in the adoption of a vegetarian diet. In many Eastern cultures, vegetarianism is deeply rooted in spiritual and philosophical traditions. For example, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism all promote a lacto-vegetarian diet, which excludes meat, fish, and eggs, but allows dairy products. In these cultures, a vegetarian diet is seen as a way of promoting non-violence, compassion, and self-discipline. In the Western world, while religious beliefs may not be the primary motivator, many individuals are drawn to the spiritual and ethical aspects of a vegetarian lifestyle.In conclusion, the rapid increase in the number of vegetarians can be attributed to the numerous health benefits associated with a well-planned vegetarian diet, as well as the influence of religious beliefs. As people become more aware of the advantages of a plant-based diet, it is likely that this trend will continue to grow.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;The rapid advancement of technology has brought about unprecedented changes in various aspects of our lives, transforming the way we live, interact, and work. As technological developments continue to permeate different countries, it is inevitable that modern skills and new lifestyles will emerge, leading to a shift in societal norms. However, from my perspective, I firmly believe that while tradition will undoubtedly undergo a transformation, its complete disappearance from society is unlikely.On one hand, the integration of technology has already begun to alter traditional practices and customs. With the increasing popularity of digital communication, face-to-face interactions are becoming less frequent, potentially threatening the very foundations of traditional community-building. Moreover, the rise of e-commerce and online shopping platforms may lead to a decline in traditional marketplaces and local businesses, which are often deeply rooted in cultural heritage. As a result, there is a risk that traditional skills and knowledge may be lost as younger generations become more adept at navigating the digital world.On the other hand, tradition is an integral part of a society's identity and cultural fabric. Despite the influx of modernity, people will continue to find value in their cultural heritage and the sense of belonging it provides. In fact, technology can also serve as a tool to preserve and promote tradition, allowing it to evolve and adapt to the changing times. For instance, digital platforms can be used to document and share traditional practices, making them more accessible and engaging for a wider audience. Furthermore, the blending of tradition with modernity can lead to the creation of new, innovative cultural expressions that are relevant to contemporary society.In conclusion, while technological advancements will undoubtedly bring about changes in traditional practices, I firmly believe that tradition will not disappear from society. Instead, it will undergo a transformation, incorporating modern elements while retaining its essence. As society continues to evolve, it is crucial that we find ways to balance progress with preservation, ensuring that our cultural heritage remains a vibrant and integral part of our identity.
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;The Role of Zoos in Education and Research: A Vital Resource in a Globalizing WorldIn an era where globalization is rapidly encroaching upon natural habitats, zoos have become a vital resource for education and research. Far from being mere recreational facilities, zoos offer a unique opportunity for learners to engage with real and vivid materials that enhance their understanding of the natural world. At a higher level, zoos provide university students with a valuable platform for biological research, enabling them to collect practical statistics and live recordings that would otherwise be inaccessible.One of the primary benefits of zoos as an educational resource is the ability to provide hands-on learning experiences. By observing animals in a controlled environment, students can gain a deeper understanding of their behavior, physiology, and ecology. This experiential learning is particularly effective for students of biology, zoology, and conservation, who can apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. Moreover, zoos often collaborate with universities to offer internships, research opportunities, and educational programs, further solidifying their role as a hub for academic inquiry.Furthermore, zoos offer a unique research environment for university students. By studying animals in a controlled setting, researchers can collect data and observations that would be difficult or impossible to obtain in the wild. This practical research experience is invaluable for students pursuing careers in biology, ecology, and conservation. Additionally, zoos often participate in conservation efforts, providing students with opportunities to engage in meaningful research that contributes to the preservation of species and ecosystems.In conclusion, zoos play a vital role in education and research, offering learners a unique opportunity to engage with real and vivid materials that enhance their understanding of the natural world. As the process of globalization continues to encroach upon natural habitats, zoos will become increasingly important as a resource for biological research and conservation. By recognizing the value of zoos in education and research, we can harness their potential to inspire future generations of scientists, conservationists, and environmental stewards.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";The debate over the role of government in preserving minority languages has been ongoing, with various arguments presented on both sides. While some may argue that resources should be focused on more widely spoken languages, I firmly believe that the government has a crucial role in preserving minority languages.The formation of a language is a gradual process that has taken thousands of years to develop. It is a testament to the creativity, resilience, and unique cultural heritage of the communities that speak them. Given the immense effort and time that has gone into shaping these languages, it is essential that we respect and preserve them for future generations.Language is a vital component of a community's identity and culture. It is the thread that weaves together the customs, traditions, and values of a people, making them distinct from others. The loss of a minority language would not only mean the erosion of a community's heritage but also the loss of the unique cultural perspectives and ways of life that they bring to the world.In a world where globalization and homogenization are increasingly prevalent, preserving minority languages is crucial in maintaining the rich tapestry of human diversity. By supporting these languages, governments can help to promote cultural understanding, tolerance, and exchange. Furthermore, preserving minority languages can also have practical benefits, such as promoting tourism, education, and economic development in the regions where they are spoken.In conclusion, despite the challenges and arguments against it, I strongly believe that the government should prioritize the preservation of minority languages. These languages are a precious part of our collective cultural heritage, and their loss would be a tragedy for humanity. By working to preserve them, we can help to ensure that the world remains a vibrant and diverse place, where different cultures and languages can thrive.
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";"The age-old adage ""prevention is better than cure"" holds significant weight in the realm of medicine. This saying emphasizes the importance of taking proactive measures to prevent illnesses rather than treating them after they have occurred. Not only does prevention alleviate the suffering and discomfort associated with diseases, but it also yields substantial economic benefits.By pre-empting certain kinds of diseases, individuals and societies can avoid the financial burdens that come with medical treatment, hospitalization, and lost productivity. Chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer, are often preventable through lifestyle modifications and healthy habits. By adopting preventive measures, individuals can reduce their risk of developing these conditions, thereby minimizing the economic strain on healthcare systems and personal finances.One crucial aspect of prevention is education, particularly among children. Teaching children about balanced diets, nutritious food, and harmful food is essential in shaping their eating habits and promoting healthy lifestyles. By introducing this knowledge at a young age, children are more likely to develop good habits that will benefit them throughout their lives. Schools and parents should emphasize the importance of consuming a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, while limiting sugary drinks, fast food, and processed snacks.Moreover, children should be encouraged to engage in regular physical activity, such as sports, dance, or simply playing outdoors. This not only helps them develop healthy habits but also enhances their cognitive function, concentration, and overall well-being. By empowering children with this knowledge, we can ensure that future generations prioritize prevention over cure, leading to a healthier and more economically sustainable society.In conclusion, the saying ""prevention is better than cure"" holds significant truth in the medical field. By pre-empting certain diseases and promoting healthy habits, individuals and societies can reap economic benefits and improve overall well-being. Educating children about balanced diets and healthy lifestyles is a critical step in shaping a healthier future."
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;"The notion that outstanding academic students are the only ones eligible for university admission has sparked intense debate. While some argue that academic prowess is the sole determinant of university readiness, others contend that this narrow focus overlooks the diverse range of talents and skills that university education can foster. In this essay, we will explore the argument that university is not just about academic studies, but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills, and examine the pros and cons of restricting university admission to only outstanding academic students.On one hand, it is undeniable that academic achievement is a crucial indicator of a student's ability to succeed in a university setting. Outstanding academic students have demonstrated a strong foundation in their chosen field of study and are well-equipped to handle the rigors of university-level coursework. By prioritizing academic achievement, universities can ensure that their students are well-prepared to excel in their chosen field. However, this approach overlooks the many students who may not excel academically, but possess exceptional artistic or soft skills that could be nurtured and developed in a university setting.University is not just about academic studies; it is also a place where students can explore their creativity, develop their critical thinking skills, and cultivate their emotional intelligence. By restricting admission to only outstanding academic students, universities may be missing out on talented individuals who could bring unique perspectives and skills to the academic community. Moreover, the emphasis on academic achievement can lead to a narrow focus on grades and test scores, rather than on the development of the whole person.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, it is clear that university restriction has both pros and cons. While prioritizing academic achievement can ensure that students are well-prepared for university-level coursework, it also overlooks the diverse range of talents and skills that university education can foster. Ultimately, universities should strive to create a holistic admissions process that takes into account not only academic achievement, but also artistic talent and soft skills. By doing so, universities can foster a diverse and inclusive community that values the development of the whole person, rather than just academic achievement."
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;The age-old debate about who has a greater impact on a child's upbringing - parents or teachers - has been a topic of discussion for years. While both parents and teachers play a vital role in shaping a child's personality and education, I firmly believe that teachers have a more significant influence on a child's educational development in some aspects.First and foremost, teachers are trained professionals who have a deep understanding of the curriculum and learning processes. They are equipped with the skills and knowledge to impart education in a structured and systematic manner, which is essential for a child's cognitive development. In contrast, parents, although well-intentioned, may not have the same level of expertise or experience in teaching. Moreover, teachers are responsible for creating a conducive learning environment that fosters academic growth, discipline, and socialization.Another significant advantage of teachers is that they are able to provide individualized attention to each child, which is often not possible for parents who have to manage multiple responsibilities at home. Teachers can identify a child's strengths and weaknesses, and tailor their teaching methods accordingly. This personalized approach helps children to overcome their learning difficulties and reach their full potential.Furthermore, teachers play a crucial role in shaping a child's worldview and values. They expose children to diverse perspectives, ideas, and cultures, which broadens their horizons and helps them become more empathetic and open-minded individuals. Teachers also model behavior and social norms, which children learn through observation and imitation.In conclusion, while parents are undoubtedly essential in a child's upbringing, I firmly believe that teachers have a more significant impact on a child's educational development in some aspects. Their expertise, individualized attention, and role modeling make them uniquely qualified to shape a child's mind and character. As such, it is imperative that we recognize the importance of teachers in our society and provide them with the resources and support they need to perform their duties effectively.
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;The notion that salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers has gained significant traction in recent times. While I acknowledge the importance of financial stability, I firmly believe that there are numerous other aspects that should be accorded equal weight when choosing a job.On one hand, I agree that money is indispensable in meeting our basic needs. A decent salary enables us to provide for our families, pay bills, and maintain a certain standard of living. In this sense, it is understandable why salary is often the primary consideration for many individuals. After all, financial security is a fundamental aspect of life, and a good salary provides a sense of stability and freedom.However, I strongly believe that there are other crucial factors that should not be overlooked when selecting a career. For instance, personal fulfillment and job satisfaction are vital considerations that can significantly impact one's overall well-being. Engaging in a profession that aligns with one's passions and values can lead to a sense of purpose and happiness, which may not be directly correlated with salary. Moreover, work-life balance, opportunities for growth and development, and a supportive work environment are also essential aspects that can greatly influence one's job satisfaction.Furthermore, research has shown that excessive emphasis on salary can lead to burnout and decreased job satisfaction. When individuals prioritize salary over other aspects, they may find themselves in unfulfilling careers that do not provide them with a sense of purpose or happiness. This highlights the importance of considering a range of factors when choosing a job, rather than solely focusing on salary.In conclusion, while salary is undoubtedly a critical consideration, it should not be the sole determining factor when selecting a career. Other aspects such as personal fulfillment, job satisfaction, and work-life balance are equally important and should be given due weight. By considering a range of factors, individuals can make more informed decisions that lead to a more satisfying and fulfilling career.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;The Impact of Cars on the Environment and EconomyThe widespread use of cars has had far-reaching consequences on both the environment and the economy. One of the most significant effects is the severe pressure exerted on the environment due to wasteful oil consumption. The extraction, transportation, and combustion of oil have led to devastating environmental impacts, including air pollution, climate change, and oil spills. Moreover, the increasing demand for oil has resulted in its rising cost, which in turn, has led to a surge in the prices of essential products such as rice, meat, and vegetables.The ripple effect of high oil prices on the economy is profound. As the cost of petrol increases, so does the cost of transporting goods, leading to higher prices for consumers. This has a disproportionate impact on low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income on basic necessities like food and transportation. The consequences of this are far-reaching, with many families struggling to make ends meet.Furthermore, countries that rely heavily on oil imports are at the mercy of oil-exporting nations, both politically and financially. This dependence can lead to a loss of autonomy, as importing countries are forced to comply with the policies and interests of oil-exporting nations. Additionally, the economic instability caused by fluctuating oil prices can have devastating effects on a country's economy, including inflation, unemployment, and even social unrest.In conclusion, the impact of cars on the environment and economy is multifaceted and far-reaching. The wasteful consumption of oil has severe environmental consequences, while the economic effects of high oil prices are felt across the globe. It is imperative that we transition towards more sustainable modes of transportation and reduce our reliance on oil to mitigate these effects. By doing so, we can ensure a more stable and sustainable future for generations to come.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;The rising number of street criminals has led to a growing trend of police officers carrying guns, a development that has sparked widespread concern among the general public. This phenomenon has been interpreted by some individuals as a reflection and intensification of the high level of violence in society. In this essay, we will examine the specific reasons behind this assumption and analyze the underlying factors that contribute to this trend.One of the primary reasons why the increasing number of street criminals has led to police officers carrying guns is the perceived need for self-defense. With the rise in violent crimes, law enforcement officials feel compelled to arm themselves to protect themselves and the public from potential harm. This reaction is understandable, as the primary duty of the police is to maintain law and order, and the presence of firearms can serve as a deterrent to would-be criminals. However, this trend also perpetuates a cycle of violence, where the presence of guns on both sides of the law can escalate conflicts and lead to tragic consequences.Another reason why this trend is seen as a reflection of societal violence is the normalization of gun culture. The proliferation of guns in society has led to a desensitization of their presence, making it more acceptable for law enforcement to carry them as a routine part of their duty. This normalization can contribute to a broader cultural acceptance of violence, where the use of firearms becomes seen as a necessary tool for resolving conflicts. Furthermore, this can also create a power imbalance, where the police are seen as having a monopoly on violence, leading to a further erosion of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.In conclusion, the increasing number of street criminals has led to a growing trend of police officers carrying guns, which is seen by some as a reflection and intensification of societal violence. The need for self-defense and the normalization of gun culture are two primary reasons behind this trend. However, it is essential to address the underlying factors contributing to this phenomenon to break the cycle of violence and work towards creating a safer and more harmonious society.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;The integration of technology in education has revolutionized the way students learn and has been widely accepted as a key factor in improving scholastic performance. From my perspective, the richness and convenience of technology are two primary contributors to this positive impact.On one hand, the richness of technology provides students with an unparalleled wealth of information and resources. With the internet at their fingertips, students can access a vast array of educational materials, including e-books, online tutorials, and educational videos. This abundance of information enables students to delve deeper into subjects that interest them, exploring topics in greater depth and breadth. Moreover, technology facilitates interactive learning experiences, such as simulations, gamification, and virtual labs, which cater to different learning styles and make complex concepts more engaging and accessible.On the other hand, the convenience of technology has transformed the way students approach their studies. Mobile devices and laptops allow students to learn anywhere, anytime, breaking free from the constraints of traditional classroom settings. Online resources and educational apps provide students with the flexibility to review material, complete assignments, and collaborate with peers at their own pace. Additionally, technology automates administrative tasks, such as grading and feedback, freeing up instructors to focus on more personalized and meaningful interactions with students.In conclusion, the richness and convenience of technology have been instrumental in enhancing students' scholastic performances. By providing access to a vast array of information and interactive learning experiences, technology has empowered students to take ownership of their learning. Furthermore, the flexibility and accessibility offered by technology have enabled students to manage their time more effectively, allowing them to balance academic responsibilities with other aspects of their lives.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;The rapid advancement of technology has been a cornerstone of modern society, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with one another. However, some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks, impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view, and in this essay, I will analyze both sides of this argument and provide explanations for my stance.On the one hand, it is undeniable that the exponential growth of technology has led to some negative consequences. For instance, the over-reliance on technology has contributed to social isolation, decreased attention span, and a sedentary lifestyle. Furthermore, the increasing use of technology has also raised concerns about data privacy and security, as well as the potential for technological unemployment. These drawbacks are legitimate and should not be ignored.On the other hand, I firmly believe that the benefits of technological advancements far outweigh the drawbacks. Technology has revolutionized the way we access information, communicate with each other, and has enabled us to work more efficiently. It has also opened up new avenues for education, entertainment, and innovation. Moreover, technology has played a crucial role in improving healthcare, transportation, and other essential services. In my opinion, the advantages of technology have significantly improved the overall quality of our lives.In conclusion, while it is true that technological development has some negative consequences, I strongly disagree with the notion that these drawbacks outweigh the benefits. Instead, I believe that technology has been a driving force for progress and has greatly enhanced our daily lives. By acknowledging both sides of the argument and weighing the evidence, it is clear that the advantages of technology far outweigh the drawbacks. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential that we harness its power to create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";The issue of violence in children's television programs has sparked a heated debate about the role of government in regulating content. On one hand, it is argued that governments should prohibit any type of violent content in children's TV shows to tackle the problem of desensitization to violence. On the other hand, some argue that such a restriction would be a violation of adults' civil liberties, as it would also impact TV shows and movies intended for mature audiences.Proponents of a ban on violent content in children's TV shows argue that, due to their mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Exposure to violent content at a young age can lead to desensitization, making children more prone to aggressive behavior and less empathetic towards others. By prohibiting violent content, governments can help prevent the potential long-term effects of exposure to violence on children's mental and emotional well-being.However, others argue that a blanket ban on violent content would be an overreach of government authority, infringing on the civil liberties of adults. TV shows and movies intended for mature audiences often feature complex themes, including violence, that are meant to spark critical thinking and reflection. A ban on violent content would stifle artistic expression and limit the ability of creators to tackle difficult subjects.To strike a balance between protecting children and preserving artistic freedom, governments could consider implementing stricter age ratings and content guidelines for children's TV shows. This would ensure that parents and caregivers are informed about the content of the shows their children watch, while also respecting the creative freedom of producers. Ultimately, a nuanced approach that takes into account the complexities of the issue is necessary to effectively address the problem of violence in children's television programs.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The recent surge in criminality has become a pressing concern globally. As the world grapples with the rising numbers of criminal cases, some have attributed this trend to the frequent use of guns by law enforcement agencies. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. While the use of firearms by police may contribute to the escalation of violence, I firmly believe that other factors play a more significant role in the increasing level of criminality.One major factor that contributes to the rise in criminality is socioeconomic inequality. In many parts of the world, poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to education and job opportunities have created an environment that fosters criminal behavior. Desperate individuals may turn to crime as a means of survival, and the absence of social mobility perpetuates a cycle of violence and crime.Another significant factor is the breakdown of social structures and community relationships. The erosion of family values, social cohesion, and community trust has led to a lack of support systems, leaving individuals vulnerable to criminal influences. Furthermore, the proliferation of social media and the glorification of violence in popular culture have desensitized society to the consequences of criminal behavior.Additionally, mental health issues, substance abuse, and the lack of effective rehabilitation programs for offenders also play a crucial role in the rising criminality rates. These underlying issues need to be addressed through comprehensive policies and programs that focus on prevention, rehabilitation, and community engagement.In conclusion, while the use of guns by police may contribute to the escalation of violence, it is not the primary cause of the increasing criminality rates. Rather, it is the complex interplay of socioeconomic, cultural, and psychological factors that drives this trend. Addressing these underlying issues is crucial to mitigating the rising tide of criminality and creating safer, more equitable communities.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";The Influence of Classmates on Individual AchievementsWhen it comes to individual achievements, various factors come into play, including family, teachers, and personal motivation. However, one often overlooked yet crucial influence is that of classmates. The impact of peers on a child's academic performance and overall achievements cannot be overstated. From a psychological perspective, the dynamics of a classroom setting create a unique environment that can either propel or hinder a child's success.On one hand, classmates can create a competitive atmosphere that incentivizes children to push themselves to achieve more. When surrounded by peers who are striving for excellence, a child is more likely to feel motivated to keep up and even surpass their peers. This sense of competition can foster a growth mindset, encouraging children to take on new challenges and develop a strong work ethic. As children see their peers achieving academic success, they are inspired to work harder and strive for similar recognition.On the other hand, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers can exert enormous pressure on children's academic performances. When a child perceives themselves as less capable or less intelligent than their peers, they may experience anxiety, low self-esteem, and a lack of confidence. This can lead to a fixed mindset, where children become discouraged and disengage from the learning process. Furthermore, the fear of being overshadowed by their peers can cause children to feel inadequate, leading to decreased motivation and a lower sense of self-worth.In conclusion, classmates play a significant role in shaping individual achievements. The competitive atmosphere they create can either inspire children to reach new heights or exert pressure that hinders their progress.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;The world is witnessing a rapid urbanization trend, with an increasing number of people migrating to big cities in search of better opportunities and a higher standard of living. While city life has its advantages, such as access to modern amenities, employment opportunities, and cultural diversity, it also has a dark side. One of the significant drawbacks of city living is its adverse impact on people's health.Environmental pollution is one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. The high concentration of vehicles, industries, and construction activities in cities leads to a significant increase in air pollution, noise pollution, and water pollution. The air in cities is often filled with toxic fumes, particulate matter, and other pollutants that can cause respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer. The noise pollution from traffic, construction, and other urban activities can lead to hearing loss, stress, and anxiety.Furthermore, the water pollution in cities is a significant concern, with many cities struggling to provide clean drinking water to their residents. The pollution of water sources, such as rivers and lakes, can lead to waterborne diseases, such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery. In addition to environmental pollution, city life also contributes to a sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy eating habits, and increased stress levels, all of which can negatively impact people's physical and mental health.In conclusion, while city life may offer many benefits, its negative impact on people's health cannot be ignored. Environmental pollution, in particular, is a significant concern that needs to be addressed through effective policies and measures. Governments, urban planners, and individuals must work together to create healthier and more sustainable cities that promote the well-being of their residents. This can be achieved by investing in clean energy, improving public transportation, promoting green spaces, and implementing effective waste management systems. Only then can we ensure that the benefits of city life are not outweighed by its negative consequences.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;The debate surrounding the authorization of policemen to carry firearms has sparked intense discussion. While some individuals argue that this practice can lead to increased violence in society, it is crucial to examine the root causes of gun violence and the most effective strategies for controlling crime.One key point often overlooked is that most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. According to studies, a significant portion of firearms used in violent crimes were initially acquired through unlawful means. This suggests that the primary issue lies not with the weapons themselves, but rather with the individuals who choose to misuse them. In this light, it is misguided to focus solely on restricting access to firearms, as this does not address the underlying problem of illegal gun circulation.Instead, governments seeking to control crime in their communities should focus on managing the actions of their citizens. This can be achieved through a multifaceted approach that incorporates education, community engagement, and targeted law enforcement strategies. By fostering a culture of respect for the law and promoting positive relationships between law enforcement and the community, governments can effectively reduce the likelihood of violent crimes.Moreover, equipping policemen with firearms can actually serve as a deterrent to potential criminals. The visible presence of armed officers can instill a sense of security among law-abiding citizens, while also sending a strong message to those who would contemplate committing crimes. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance between maintaining public safety and respecting individual rights. By addressing the root causes of gun violence and implementing comprehensive crime prevention strategies, governments can create safer, more harmonious communities for all.
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;In developing countries, access to education remains a significant challenge for many families. The financial burden of sending children to school can be overwhelming, forcing parents to make difficult choices between their children's education and basic necessities. However, it is essential to recognize that development through education encompasses more than just producing a workforce of doctors, lawyers, and engineers. A well-informed and educated individual can have a profound impact on their community and society at large.Development through education is not solely about creating a specialized workforce but rather about cultivating a population that can think critically, make informed decisions, and participate actively in the democratic process. A well-informed individual can act sensibly and make sound judgments, which is crucial for the growth and prosperity of a nation. They can engage in discussions, debates, and decision-making processes that shape their community's future. Moreover, education empowers individuals to make informed choices about their health, well-being, and financial stability, leading to a more stable and secure society.Furthermore, education can have a ripple effect, influencing not just individuals but also their families and communities. When one person is educated, they can share their knowledge and skills with others, creating a multiplier effect that can transform entire communities. Education can also foster a sense of civic responsibility, encouraging individuals to participate in community development initiatives, volunteer, and take ownership of their community's progress.In conclusion, while access to education remains a significant challenge in developing countries, its importance cannot be overstated. Development through education is not just about creating a specialized workforce but about cultivating a well-informed, critically thinking, and engaged population. By recognizing the value of education beyond its economic benefits, we can work towards creating a more informed, participatory, and equitable society, where every individual has the opportunity to thrive and contribute to their community's growth and prosperity.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";"The impact of celebrities on adolescents has been a topic of concern for many. Some argue that young people are being influenced by untalented individuals who achieve fame solely due to their luxurious lifestyles and wealth. However, this perspective underestimates the discerning nature of the current young generation.In today's society, adolescents are remarkably conscious of the lifestyles they aspire to emulate. They are not simply swayed by material wealth or fame; instead, they look up to role models who embody positive values and achievements. The young generation is equipped with a critical eye, analyzing the characters and actions of those they admire. This critical thinking skill is a testament to the effective upbringing and education they receive, which emphasizes not just academic excellence but also life skills, emotional intelligence, and character building.Moreover, the notion that many individuals can thrive in the celebrity world without any discernible talent or achievement is an exaggeration. The reality is that even those who initially gain fame due to their wealth or lifestyle eventually need to demonstrate some level of talent or contribute something meaningful to sustain their public appeal. The entertainment industry, while occasionally seeming superficial, demands a level of skill, creativity, and hard work for lasting success.Therefore, while it's true that some adolescents might be influenced by less-than-ideal celebrities, the vast majority of young people today are too savvy and ambitious to be swayed by fleeting fame or wealth. They look for substance, talent, and positive role models to aspire towards. It's time to acknowledge the resilience and wisdom of the young generation, who are not easily influenced but are instead choosing their heroes wisely."
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;The widespread use of mobile phones has revolutionized the way people communicate, access information, and navigate their daily lives. With the constant availability of these devices, people of all ages have become increasingly dependent on them. However, I firmly believe that this great invention of the 21st century has also brought about a multitude of problems that affect our society in profound ways.One of the most significant issues caused by excessive mobile phone usage is the adverse effect it has on our social skills. Spending too much time on mobile phones leads to a decline in face-to-face interactions, which are essential for building and maintaining meaningful relationships. When individuals are glued to their screens, they miss out on opportunities to engage in conversations, read nonverbal cues, and develop empathy – all crucial components of effective communication. As a result, people may struggle to form deep connections with others, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.Furthermore, excessive mobile phone usage can also impact our mental health. The constant stream of information and notifications can lead to increased stress levels, anxiety, and decreased attention span. Additionally, the comparison culture perpetuated by social media can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. It is imperative that we acknowledge these consequences and take steps to mitigate them.In conclusion, while mobile phones have undoubtedly transformed the way we live, it is essential to recognize the potential problems they pose to our society. By being mindful of our mobile phone usage and making a conscious effort to balance screen time with face-to-face interactions, we can work towards maintaining healthy relationships, improving our mental well-being, and fostering a more harmonious society.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;The debate about who should take responsibility for protecting the environment has sparked intense discussion in recent years. One viewpoint posits that governments and large corporations should bear the burden of environmental conservation, leaving ordinary citizens exempt from this responsibility. Proponents of this argument contend that solving environmental problems often requires vast financial resources and cutting-edge technologies, which are typically beyond the means of individual citizens.Indeed, large-scale environmental initiatives, such as cleaning up polluted industrial sites or implementing sustainable infrastructure, do necessitate significant investments and specialized expertise. Governments and corporations, with their substantial resources and technological capabilities, are well-positioned to undertake such endeavors. Moreover, their influence and authority enable them to enact and enforce policies that can mitigate environmental degradation on a broader scale.However, this perspective does not entirely absolve ordinary citizens from environmental responsibility. While individuals may not be able to single-handedly resolve complex environmental issues, they can still contribute to conservation efforts in meaningful ways. For instance, participating in community clean-up initiatives, reducing energy consumption, and adopting eco-friendly habits can collectively make a significant impact. Furthermore, individuals can also benefit directly from environmental improvements, such as enjoying cleaner air and water, and experiencing the aesthetic and recreational value of preserved natural spaces.Ultimately, environmental protection is a collective responsibility that requires a multifaceted approach. While governments and corporations should indeed assume a significant role in addressing environmental challenges, ordinary citizens also have a vital part to play. By acknowledging the importance of individual actions and fostering a culture of environmental stewardship, we can work together to create a more sustainable future for all.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;The media's portrayal of crime has long been a subject of debate. While crime coverage can serve as a necessary tool for informing the public and promoting awareness, a great deal of it is unfortunately biased, exaggerated, or even fraudulent. This sensationalized reporting can have devastating consequences, terrorizing communities and leaving law-abiding citizens increasingly apprehensive about crime.One of the primary concerns with detailed crime coverage is that it can inadvertently provide potential criminals with instructive learning materials. By meticulously reporting on the methods and techniques used in crimes, the media may be unwittingly providing a roadmap for those who seek to engage in similar unlawful activities. This can be particularly problematic, as such information would be difficult to obtain through other means. As a result, the lack of restraint in reporting on criminal details can have the unintended consequence of exacerbating the very problems it seeks to highlight.Moreover, the absence of self-regulation in crime reporting can lead to a culture of fear and mistrust. When the media focuses on the most sensational and disturbing aspects of crime, it can create a distorted view of reality, leading to increased anxiety and a breakdown in social harmony. This, in turn, can have a corrosive effect on community cohesion and social order. Ultimately, the media has a responsibility to report on crime in a responsible and balanced manner, one that prioritizes the well-being and safety of the community over the pursuit of ratings and sensationalism.By adopting a more measured approach to crime reporting, the media can help to promote a more informed and aware public, while also contributing to the maintenance of social harmony and the prevention of further unlawful behavior.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. Despite the convenience of up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning.On one hand, the advancement of technology has led to a decline in the emphasis on teaching handwriting in schools. Many believe that with the widespread use of keyboards and touchscreens, the need to write by hand is becoming obsolete. However, this perspective overlooks the significant benefits that handwriting provides to students’ learning experience.Research has shown that handwriting plays a crucial role in cognitive development, particularly in the areas of literacy and numeracy. Writing by hand helps students to better retain information, as it engages multiple senses and strengthens the connection between the brain and the hand. Moreover, handwriting allows students to express their thoughts and ideas more freely, which is essential for creative writing and problem-solving.On the other hand, poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students’ school performance. Illegible handwriting can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can affect students’ grades and overall academic progress. Moreover, poor handwriting can also lead to a lack of confidence and motivation, as students may feel embarrassed or frustrated with their inability to write legibly.In conclusion, despite the convenience of modern technology, teaching handwriting remains a vital part of students’ education. It not only aids in cognitive development but also plays a significant role in students’ academic performance. Therefore, it is essential that schools continue to prioritize handwriting instruction, ensuring that students develop this essential skill and reap its many benefits. By doing so, we can help students to succeed academically and reach their full potential.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";The debate surrounding the taxation of private school attendees has sparked intense discussion in recent years. On one hand, some individuals who send their children to private schools argue that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. They contend that they already contribute significantly to the state's education system through their taxes, yet they choose to invest in private education for their children. From their perspective, it is unfair to expect them to pay the same amount of taxes as those who utilize the state education system.On the other hand, affluent people who opt for private schools effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between the rich and the poor. By choosing to enroll their children in private schools, they free up spaces in the state education system, allowing children from lower-income families to access quality education. This subtle redistribution of resources can have a positive impact on social mobility and equality.However, the proposal of tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools raises concerns about the efficient allocation of public capital. If the government were to offer tax reductions to these parents, it would likely lead to a waste of public capital. The funds allocated for tax reductions could be better utilized to improve the state education system, benefiting a larger number of students. Furthermore, such a policy could exacerbate existing inequalities, as it would primarily benefit affluent families who can already afford private education.In conclusion, while the argument for tax reduction for private school attendees may seem compelling, it is essential to consider the broader implications of such a policy. The potential waste of public capital and the exacerbation of existing inequalities outweigh the perceived benefits of this proposal. Instead, policymakers should focus on improving the state education system, ensuring that all students, regardless of their background, have access to quality education.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;The debate over whether governments should prioritize investing in public services or the arts has been ongoing, with some arguing that the former should take precedence over the latter. In my opinion, both public services and arts are worthy of investment, and it is not necessarily a question of one over the other.On one hand, public services such as hospitals and schools are indispensable to the well-being of society. These institutions provide essential services that are crucial to the health, education, and overall quality of life of citizens. Investing in these services is not only a moral imperative, but also a sound economic strategy. By providing quality healthcare and education, governments can ensure a healthy and skilled workforce, which in turn can drive economic growth and prosperity. Moreover, public services are often the backbone of a functioning society, and their absence or inadequacy can have severe consequences, such as poor health outcomes and low literacy rates.On the other hand, arts such as music and theatre are also essential to a society's cultural and emotional well-being. They provide a platform for self-expression, creativity, and social commentary, and can bring people together in ways that transcend socio-economic boundaries. Arts also have a significant economic impact, with the creative industries contributing billions to national economies each year. Furthermore, arts can play a critical role in preserving cultural heritage and promoting national identity.In conclusion, both public services and arts are worthy of investment. Rather than pitting one against the other, governments should strive to strike a balance between the two. By investing in both, governments can ensure a holistic approach to development, one that prioritizes the well-being of citizens while also promoting creativity, cultural diversity, and economic growth. Ultimately, a society that values both public services and arts is a society that values the well-rounded development of its citizens.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;The advent of modern technology has brought about a profound impact on traditional cultural practices. On one hand, the relentless march of technology has led to the erosion of many old, traditionally cultural things. The widespread use of digital communication tools, for instance, has replaced traditional forms of storytelling, which were once an integral part of cultural heritage. Similarly, the increased accessibility of modern entertainment options has diminished the appeal of traditional performing arts, such as folk music and dance. Furthermore, the homogenization of global culture, facilitated by the internet, has led to the loss of unique cultural identities and customs.However, despite these drawbacks, technology has also made significant contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures. Digital platforms, for example, have enabled the preservation and dissemination of cultural knowledge and traditions. Online archives and museums have made it possible to digitize and share cultural artifacts, texts, and images, thereby ensuring their preservation for future generations. Moreover, digital tools have facilitated the study and analysis of cultural practices, allowing researchers to better understand and appreciate the complexities of traditional cultures.In addition, technology has also enabled the revival and promotion of traditional cultural practices. Social media platforms, for instance, have provided a space for cultural enthusiasts to share and showcase their cultural heritage, thereby raising awareness and appreciation for traditional cultures. Moreover, digital technologies have also enabled the creation of virtual cultural events and festivals, which have helped to promote cultural exchange and understanding.In conclusion, while modern technology has undoubtedly led to the erosion of many traditional cultural practices, it has also made significant contributions to their maintenance and study. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential that we harness its potential to preserve and promote our cultural heritage, rather than allowing it to further erode our traditional cultural practices.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;The debate about university enrollment policies has sparked a contentious discussion regarding gender parity in various faculties. One perspective advocates for equal enrollment of male and female students in each faculty, while others argue that this approach may not be practical or beneficial.On one hand, it is true that many boys tend to gravitate towards science and technology fields, while girls often show a stronger inclination towards literature, education, and arts. This natural tendency can be attributed to a combination of factors, including societal influences, personal interests, and aptitudes. As a result, imposing a strict gender quota in each faculty may not only be challenging to implement but also potentially limiting to students who wish to pursue their genuine passions.On the other hand, it is essential for universities to encourage and support students in exploring diverse fields, regardless of their gender. This is particularly important for promoting gender equality and breaking down stereotypes. By actively promoting science subjects to female students and humanities to male students, universities can play a pivotal role in shaping a more balanced and inclusive academic environment.Ultimately, rather than enforcing equal enrollment numbers, universities should focus on fostering an atmosphere that encourages students to pursue their interests without gender bias. This can be achieved through targeted outreach programs, scholarships, and mentorship initiatives that cater to students from underrepresented groups. By adopting such an approach, universities can ensure that students are empowered to make informed choices about their academic paths, while also promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;The lives of celebrities, such as movie stars, are constantly scrutinized by the media, often portraying them as living in luxury and indulging in lavish lifestyles. While this may seem glamorous and exciting, I strongly believe that this trend has a worrying and negative impact on children.The first impression that children often get of celebrities is that they are wealthy and successful without having to put in much effort. This can create a false narrative that hard work and dedication are not necessary to achieve success. Children may begin to think that they too can live a life of luxury and ease without having to study hard or work towards their goals. This mindset can lead to a lack of motivation and a poor work ethic, ultimately hindering their future prospects.Moreover, not all celebrities are positive role models for children to look up to. Many are often portrayed as reckless and irresponsible, with their personal lives and relationships being splashed across the headlines. This can lead to children emulating their behavior, adopting unhealthy attitudes and values that can have long-term consequences. Furthermore, the constant bombardment of celebrity news and gossip can create unrealistic expectations and promote a culture of superficiality, where physical appearance and material possessions are valued above all else.It is essential for children to have positive role models in their lives, individuals who demonstrate the importance of hard work, education, and responsibility. Parents, teachers, and other influential figures should promote these values and provide children with a balanced perspective on the lives of celebrities. By doing so, we can help children develop a more realistic understanding of what it takes to achieve success and encourage them to work towards their goals with dedication and perseverance.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. The welfare state, which emerged in the mid-20th century, is based on the principle that the government has a responsibility to ensure the well-being of its citizens, including their health. As such, governments are expected to provide access to quality healthcare and health education to all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic status.However, the current healthcare system in many countries focuses more on treatment rather than prevention. Governments allocate a larger proportion of their budget to treating illnesses rather than preventing them. This approach is not only costly but also unsustainable in the long run. Treating illnesses is a reactive approach that only addresses the symptoms of the problem rather than the root cause.On the other hand, investing in health education and prevention can have long-term benefits for individuals, communities, and the economy as a whole. By educating citizens on healthy lifestyles, nutrition, and disease prevention, governments can reduce the burden on the healthcare system. Preventive measures such as vaccinations, screenings, and health checks can also detect illnesses early, reducing the need for costly treatments.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment. By doing so, governments can create a sustainable healthcare system that prioritizes the well-being of its citizens. This approach not only saves costs but also improves health outcomes, increases productivity, and enhances the overall quality of life. It is time for governments to shift their focus from treating illnesses to preventing them, and investing in health education and prevention is the first step towards achieving this goal.
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;In today's fast-paced world, raising children has become an increasingly daunting task for families. While the role of mothers in a child's life is undeniable, I firmly believe that fatherhood is equally vital to a child's healthy development as motherhood. The traditional notion of mothers being the primary caregivers has been challenged in recent years, and for good reason. Fathers play a unique and essential role in shaping their children's lives, and their influence should not be underestimated.Research has consistently shown that children who have involved and engaged fathers tend to perform better academically, socially, and emotionally. Fathers bring a distinct set of skills and perspectives to the table, providing a complementary influence to that of mothers. They often encourage independence, risk-taking, and exploration, which are essential for a child's cognitive and emotional growth. Moreover, fathers can serve as positive male role models, teaching children important values such as responsibility, respect, and self-discipline.Furthermore, the presence of a loving and supportive father can have a profound impact on a child's self-esteem and confidence. Children who have a strong bond with their fathers tend to have better relationships with their peers and are more likely to develop healthy relationships in adulthood. In contrast, fatherless homes are often associated with a range of negative outcomes, including increased rates of poverty, delinquency, and mental health problems.In conclusion, while the role of mothers is undoubtedly essential, fatherhood is equally vital to a child's healthy development. Fathers bring a unique set of skills and perspectives to the table, providing a complementary influence to that of mothers. As a society, we should recognize the importance of involved and engaged fatherhood, and provide support and resources to fathers who want to play a more active role in their children's lives. By doing so, we can help ensure that children receive the balanced and nurturing upbringing they need to thrive.
