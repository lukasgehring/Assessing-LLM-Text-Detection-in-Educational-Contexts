0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;When it comes to the debate on whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate, opinions are divided. While some argue that competition is essential for a child's development, others believe that cooperation is the key to raising useful adults. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and argue that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial.On the one hand, competition can effectively promote the development of the economy and drive individuals to achieve their best. In a competitive environment, children are motivated to work hard, strive for excellence, and push themselves to succeed. This, in turn, can lead to innovation, progress, and economic growth. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation in the context of childhood education, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but rather the individual child's development and well-being.On the other hand, teaching children to cooperate has numerous benefits that outweigh the advantages of competition. Through cooperation, children can learn essential interpersonal skills, such as communication, empathy, and teamwork. These skills are significant in the future life of all students, as they will be working with others in various settings, from academics to professions. Cooperation also fosters a sense of community, mutual respect, and trust, which are vital for building strong relationships and achieving common goals.In conclusion, while competition has its benefits, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more important for their development into useful adults. By learning to work together, children can develop essential life skills, build strong relationships, and become active, responsible, and caring members of society.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;In recent decades, the world has witnessed a significant surge in migration, with millions of people crossing borders in search of better opportunities. As a result, the issue of integration into the host country's society has become a pressing concern. While some argue that immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs to integrate into their adopted countries, I strongly disagree with this notion. I firmly believe that immigrants can sustain their cultural identities while still becoming an integral part of their new societies.The last 50 years have seen an unprecedented increase in immigration, with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures settling in foreign lands. Some argue that to integrate into their adopted countries' cultures, immigrants should abandon their old customs and adopt the local way of life. However, I strongly disagree with this stance. Maintaining one's cultural identity is not only a fundamental human right, but also a crucial aspect of an individual's self-expression and sense of belonging.Forcing immigrants to abandon their cultural heritage would not only lead to cultural homogenization but also result in the loss of valuable diversity that immigrants bring to their new societies. Moreover, preserving one's cultural identity helps individuals to maintain their origin values and traditions, which are essential for their mental and emotional well-being in a foreign environment. In multicultural societies, the coexistence of different cultures enriches the social fabric and fosters mutual understanding and respect.In conclusion, I strongly believe that immigrants can sustain their cultural identities while still integrating into their adopted countries. By embracing their cultural heritage, immigrants can contribute to the rich tapestry of multiculturalism, enriching their new societies with their unique perspectives and traditions.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;International tourism has become a widespread phenomenon, with millions of people traveling to various parts of the world to experience natural wonders, ancient heritages, and diverse cultures. While some individuals may view this trend as detrimental to the host countries, I firmly believe that international tourism has contributed significantly to economic development, cultural preservation, and environmental conservation.In the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in the number of tourists visiting natural wonder sights, ancient heritages, and immersing themselves in different cultures. This surge in tourism has generated a considerable amount of revenue for the destination countries, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. For instance, the tourism industry has become a vital sector in many developing countries, providing a significant source of foreign exchange earnings and contributing to their overall economic growth.Moreover, international tourism has played a crucial role in preserving the cultural heritage of tourist destinations. The revenue generated from tourism has enabled local authorities to restore and maintain historical sites, museums, and cultural festivals, thereby safeguarding the cultural identity of these nations. Furthermore, tourism has also raised awareness about the importance of cultural preservation, encouraging locals and visitors alike to appreciate and respect the unique customs and traditions of the host countries.In addition to economic and cultural benefits, international tourism has also contributed to environmental conservation. The influx of tourists has created a demand for sustainable tourism practices, prompting local governments and tour operators to adopt eco-friendly policies and invest in conservation efforts. This has led to the protection of natural habitats, wildlife reserves, and national parks, which might have otherwise been exploited for their natural resources.In conclusion, while some people may argue that international tourism has negative consequences, I strongly believe that it has made significant contributions to the economic development, cultural preservation, and environmental conservation of tourist destinations. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is essential to recognize the benefits of international tourism and work towards ensuring that it continues to be a positive force for years to come.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;The last 50 years have witnessed a significant surge in international tourism, with millions of people traveling across the globe each year. This trend has sparked a heated debate, with some hailing it as a positive development and others expressing concerns about its impact. In my opinion, while international tourism has its benefits, it also poses significant risks to the cultural and environmental heritage of tourist destinations.On the positive side, international tourism can be a powerful tool for economic development and cultural exchange. It creates jobs, stimulates local economies, and fosters cross-cultural understanding and tolerance. Many countries rely heavily on tourism as a source of revenue, and it has lifted millions of people out of poverty. Additionally, tourism can promote cultural preservation and exchange, allowing people to experience and appreciate different customs, traditions, and ways of life.However, the sheer volume of tourists can also have devastating consequences if not managed properly. The influx of visitors can put immense pressure on local infrastructure, leading to strain on resources, pollution, and environmental degradation. Moreover, the commercialization of cultural heritage sites can lead to the erosion of traditional values and the loss of authenticity. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.To mitigate these risks, governments and tourism boards must adopt sustainable tourism practices, such as implementing strict environmental regulations, managing tourist numbers, and promoting eco-friendly accommodations. Moreover, local communities must be involved in the decision-making process to ensure that tourism benefits them directly and does not compromise their way of life.In conclusion, while international tourism has its benefits, it is crucial that we acknowledge the risks associated with it and take proactive steps to mitigate them. By adopting sustainable tourism practices, we can ensure that the cultural and environmental heritage of tourist destinations is preserved for future generations to enjoy.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;The idea of pursuing university study abroad is an enticing prospect for many students. However, some people believe that the difficulties of living and studying in a different culture outweigh the benefits, and it is better to stay home. I disagree with this statement, as I believe that studying abroad offers numerous advantages that can enhance one's skills and personal growth.On the one hand, some students may prefer to study at home due to the difficulties of living and studying overseas. Adapting to a new culture, language, and academic system can be overwhelming. Moreover, students may face challenges such as homesickness, financial constraints, and navigating unfamiliar surroundings. These difficulties can undoubtedly hinder a student's ability to focus on their studies.On the other hand, in my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons. Firstly, studying abroad allows students to develop language proficiency and cultural competence. Immersing oneself in a foreign culture enables students to become proficient in a new language, understand different customs and traditions, and develop a global perspective. Secondly, studying overseas provides students with the opportunity to develop independence, self-reliance, and problem-solving skills. By navigating unfamiliar surroundings and overcoming challenges, students can become more confident and resourceful individuals. Finally, studying abroad offers students the chance to build a global network of friends, colleagues, and mentors, which can be beneficial for future career prospects.In conclusion, while studying overseas may present difficulties, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. By studying abroad, students can gain valuable skills such as language proficiency, cultural competence, independence, and problem-solving skills. These skills are essential for success in today's globalized world, and I firmly believe that the experience of studying overseas is an invaluable investment in one's personal and professional growth.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;The world has become increasingly interconnected, and as a result, many students are now choosing to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Studying abroad has become a popular option for students seeking to broaden their horizons, and for good reason. Not only do students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally, but they also develop valuable life skills that will benefit them in the long run.One of the primary reasons students choose to study abroad is the personal growth and development that comes with living in a new country. Living in an unfamiliar environment requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character, as students must navigate new customs, languages, and ways of life. This challenges them to step out of their comfort zone and develop important life skills such as independence, resilience, and problem-solving. As a result, students who study abroad often return home with increased confidence and self-reliance.Another important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. Studying abroad provides students with the opportunity to learn from renowned professors, engage with diverse perspectives, and access state-of-the-art facilities and resources. This not only enhances their academic knowledge but also broadens their understanding of different teaching methods and academic cultures. Furthermore, studying abroad provides students with a competitive edge in the job market, as employers increasingly value the skills and experience that come with international study.In conclusion, studying abroad offers students a unique opportunity for personal, academic, and cultural growth. By living in a new country, students develop valuable life skills such as flexibility, adaptability, and independence. Additionally, they gain access to new academic experiences and opportunities that can enhance their knowledge and employability. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, studying abroad is an option that is definitely worth considering.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The rise in popularity of the internet has led to a shift in the way people consume information, with many speculating that newspapers will soon become a relic of the past. To a large extent, I agree with this sentiment.In recent years, the internet has become an increasingly popular source of information, providing people with a vast array of news and knowledge at their fingertips. This has undoubtedly led to a decline in the popularity of newspapers, as people turn to the internet for their news fix. Some people still believe that newspapers can exist for a long time, perhaps due to their tactile nature and the ability to provide in-depth analysis and commentary. However, I believe that the internet has simply become a more convenient and efficient way to obtain information.Using the internet to obtain information is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. News is updated in real-time on the internet, allowing people to stay up-to-date with the latest developments as they happen. In contrast, newspapers are often published on a daily or weekly basis, meaning that the information they contain can quickly become outdated. Furthermore, the internet allows people to access a vast array of news sources, providing them with a more comprehensive understanding of current events.While some may lament the decline of newspapers, I believe that it is a natural consequence of the rise of the internet. The convenience, speed, and accessibility of online news have simply made newspapers a less appealing option for many people. As technology continues to advance and the internet becomes even more ingrained in our daily lives, it is likely that newspapers will become increasingly obsolete.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";The development of a country is closely tied to the quality of its education system. Education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. The question of how a government should allocate its budget between young children's education and universities is a pressing one. While some may argue that universities can support themselves through donations or inventions, this argument is invalid. In reality, a government should spare effort on both young children's education and universities, as both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.Early childhood education lays the foundation for a child's future academic success and shapes their social and emotional development. Research has shown that investing in early childhood education has long-term benefits, including improved academic achievement, better social skills, and increased economic productivity. By prioritizing young children's education, a government can set the stage for a well-educated and skilled workforce, which is essential for a country's economic growth and competitiveness.On the other hand, universities are the hubs of innovation and intellectual inquiry, producing graduates who are equipped to drive economic growth, solve complex problems, and address societal challenges. Universities also play a critical role in advancing knowledge and technology, which is essential for a country's long-term prosperity. Moreover, universities are often the engines of innovation, driving entrepreneurship, and job creation.In conclusion, for successful development of a country, a government should focus its budget on both young children's education and universities. Both are essential for building a strong foundation for a country's prosperity. By prioritizing education at all levels, a government can ensure that its citizens are equipped with the skills, knowledge, and creativity needed to drive economic growth, innovation, and societal progress.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";As a student, living with roommates is a common experience, especially during university years. Having a good roommate can make a significant difference in one's academic and personal life. In my personal opinion, being considerate is the most important quality of a roommate.Consideration is essential in a shared living space. A considerate roommate respects their partner's privacy, belongings, and personal space. For instance, if one roommate is studying for an exam, a considerate roommate will keep noise levels down and avoid disturbing them. This level of consideration creates a harmonious and peaceful living environment, allowing both roommates to focus on their studies and personal activities.In the meantime, communication is another essential particularity of a good roommate. Effective communication helps prevent misunderstandings and resolves conflicts. A good roommate will communicate their needs, concerns, and boundaries clearly, ensuring that both roommates are on the same page. For example, if one roommate is planning a party, they will communicate with their partner to ensure that they are comfortable with the noise and guest levels. Open communication also fosters a sense of trust and respect, leading to a stronger and more supportive roommate relationship.Other important qualities of a good roommate include reliability, cleanliness, and respect for shared spaces. A reliable roommate will fulfill their responsibilities, such as paying rent on time and contributing to household chores. A clean and tidy roommate will maintain a hygienic living environment, ensuring that both roommates feel comfortable and relaxed in their home. Respect for shared spaces, such as the kitchen and bathroom, is also crucial, as it demonstrates consideration for one's roommate's needs and personal space.In conclusion, being considerate and communicative are essential qualities of a good roommate. These traits create a harmonious and respectful living environment, allowing both roommates to thrive academically and personally. By valuing these qualities, students can find a positive and supportive roommate experience that enhances their university years.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;As the world grapples with the challenges of urbanization, climate change, and sustainability, governments face a critical decision: where to allocate their transportation budget. While some argue that investing in roads and highways is the way forward, I firmly believe that governments should prioritize improving public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and subways.The primary reason for this is to alleviate traffic congestion, a perennial problem in many cities. By investing in public transportation, governments can encourage citizens to leave their personal vehicles behind, reducing the number of cars and motorbikes on the road. This, in turn, decreases travel times, making commutes faster and more efficient. Moreover, a robust public transportation system can accommodate a larger number of passengers, further reducing the reliance on private vehicles.Another compelling argument for investing in public transportation is its environmental benefits. The more cars and motorbikes on the road, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. In contrast, buses, trains, and subways are a cleaner alternative, producing significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions per passenger. By promoting the use of these modes of transportation, governments can contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change.Investing in buses, trains, and subways also has economic benefits. Not only can it create jobs in the construction and maintenance of these systems, but it can also stimulate local economies by connecting cities and towns, facilitating the movement of people and goods.In conclusion, investing in public transportation is a sound decision for governments. It can help alleviate traffic congestion, reduce carbon emissions, and stimulate local economies. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, it is imperative that governments prioritize sustainable, efficient, and environmentally-friendly transportation solutions. By doing so, they can create a better future for their citizens and for generations to come.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";The debate surrounding the inclusion of physical exercise in the school curriculum has been ongoing, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. As someone who values a holistic approach to education, I firmly believe that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day.First and foremost, the direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises cannot be overstated. Regular physical activity has been shown to have a profound impact on both physical and mental well-being. The more we practice, the better we feel, and this, in turn, has a positive effect on our academic performance and overall quality of life. By incorporating physical exercise into the school day, students can develop healthy habits from a young age, setting them up for a lifetime of wellness.Moreover, when we engage in physical activities, whether outdoors or indoors, many aspects of life become clearer. Sports and exercise have been shown to improve cognitive function, boost concentration, and enhance creativity. These benefits can have a ripple effect, positively impacting academic performance and personal growth. Additionally, participating in team sports can foster essential life skills such as teamwork, communication, and discipline, all of which are vital for success in various areas of life.Furthermore, the financial sustainability of a region is often linked to the health of its population. A sedentary lifestyle can lead to a plethora of health problems, resulting in significant economic burdens on the healthcare system. By promoting physical exercise in schools, we can help mitigate these costs and cultivate a healthier, more productive workforce.In conclusion, while academic studies are undoubtedly crucial, I firmly believe that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. The benefits of regular physical activity are multifaceted, impacting not only individual health and wellbeing but also the broader economic and social fabric of our communities. By prioritizing physical exercise, we can empower students to lead healthier, more productive lives, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable future.
11;Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the telephone have changed the way that nations interact with each other in a global society. Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.;The advent of advanced transportation and communication technologies, such as airplanes and telephones, has revolutionized the way nations interact with each other in a global society. One technological innovation that I believe is particularly important is the internet. The internet has had a profound impact on global communication, commerce, and education, and has enabled instant connectivity and information exchange across the world.One of the most beneficial results of the internet is email, which has transformed the way people communicate with each other. Email has made it possible for individuals to send and receive messages instantly, regardless of their geographical location. This has had a significant impact on global communication, enabling people to stay in touch with each other easily and facilitating international collaboration and business transactions.The internet has also made it easier for students to apply for foreign universities. With the click of a button, students can now access information about universities, submit applications, and communicate with admissions officers from all over the world. This has opened up new opportunities for students to pursue higher education abroad, fostering global understanding and exchange.Furthermore, the internet has enabled biomedical engineers to collaborate and share information globally, leading to significant advancements in medical research and development. The internet has facilitated the exchange of ideas, research findings, and best practices, enabling biomedical engineers to make a significant impact on increasing life expectancy worldwide. For instance, online platforms have enabled researchers to share data and collaborate on projects, leading to breakthroughs in diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's.In conclusion, the internet is a technological innovation that has had a profound impact on global communication, commerce, and education. Its benefits, including email, have transformed the way people interact with each other, and have enabled new opportunities for global collaboration and exchange.
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;The rapid advancement of technology has led to a heated debate about its impact on children's creativity. While some people argue that technology has made children less creative than they were in the past, I disagree with this statement. Although I acknowledge that technology may have some negative effects on children, I firmly believe that it has also inspired children to create new things and widened their knowledge.On one hand, it is undeniable that excessive screen time and reliance on technology can stifle children's creativity. Spending too much time playing video games, watching TV, or browsing social media can limit their imagination and problem-solving skills. However, this is not a reason to dismiss the potential benefits of technology on children's creativity. In fact, technology has provided children with a wealth of opportunities to express themselves creatively. For instance, digital art software, music production tools, and writing apps have made it easier for children to create and showcase their work.Moreover, technology has widened children's knowledge and opened up new avenues for exploration. The internet has made it possible for children to access a vast array of educational resources, from online museums to interactive science websites. This has enabled them to learn about various subjects and topics, which can inspire creativity and curiosity. Furthermore, technology has also connected children with other young people around the world, allowing them to share ideas and learn from each other's experiences.In conclusion, while technology may have some negative effects on children, I firmly believe that it has also inspired children to create new things and widened their knowledge. Rather than seeing technology as a hindrance to creativity, we should harness its potential to foster imagination, innovation, and learning.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;The role of teachers in shaping students' learning experiences is undeniable. Despite the proliferation of alternative sources of information, such as the internet and television, many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. In my opinion, I agree that traditional teaching methods continue to hold significant value in the learning process.Proponents of this view argue that teachers teach students the fundamental skills of writing, reading, and calculating from a very early age, starting from kindergarten. These skills form the foundation upon which future knowledge is built. Without a solid grasp of these basic skills, students may struggle to comprehend and apply more complex concepts later on. Moreover, teachers provide students with personalized attention and guidance, helping them to identify areas where they need improvement and offering tailored support to address these weaknesses.On the other hand, students gain most of their knowledge through teachers, who not only impart academic information but also instill important values and principles. Teachers play a crucial role in shaping students' moral compass, teaching them what is right and wrong, and promoting critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In a world where information is readily available online, the need for discerning and critically evaluating sources is more pressing than ever. Teachers are well-positioned to model these skills and help students develop the ability to distinguish between fact and fiction, and to think independently.In conclusion, while alternative sources of information are undoubtedly valuable, I firmly believe that students learn far more from lessons with teachers than from other sources. The personalized attention, guidance, and values that teachers provide are essential to students' academic and personal growth, and cannot be replicated by online resources or television programs.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;The advent of email and text messaging has undoubtedly revolutionized the way people communicate, offering unprecedented convenience and speed. However, this transformation has also sparked concerns about the impact on the status of written language. While some argue that these technologies are eroding the art of written communication, others contend that they are merely evolving the way we express ourselves.On one hand, the introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. The brevity and informality of these digital platforms have led to the proliferation of abbreviations, acronyms, and colloquialisms, which may undermine the traditional norms of written language. Moreover, the decreasing attention span and emphasis on instantaneity may result in a lack of depth and coherence in digital communication. Some people believe that these factors may be contributing to a decline in the position of written language, as the nuances and complexities of written expression are sacrificed for the sake of expediency.However, it is crucial to recognize that educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths, should pay more attention to this matter. Rather than simply lamenting the decline of written language, they should harness the potential of email and text messaging to promote literacy and effective communication skills. By incorporating digital communication into educational curricula and encouraging thoughtful, reflective writing practices, we can ensure that the benefits of technology are leveraged to enhance, rather than erode, the art of written language.Ultimately, the impact of email and text messaging on written language is not a zero-sum game, where the rise of one necessarily entails the fall of the other. Rather, it is a dynamic interplay, where the evolution of communication technologies presents both challenges and opportunities. By acknowledging and addressing these concerns, we can harness the transformative power of email and text messaging to augment, rather than threaten, the status of written language.
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";The debate about using animals for human benefit has sparked intense discussion among various stakeholders. While some people consider it acceptable to utilize animals for human purposes, others strongly oppose this practice, labeling it as cruel and inhumane. In my opinion, I believe that using animals for human benefit, specifically in the context of scientific research, is a necessary evil.On one hand, increasing numbers of animal experiments are being conducted, particularly in the development of new medicines and food products. These experiments are crucial in ensuring the safety and efficacy of these products before they are released to the market. For instance, testing new medicines on animals helps to identify potential side effects and toxicities, thereby safeguarding human health.On the other hand, some opponents argue that animal experimentation is cruel and inhumane, causing unnecessary suffering and harm to animals and disrupting the natural balance. However, I believe that no sensible person can deny the importance of testing new products on animals before they are released for human consumption.It would be dramatically cruel to humanity if the latest foods or medicines were allowed to be sold without rigorous testing on animals first. The potential consequences of releasing untested products would be catastrophic, leading to widespread harm and even death. By testing on animals, we can identify potential risks and mitigate them, ultimately protecting human life and well-being.In conclusion, while animal experimentation may seem cruel, I firmly believe that it is a necessary step in ensuring the safety and efficacy of new products. By acknowledging the importance of animal testing, we can strike a balance between human benefit and animal welfare, ultimately promoting a safer and healthier world for all.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;The advent of television has brought about a significant change in the way people spend their leisure time. While it has its benefits, such as providing entertainment and information, the statement that television has destroyed communication among friends and family holds some truth. I agree with this statement, and here are some specific reasons and examples that support my opinion.Firstly, most people do not have a plan or schedule for watching television, which often leads to excessive viewing. This excessive viewing can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, where individuals spend more time in front of the screen and less time interacting with friends and family. For instance, a person may spend hours watching their favorite show, completely absorbed in the story, and forget to call or visit their loved ones. In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is a really time-consuming task that can disrupt social connections.Secondly, watching television programs makes us lazy. Instead of engaging in physical activities or socializing, people tend to spend their free time watching TV. This laziness can lead to a lack of interest in interacting with others, as people become more comfortable with solitary activities. For example, a person may prefer watching TV to attending a family gathering or a friend's birthday party.Furthermore, some television programs advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activities, which can have a corrupting influence on viewers. These programs can promote a culture of violence and aggression, which can lead to a decline in social cohesion and communication. For instance, a show that glorifies crime and violence can lead to a desensitization of these issues, making it more difficult for individuals to empathize with others.In conclusion, while television has its benefits, I believe that it has destroyed communication among friends and family to some extent. The lack of a plan or schedule for watching television, the laziness it promotes, and the negative influence of some programs all contribute to this decline in communication. It is essential for individuals to be aware of these effects and make a conscious effort to balance their television viewing with social interactions.
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. Women have proven themselves in every field, whether it is indoor or outdoor. They have shown their skills in the subjects like science, technology, engineering, and mathematics where previously men were dominant. Despite their skills and abilities, women are still under-represented in many male-dominated fields. This under-representation has to be taken care of by the universities. They should take the initiative to encourage more female students in the male-dominated fields. This can be done by designing courses that appeal to both the genders. The university should also provide a conducive environment to the female students so that they can compete with their male counterparts. In the current scenario, the job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the needs of employers. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the universities to design their courses in a way that the needs of both the genders are taken care of. Universities should also focus on providing equal job opportunities to both male and female students. This will not only improve the overall quality of education but also help in the development of the society.In conclusion, universities should take the initiative to accept equal numbers of students of both the genders in every subject. By providing equal opportunities to both the genders, universities can help in the overall development of society.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;The decision of whether young adults should strive for independence from their parents as soon as possible or prefer to live with their families for a longer period is a highly debated topic. While some may argue that gaining independence is essential for personal growth, others believe that living with family can provide a more stable and secure environment.On one hand, many young adults are eager to leave their parents' houses as soon as possible to experience the thrill of having no limits and being independent. They want to make their own decisions, have their own space, and enjoy the freedom that comes with living on their own. However, in their pursuit of independence, these young adults often overlook the challenges that come with living away from home. They will have to manage their finances, cook their own meals, and deal with the stress of living on their own, which can be overwhelming and difficult to cope with.On the other hand, living with family can provide numerous benefits for young adults. By living with their parents, they can save a significant amount of money on rent and living expenses. They will not have to worry about financial problems or the stress of finding a compatible roommate. Additionally, living with family can provide a sense of security and stability, allowing young adults to focus on their education, career, and personal development.In conclusion, while independence is an important aspect of personal growth, I believe that living with family for a longer period can be more beneficial for young adults. It provides a stable and secure environment, allows them to save money, and reduces the stress of living on their own. Ultimately, it is essential for young adults to weigh the pros and cons of each option and make an informed decision that suits their individual needs and circumstances.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;The issue of environmental cleanup has sparked a debate between those who believe the government should take responsibility and those who think companies and private individuals should bear the burden. In my opinion, while the government plays a crucial role in setting regulations, more responsibilities should be placed on private individuals and companies, particularly when it comes to air pollution.Air pollution is a pressing concern that affects the environment in numerous ways. The release of pollutants into the atmosphere contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer, exacerbating global heating. This, in turn, has devastating consequences, including more frequent natural disasters, rising sea levels, and unpredictable weather patterns. Given the severity of this issue, it is essential that we hold private individuals and companies accountable for their role in perpetuating air pollution.One effective way to do this is by implementing a system where individuals and companies pay to clean up air pollution. This could take the form of a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system, where companies are required to purchase permits for their emissions. This would provide a financial incentive for individuals and businesses to reduce their reliance on polluting activities and invest in cleaner alternatives.On the other hand, governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and businesses. This could involve banning the sale of fossil fuels, implementing strict emissions standards for vehicles, and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. By setting these regulations, governments can create an environment that encourages sustainable practices and discourages polluting activities.In conclusion, while governments play a vital role in setting regulations, private individuals and companies should take more responsibility for cleaning up the environment, particularly when it comes to air pollution. By implementing a system of payment for pollution and restricting the use of polluting products, we can work towards a more sustainable future and mitigate the devastating effects of air pollution.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;High sales of a product are often attributed to various factors, with advertising strategies being one of the most significant contributors. To a certain extent, I agree that good advertising strategies play a crucial role in driving sales, but I also believe that it is not the sole determining factor.On one hand, advertising is indeed an effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product. Through various media channels, advertising can create awareness, build brand recognition, and shape consumer perceptions. Well-crafted advertisements can captivate audiences, generate interest, and ultimately drive sales. Moreover, advertising allows companies to differentiate their products from competitors, making them more appealing to potential customers.On the other hand, advertising is not sufficient in itself. A product must also satisfy the needs of consumers to achieve high sales. No matter how effective an advertising campaign may be, if the product does not meet consumer demands or expectations, sales will ultimately suffer. Consumers are increasingly savvy and will not be swayed by advertising alone. They require a product that delivers value, quality, and functionality.In conclusion, advertising is a reflection of a product's overall appeal and value proposition. While good advertising strategies can undoubtedly contribute to high sales, they are not a guarantee of success. Companies must also focus on developing products that meet consumer needs and expectations. Effective advertising can amplify the appeal of a well-designed product, but it cannot compensate for a product's shortcomings. Ultimately, the interplay between advertising and product quality is crucial in driving sales and achieving business success.
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";The debate about whether a high percentage of young people attending university is beneficial to a country has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While some believe that it will lead to numerous benefits, others argue that it will only result in unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.Those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons to support their claim. Firstly, they argue that the job market is not able to absorb the large number of graduates, leading to a surplus of skilled workers who cannot find employment. This is particularly true in countries where the economy is not growing rapidly enough to create new job opportunities. Secondly, they claim that the cost of university education is prohibitively expensive, leading to a significant burden on students and their families. Finally, they argue that many skills can be acquired through vocational training and apprenticeships, which are often more effective and less costly than a university degree.On the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge that is essential for a country's development. They argue that universities foster critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, which are invaluable in many areas of life. Furthermore, they claim that university education is essential for the development of a country's research and innovation capabilities, which are crucial for economic growth and competitiveness.In my opinion, while both views have valid points, the benefits of university education far outweigh the drawbacks. University education is essential for the development of a country's human capital, and it provides individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in an increasingly complex and competitive world. However, it is also important to note that vocational training and apprenticeships should also be encouraged, as they provide an alternative path for those who do not want to pursue a university degree. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines university education with vocational training is likely to be the most beneficial for a country's development.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;"The widespread use of mobile phones has revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and navigate our daily lives. However, this increased popularity has also brought about a multitude of problems that affect various aspects of our society. In this essay, I will analyze the social, medical, and technical problems associated with mobile phone use, and argue that these issues do indeed outweigh the benefits.Social problems are one of the most noticeable consequences of mobile phone use. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries, and hospitals, appears to be very impolite and offensive. This behavior not only disrupts the peace and quiet of these spaces but also shows a lack of consideration for others. Furthermore, the use of mobile phones has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication skills, as people increasingly rely on texting and social media to interact with others. Some students even utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tool in examinations, undermining the integrity of the educational system.Medical problems are another significant concern. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified mobile phone use as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans,"" highlighting the potential health risks associated with prolonged exposure to mobile phone radiation. Additionally, the constant need to check and respond to notifications can lead to increased stress levels, decreased attention span, and a decline in mental health.Technical problems also plague mobile phone users. The rapid obsolescence of mobile phone technology means that devices become outdated quickly, contributing to electronic waste and environmental degradation. Moreover, the reliance on mobile phones has also created security risks, as users are vulnerable to hacking, identity theft, and other forms of cybercrime.In conclusion, while mobile phones have undoubtedly brought about a lot of convenience, the problems associated with their use cannot be ignored. The social, medical, and technical issues highlighted in this essay demonstrate that the drawbacks of mobile phone use do indeed outweigh the benefits. As mobile phone use continues to evolve, it is essential that we address these problems and strive for a more responsible and sustainable approach to mobile phone use."
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;The question of whether using computers daily has more negative than positive effects on children is a highly debated topic among parents and experts. While some people believe that computers are beneficial for children and should be used daily, others hold a different view. In my opinion, I agree that excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on children's physical and social development.On the one hand, some people argue that computers are essential tools for learning and can provide children with a wealth of educational resources. They claim that computers can enhance children's cognitive skills, such as problem-solving and critical thinking. However, I firmly believe that the negative effects of constant computer use far outweigh the benefits.One of the most significant negative effects of computer use on children is the impact on their eyesight. Staring at a screen for extended periods can cause eye strain, dry eyes, and even myopia (nearsightedness). Children who use computers daily are more likely to experience these problems, which can lead to long-term vision damage.Another concern is the effect of computer use on children's social skills. Spending too much time playing games on the computer can lead to a lack of face-to-face communication and social interaction. Children who spend most of their time playing games online may struggle to communicate effectively with their peers, leading to social isolation and decreased empathy.In conclusion, while some people believe that computers are beneficial for children, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, using computers constantly has a profoundly negative impact on children's physical and social development. Parents and caregivers should be aware of these risks and set limits on their children's computer use to ensure a healthy balance between technology and other aspects of life.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;The construction of a large factory near our community has sparked intense debate regarding its impact on our daily lives. While some residents express concern over the potential drawbacks, I firmly believe that the advantages of this new influence will outweigh its disadvantages, provided that we take proactive measures to address the environmental problems associated with factories.On the one hand, the arrival of a large factory is expected to bring numerous benefits to our community. Firstly, it will undoubtedly stimulate local economic growth by attracting new investments, creating job opportunities, and increasing the overall purchasing power of residents. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment rates are likely to soar, reducing unemployment and underemployment rates in the process. Furthermore, the presence of a large factory can elevate the status of our community, making it a more attractive location for businesses and individuals alike.On the other hand, it is undeniable that the operation of a factory can lead to environmental concerns, such as air and water pollution. However, if we tackle these issues proactively, the negative impact can be mitigated. Implementing stringent regulations, investing in pollution-reducing technologies, and promoting eco-friendly practices can minimize the environmental damage.Moreover, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society, as industrialization is a natural step in a country's economic growth. Therefore, it is crucial that we learn to coexist with factories and find ways to maximize their benefits while minimizing their drawbacks.In conclusion, the construction of a large factory near our community can be a blessing in disguise. While there are valid concerns regarding its environmental impact, I firmly believe that the advantages of this new influence will outweigh its disadvantages. By addressing the environmental problems proactively, we can harness the benefits of industrialization and create a prosperous future for our community.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;The rise of prepared and processed food has undoubtedly made meal preparation easier and more convenient. With the increasing demand for quick and effortless meals, the market has responded with a vast array of pre-packaged and ready-to-eat options. However, this trend has also raised concerns about the negative consequences of relying heavily on prepared food.One of the primary concerns is the use of artificial ingredients in many prepared foods. Preservatives, flavor enhancers, and coloring agents are commonly used to extend shelf life and improve appearance, but these additives can have detrimental effects on our health. Consuming high amounts of processed foods has been linked to various health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, the emphasis on convenience often leads to a disregard for the nutritional value of food, with many prepared meals lacking essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber.Another issue with the prevalence of prepared food is its impact on our eating habits. The convenience of pre-packaged meals can lead to a lack of mindfulness when it comes to food, causing us to overlook the importance of a balanced diet and the joy of cooking and sharing meals. Moreover, the more we rely on prepared food, the more we risk losing traditional cooking skills and the cultural heritage associated with food preparation.In addition, the over-reliance on prepared food can result in a decline in cooking skills, as people are no longer required to prepare meals from scratch. This not only leads to a loss of culinary knowledge but also limits our ability to adapt to changing circumstances, such as food shortages or special dietary needs. By relying on prepared food, we are also denying ourselves the satisfaction and creativity that comes with cooking and preparing meals for ourselves and our loved ones.In conclusion, while prepared food may offer convenience and ease, it is essential to acknowledge the potential negative consequences of relying too heavily on these options.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;The notion that the best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid is a contentious issue. While some argue that financial assistance is the most effective way to alleviate poverty and stimulate growth, others contend that it is not a panacea for the complex problems faced by developing countries.On the one hand, there are numerous examples of developed countries and organizations providing financial assistance to impoverished nations. For instance, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the World Bank have been instrumental in providing financial aid to developing countries. This assistance is often directed towards education, a sector that is critical for the development of human capital. By investing in education, developing countries can build a skilled workforce, increase productivity, and ultimately, accelerate economic growth. The necessity of developing education in these countries is evident, and financial aid from developed countries and organizations can play a vital role in achieving this objective.However, it is also acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. Financial aid often comes with strings attached, and recipient countries may be required to adopt certain policies or reforms that may not be in their best interests. Moreover, financial aid can create dependency, rather than promoting self-sufficiency and sustainability. Additionally, financial aid may not address the underlying structural issues that contribute to poverty and underdevelopment in these countries.In conclusion, while financial aid can be an important tool for assisting developing countries, it is not the only solution. A more comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying causes of poverty and underdevelopment, and promotes sustainable development, is necessary. Developed countries and organizations should provide financial aid as part of a broader package of support that includes technical assistance, capacity building, and policy support. Ultimately, the objective of supporters should be to empower developing countries to take ownership of their development, rather than perpetuating dependency on financial aid.
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;I disagree with the notion that society should ban all forms of advertising. While it is true that some forms of advertising can be detrimental to society, particularly when they promote harmful products such as alcohol and cigarettes, a complete ban on advertising would be an overreaching solution.Advertising is a crucial means of promoting goods and services, allowing companies and individuals to reach their target audience and showcase their offerings. Without advertising, many businesses would struggle to survive, as they rely heavily on this form of promotion to stay afloat. Moreover, governments also benefit from advertising, as they use it to raise awareness about important issues, promote public services, and encourage civic engagement.It is true that some types of advertising can have a negative impact on society, particularly on children. Advertising for alcohol, cigarettes, and products with adult content can be particularly damaging, as they can promote unhealthy habits and behaviors among young people. Therefore, it is reasonable to restrict or ban advertising for these products, especially in media that is targeted towards children.However, this does not mean that all advertising is inherently bad. In fact, many advertisements promote positive values and behaviors, such as environmental sustainability and social responsibility. Moreover, advertising can also be a valuable source of information, helping consumers make informed decisions about the products and services they use.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the impact of advertising on society, a complete ban would be an overreaction. Instead, a more nuanced approach would be to regulate advertising, restricting or banning ads that promote harmful products or behaviors, while allowing businesses and governments to continue using advertising as a means of promoting their goods and services. This would strike a balance between protecting society from the negative effects of advertising, while still allowing it to serve its valuable purposes.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;In today's society, the opportunities available to women have increased exponentially compared to the past. The debate surrounding the role of women, whether they should prioritize their careers or focus on household responsibilities, is a contentious one. In my opinion, women should have the freedom to choose their path, and I firmly believe that working outside the home is not only beneficial for them but also for their families and society as a whole.One of the primary advantages of women working is the financial stability it provides. With the eradication of employment discrimination based on gender, married women now have the right to take up jobs alongside men. This allows them to earn a steady income, which can significantly support their family life. By contributing financially, women can alleviate some of the economic pressures on their spouses, ensuring a more comfortable and secure life for their loved ones.Moreover, working outside the house offers numerous personal benefits for married women. It provides opportunities for them to interact with the outer world, broadening their perspectives and experiences. This, in turn, strengthens their character and enables them to demonstrate their capabilities, fostering a sense of independence and self-worth. Furthermore, working mothers set a valuable example for their children, showcasing the importance of hard work, dedication, and pursuing one's passions. This can have a profound impact on the next generation, encouraging them to be ambitious, resilient, and open-minded.In conclusion, I firmly believe that women should have the option to work and pursue their careers. Not only does it provide financial stability and personal growth, but it also sets a positive example for future generations. As society continues to evolve, it is essential that we recognize the value of women's contributions, both within the home and in the workforce, and strive to create an environment that supports and empowers them to make their choices freely.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";The provision of education is a fundamental responsibility of any government, and it is widely acknowledged that primary and secondary education should be provided free of charge to all citizens. However, the question of whether university education should also be funded by the government is a topic of ongoing debate. In my opinion, while the government has a duty to provide primary and secondary education, university education is a different matter, and students or their parents should be responsible for paying the fees.On the one hand, providing free university education is a significant financial burden on the government. The costs of funding universities, including faculty salaries, infrastructure, and resources, are substantial, and it is unfair to expect taxpayers to foot the bill for the education of a select few. By having students or their parents pay for university fees, the government can redirect these funds to other important public services and priorities.On the other hand, there are valid concerns that requiring students or their parents to pay for university fees can create barriers to access for those from lower-income backgrounds. Many parents may not have the financial means to support their children's university education, and this can perpetuate inequality and limit social mobility. However, there are also arguments that universities should offer scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid to support students who cannot afford the fees.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that the government should focus on providing primary and secondary education, and university education should be funded by students or their parents. The government has a significant financial burden in providing education, and it is unfair to expect taxpayers to fund the education of a select few.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;The rapid growth of vehicles on British roads, from the first car in 1888 to the projected 29 million by the year 2000, has sparked intense debate on the need for alternative forms of transport and international laws to control car ownership and use. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use.A great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation in recent years. While some state that the automobile is the most convenient mode of transportation, others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages to support the notion that alternative forms of transport are a necessity.Firstly, the alarming rate of environmental pollution caused by vehicles on the road is a compelling reason to encourage alternative forms of transport. The emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants from vehicles has severe consequences on the environment, including climate change and air pollution. Alternative forms of transport, such as cycling, walking, and electric vehicles, offer a cleaner and more sustainable solution.Secondly, the increasing traffic congestion on British roads is another reason to promote alternative forms of transport. With 29 million vehicles projected to be on the road by the year 2000, traffic congestion will only worsen, leading to wasted time, increased fuel consumption, and decreased productivity. Alternative forms of transport, such as public transport and carpooling, can help alleviate traffic congestion and reduce travel times.Finally, the introduction of international laws to control car ownership and use is necessary to address the global issue of transportation. With the increasing globalization of trade and commerce, the need for a coordinated approach to transportation policy is crucial. International laws can help set standards for emissions, safety, and efficiency, promoting a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly transportation system.In conclusion, the rapid growth of vehicles on British roads necessitates the encouragement of alternative forms of transport and the introduction of international laws to control car ownership and use. The environmental, economic, and social benefits of alternative forms of transport, combined with the need for a coordinated approach to transportation policy, make a compelling case for a shift away from car-dominated transportation systems.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";"The notion that rich countries should provide financial help to poor countries has been a topic of discussion for years. While some argue that this aid can create dependency and undermine local economies, I firmly believe that the benefits of providing financial assistance to poor countries far outweigh the drawbacks.First and foremost, many poor countries lack the basic resources and infrastructure necessary to stimulate economic growth. Providing financial aid can help bridge this gap, enabling these countries to invest in essential services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. This, in turn, can create a conducive environment for businesses to thrive, generating employment opportunities and increasing the overall standard of living. For instance, a country like Bangladesh has benefited significantly from foreign aid, which has helped to improve its healthcare and education systems, leading to a significant reduction in poverty rates.Secondly, aid campaigns often raise awareness about the plight of people living in poverty, encouraging consideration and empathy from the global community. This heightened awareness can lead to increased support and pressure on governments to take action, ultimately benefiting those in need. The ""Live Aid"" campaign in the 1980s, for example, brought attention to the devastating famine in Ethiopia, prompting a massive global response and saving countless lives.Thirdly, many aid campaigns include practical benefits that go beyond mere financial assistance. These may involve skills training, capacity building, and technology transfer, all of which can have a lasting impact on a country's development. For example, the ""One Laptop per Child"" initiative has provided millions of children in poor countries with access to education and digital skills, bridging the technology gap and opening doors to new opportunities.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the potential drawbacks of providing financial aid to poor countries, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the costs. By providing essential resources, raising awareness, and offering practical support, rich countries can play a significant role in alleviating poverty and promoting sustainable development. It is our moral obligation to help those in need, and I strongly advocate for continued financial assistance to poor countries."
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";The impact of globalization on the world's economies has been a subject of intense debate in recent years. While some people believe that globalization has numerous benefits, others argue that its negative effects should not be overlooked. In my opinion, I agree that the negative side of globalization should not be forgotten.On the one hand, globalization has indeed had a positive impact on the world's economies. It has enabled the free flow of goods, services, and ideas across borders, leading to increased economic growth, job creation, and cultural exchange. Many countries have benefited from globalization by attracting foreign investment, improving their infrastructure, and increasing their competitiveness in the global market.On the other hand, some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to the ethnic and religious values of people in their country. The influx of foreign cultures and ideas can lead to cultural homogenization, where local customs and traditions are lost in favor of more dominant global cultures. For instance, the spread of Western culture and values has led to the erosion of traditional practices and beliefs in many non-Western societies. Furthermore, globalization has also been criticized for perpetuating inequality and exploitation, as multinational corporations take advantage of cheap labor and natural resources in developing countries.Others, however, believe that globalization contributes effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. They argue that globalization has facilitated the sharing of knowledge, ideas, and technologies, leading to advancements in fields such as medicine, education, and environmental sustainability. Moreover, globalization has also promoted understanding and cooperation among nations, fostering diplomacy and peaceful resolution of conflicts.In conclusion, while globalization has undoubtedly had a positive impact on the world's economies, its negative side should not be forgotten. It is crucial to recognize the potential risks and challenges associated with globalization, such as cultural homogenization and economic exploitation, and work towards mitigating them. By acknowledging both the benefits and drawbacks of globalization, we can strive towards a more equitable and sustainable globalized world.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The debate about whether children should be allowed to leave school early to find a job has sparked intense discussion among educators, policymakers, and the general public. While some people argue that students who are not interested in academics should be permitted to drop out and pursue employment, others believe that staying in school is essential for their future success. In my opinion, I concur with the latter view, emphasizing the importance of compulsory education.On one hand, many people believe that children should stay in school to acquire knowledge and prepare better for their future. Education is a vital aspect of a person's life, providing them with essential skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. By staying in school, students can explore various subjects, discover their passions, and develop a strong foundation for their future careers. Moreover, education is a key factor in breaking the cycle of poverty, as it enables individuals to secure better-paying jobs and improve their socio-economic status.On the other hand, others argue that students who are not interested in academics may disrupt the learning environment and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. They claim that these students would be better off gaining practical experience and skills in the workforce, rather than wasting their time in a classroom.However, I strongly disagree with this perspective. While it is true that some students may not be academically inclined, it is still essential for them to receive a basic education. Compulsory education ensures that students acquire fundamental skills in reading, writing, and mathematics, which are necessary for everyday life. Furthermore, education helps individuals develop important life skills, such as teamwork, communication, and time management, which are valuable in any profession.In conclusion, while some people may argue that students who are not interested in academics should be allowed to leave school early, I firmly believe that compulsory education is crucial for their future success. By staying in school, students can gain essential knowledge, skills, and values that will benefit them throughout their lives.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;The notion that the high sales of popular consumer goods are a reflection of the power of advertising rather than the real needs of society is a contentious issue. On one hand, it is undeniable that advertisements have the ability to influence consumers' purchasing decisions, often convincing them to buy products that they do not necessarily need. Some people believe that advertisements create a false sense of need, making people desire products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. For instance, commercials often portray idealized scenarios where products solve problems that may not exist in reality, leading consumers to believe that they need these products to improve their lives.On the other hand, despite the fact that advertisements can be misleading and exaggerated, it is also true that they play an important role economically. Advertisements introduce new products to the market, providing consumers with various choices and allowing them to make informed decisions about their purchases. Furthermore, advertisements often entertain and engage audiences, making them a valuable form of media consumption in their own right. They can be visually enjoyable, creative, and even artistic, providing a welcome break from the monotony of daily life.In conclusion, while it is true that advertisements have the power to shape consumer behavior and create artificial demand, it is also important to recognize their positive contributions to the economy and society. Ultimately, the impact of advertising on sales reflects a complex interplay between the power of advertising and the real needs of society.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;The ownership of guns has been a topic of heated debate in recent years, with some arguing that it is a fundamental right, while others believe that it should be limited. From my perspective, the latter argument holds more weight. A gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, and as such, it should be subject to strict controls, just like in most countries around the world.The statistics are alarming. The rise in accident rates, violent crime rates, and suicide rates are all directly linked to the availability of guns. When guns are easily accessible, the likelihood of accidents, crimes, and suicides increases exponentially. In the United States alone, there are over 39,000 gun-related deaths each year, with many more injuries and near-misses. These numbers are staggering and unacceptable.Furthermore, the concept of self-defense, often cited as a reason for owning guns, is a flawed argument. In reality, the likelihood of using a gun for self-defense is extremely low, while the likelihood of it being used in a crime or accident is much higher. Moreover, studies have shown that countries with strict gun control laws have significantly lower rates of gun-related violence.In light of these facts, it is sensible to enforce strict gun control measures. This would include background checks, waiting periods, and limits on the types of guns that can be owned. It would also involve education and awareness campaigns to highlight the dangers of gun ownership. By limiting the ownership of guns, we can reduce the number of accidents, crimes, and suicides, and create a safer society for everyone.In conclusion, the ownership of guns should be strictly limited. The evidence is clear: the easier it is to get a gun, the more likely it is to be used in a harmful way. By enforcing strict gun control measures, we can prevent unnecessary deaths and injuries, and create a more peaceful society.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;The statement that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way, is a notion that warrants careful consideration. While there are valid arguments to support this opinion, I partially agree with this viewpoint.On one hand, international sporting events like the World Cup do bring nations together, promoting camaraderie and unity among participants and spectators alike. The shared passion for sports can transcend national boundaries, creating a platform for people to engage in a collective experience. The excitement and euphoria generated by these events can momentarily shift focus away from conflicts and tensions, fostering an atmosphere of peace and mutual respect.Moreover, international sporting events provide an outlet for fans to express patriotic emotions in a safe and controlled environment. As Yang notes, besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. The sense of national pride and belonging that comes with cheering for one's country can be a powerful unifying force, allowing individuals to channel their emotions constructively.However, it is essential to acknowledge that the impact of international sporting events on easing tensions is limited. Deep-seated conflicts and tensions cannot be resolved solely through sports. In some instances, these events can even exacerbate existing tensions, particularly if they are imbued with nationalistic fervor or if the outcome is perceived as a reflection of national superiority.In conclusion, while international sporting events like the World Cup do play a role in easing international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions, their impact is not universal and should not be overstated. Nevertheless, these events remain an essential part of our shared human experience, offering a unique opportunity for nations to come together and celebrate their differences.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;The rapid advancement of technology has sparked a heated debate about its impact on the socioeconomic divide between the rich and the poor. While some people believe that technology is exacerbating the gap between the two, others argue that it has the opposite effect. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my opinion on the matter.On one hand, some people consider that the range of technology available to the public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. They argue that the benefits of technology are mostly accessible to those who are already wealthy, thereby widening the gap between them and those who are less fortunate. However, I find it hard to agree with this opinion for several reasons.Firstly, the progress of material technology has led to the sharp fall of prices of a great number of products. For instance, smartphones and computers, which were once luxury items, are now affordable to people across various income levels. This democratization of technology has enabled people from all walks of life to access information, connect with others, and explore opportunities that were previously unavailable to them.Secondly, technical developments have improved productivity, which helps people to escape from daily chores and invest more time and energy in living a more meaningful life. Automation, for example, has freed people from mundane tasks, allowing them to focus on creative pursuits and entrepreneurial ventures. This, in turn, has enabled people to improve their socioeconomic status and bridge the gap between the rich and the poor.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that technology has the opposite effect of increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. By making products more affordable and improving productivity, technology has empowered people to take control of their lives and create opportunities for themselves. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential that we ensure that its benefits are accessible to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic background.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;"As governments around the world continue to invest heavily in space exploration, the debate about the reasonableness of this investment rages on. While many people still consider space travel a frivolous waste of resources, I firmly believe that the benefits of space exploration far outweigh the costs.One of the primary arguments against space exploration is that it diverts funds from more pressing issues on Earth, such as poverty, hunger, and disease. However, I would counter that the discoveries and advancements made through space exploration have numerous spin-off benefits that improve our daily lives. For instance, the development of GPS technology, which relies on satellites orbiting the Earth, has revolutionized navigation and communication.Furthermore, space exploration has greatly expanded our understanding of our home planet. A picture of Planet Earth taken from outer space, known as the ""Blue Marble"" image, conclusively proved that our planet is round, dispelling the flat Earth theory once and for all. Moreover, by observing the Earth from space, scientists can gather valuable insights into the planet's atmosphere, climate, and natural resources. This knowledge is essential for predicting and mitigating the effects of climate change, natural disasters, and environmental degradation.Additionally, space exploration has the potential to drive innovation and inspire future generations. The technological advancements made possible by space travel can lead to breakthroughs in fields like medicine, energy, and transportation. Moreover, the sense of wonder and awe that comes from exploring the vastness of space can spark young minds to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).In conclusion, while some may view space exploration as a costly indulgence, I firmly believe that the investment is reasonable. The benefits of space travel, from improving our daily lives to expanding our knowledge of the Earth and inspiring future generations, make it a worthwhile endeavor. As we continue to venture into the unknown, we may uncover even more reasons to justify the investment in space exploration."
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. While taking on a part-time job as a teenager may seem daunting, I strongly believe that the benefits of having a job while still a student far outweigh the drawbacks.On one hand, having a job can have negative effects on a student's academic performance and social life. For instance, the added responsibility of a job can lead to increased stress levels, decreased free time, and potentially lower grades. However, I firmly believe that these disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages of having a job.One of the most significant benefits of having a job as a student is gaining practical experience. By getting involved in extra jobs, students can apply theoretical knowledge in real-world settings, develop valuable skills, and build their professional network. For example, a student studying business can work part-time in a retail store, learning about customer service, marketing, and finance. Similarly, a student studying nursing can work as a caregiver, gaining hands-on experience in patient care and medical procedures.Furthermore, having a job can also foster independence, responsibility, and time management skills. Students learn to balance their work and academic schedules, prioritize tasks, and make smart financial decisions. Additionally, earning their own money can boost their self-esteem and motivation, encouraging them to work harder and achieve their goals.In conclusion, while there may be some drawbacks to having a job as a student, I firmly believe that the benefits of gaining practical experience, independence, and responsibility far outweigh the disadvantages. As students navigate their academic and professional careers, having a job can provide invaluable lessons that can benefit them for years to come.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;The practice of sending students to institutions or organizations to undertake unpaid work has become increasingly common in recent years. While it may seem counterintuitive to send students to work without pay, this practice can be beneficial for both the students and the organizations involved. This essay will discuss the benefits of this practice for both parties.For students, participating in unpaid work placements can be incredibly valuable. It provides them with an opportunity to gain practical experience in their chosen field, which can be a significant advantage when applying for jobs after graduation. Unpaid work placements also allow students to develop important skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are highly valued by employers. Additionally, these placements can give students a realistic insight into what a particular career path entails, helping them to make informed decisions about their future.For organizations, taking on unpaid interns can also have numerous benefits. As mentioned, one of the most obvious advantages is the cost savings. Unpaid interns can assist with tasks and projects without incurring the expense of a full-time employee. Moreover, unpaid interns can bring fresh ideas and perspectives to an organization, which can be invaluable in driving innovation and creativity. Furthermore, hosting unpaid interns can also help organizations to identify and recruit talented individuals who may become valuable employees in the future.Another benefit for organizations is the opportunity to give back to the community by providing students with valuable work experience. This can enhance an organization's reputation and contribute to its corporate social responsibility. In addition, supervising and mentoring interns can also help employees to develop their own skills and experience.In conclusion, sending students to institutions or organizations to undertake unpaid work can be beneficial for both parties. Students gain valuable experience and skills, while organizations can save money, gain fresh perspectives, and identify talented individuals.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;The notion that paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and increase their productivity has been a topic of debate among managers and HR experts. While some argue that financial incentives are the primary driver of employee motivation, others contend that this is a simplistic view that overlooks the complexity of human motivation. In this essay, I will discuss the extent to which I agree or disagree with the statement.On the one hand, a raise or a promotion can undoubtedly boost morale in the workplace. Financial rewards can motivate employees to work harder and strive for excellence, as they feel that their efforts are being recognized and valued. Additionally, higher salaries can provide employees with a sense of financial security, reducing stress and anxiety that may hinder their productivity. Many organizations have successfully used financial incentives to motivate their employees, leading to increased productivity and job satisfaction.On the other hand, I disagree that paying more money is the only possible motivation for employees. Research has shown that non-financial incentives, such as recognition, autonomy, and opportunities for growth and development, can be equally effective in motivating employees. For instance, a sense of purpose and meaning in one's work can be a powerful motivator, driving employees to work harder and be more productive. Furthermore, a positive work-life balance, a supportive work environment, and opportunities for advancement can also motivate employees without necessarily requiring a pay raise.In conclusion, while paying more money can certainly motivate employees to work harder and increase their productivity, I disagree that it is the only possible motivation. A more nuanced approach to employee motivation is needed, one that takes into account the diverse needs and values of individual employees. By offering a range of incentives, both financial and non-financial, organizations can create a motivating work environment that fosters productivity, job satisfaction, and employee well-being.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;I completely agree that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions play a vital role in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.One of the primary ways in which large-scale sports games contribute to this goal is by distracting people from international disputes and focusing their attention on attractive contests. When nations compete on the football pitch, for example, people's energies are directed towards the game rather than towards conflict. This shift in focus can help to diffuse tensions between countries and provide a welcome respite from the pressures of international politics.Moreover, international sporting events provide people with an opportunity to express their national pride in a positive and safe way. Fans are able to display their national symbols, such as flags and jerseys, and cheer on their team with fellow supporters. This collective expression of national identity can be a powerful force in promoting unity and solidarity within a country, and can even help to foster greater understanding and respect between nations.By analyzing the role of sports events in promoting peace, it becomes clear that they can serve as an important link between nations. The Olympic Truce, for instance, is a tradition that dates back to ancient Greece, where all conflicts would cease during the Olympic Games. Similarly, the football World Cup has brought together fans from around the world, creating a shared sense of community and shared excitement. These events encourage people to put aside their differences and come together in a spirit of friendly competition.In conclusion, I firmly believe that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. By providing a platform for nations to compete in a spirit of friendly rivalry, these events promote unity, understanding, and peace between countries.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;I disagree with the statement that the major source of energy today is water. However, I completely agree with the opinion that governments should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. The world is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, which are the major source of energy globally, but they have devastating environmental impacts. The extensive amount of gases released by these energy sources contributes significantly to global warming, posing a significant threat to the planet.The continued use of non-renewable energy sources is unsustainable and has severe consequences for the environment. Many countries still rely heavily on these sources, despite the well-documented risks. In fact, some regions still generate electricity from water, despite water scarcity issues. This approach not only exacerbates global warming but also depletes water sources, affecting both human consumption and ecosystems.Promoting alternative energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, is crucial for mitigating climate change. Governments play a vital role in encouraging the transition to renewable energy. They can offer incentives for individuals and businesses to invest in alternative energy, implement policies that support the development of renewable energy infrastructure, and fund research into new sustainable energy technologies.In conclusion, while water is not the major source of energy today, the reliance on fossil fuels is a pressing concern that requires immediate attention. Governments must take proactive steps to promote alternative energy sources, ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;The issue of whether the government should provide direct financial aid to unemployed individuals has been a longstanding topic of debate. Unemployment is clearly a global problem, affecting not only developing countries but also developed nations. While some argue that it is the government's responsibility to provide financial assistance, I tend to disagree.In my opinion, it is primarily the responsibility of the individual, rather than the government, to take proactive steps towards re-employment. Providing direct financial aid may create a culture of dependency, where individuals rely on government support rather than taking initiative to improve their own circumstances. Furthermore, government resources are limited, and providing direct financial aid to all unemployed individuals may divert funds from other essential public services.Instead, governments can focus on creating an environment conducive to job creation and skill development. This can be achieved by implementing policies that promote entrepreneurship, vocational training, and education. By equipping individuals with the necessary skills and knowledge, they can increase their chances of finding employment and becoming self-sufficient. Additionally, governments can provide support in the form of job placement services, career counseling, and education assistance, which can be more effective in the long run.It is also worth noting that direct financial aid may not address the root causes of unemployment, such as lack of education, skills, or job opportunities. By addressing these underlying issues, governments can create a more sustainable solution to unemployment, rather than simply providing a temporary financial Band-Aid.In conclusion, while I understand the intention behind providing direct financial aid to unemployed individuals, I believe that it is primarily the responsibility of the individual to take proactive steps towards re-employment. Governments can play a supportive role by creating an environment conducive to job creation and skill development, rather than relying solely on direct financial aid.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;The role of a university has been a topic of debate for many years, with some arguing that the primary function of a university should be to provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace, while others believe that its true purpose is to grant access to knowledge for its own sake. In my opinion, I agree with the latter view that the main function of a university should be to provide access to knowledge, regardless of its utility in the job market.In its essence, a university is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. This fundamental principle suggests that it is not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to students. Instead, these should be made available when needed. By adopting this approach, universities can maintain their academic freedom and independence, unencumbered by the pressure to produce job-ready graduates.Furthermore, this perspective acknowledges that knowledge has inherent value, regardless of its practical applications. By prioritizing access to knowledge for its own sake, universities can foster a love of learning, critical thinking, and intellectual curiosity in their students. This, in turn, can lead to a more informed and engaged citizenry, better equipped to navigate the complexities of the modern world.In contrast, if universities were to prioritize vocational training above all else, they risk becoming mere extensions of the corporate world, churning out graduates who are skilled in specific areas, but lacking in broader intellectual and cultural perspectives. By staying true to their core mission of providing access to knowledge, universities can maintain their integrity and continue to play a vital role in shaping the minds and characters of future generations.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;I disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. While some critics argue that zoos do more harm than good, I believe that well-managed zoos play a crucial role in conservation, education, and research.One of the primary arguments against zoos is that they are more likely to be a killer than a protector of wild lives. However, I would argue that this is not necessarily true. Reputable zoos prioritize animal welfare and provide a safe haven for species that are threatened or endangered in the wild. In fact, many zoos are involved in breeding programs that help increase the population of endangered species, which can then be released back into their natural habitats.Another argument against zoos is that strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide adequate protection for animals in their natural habitats. While laws are essential in preventing poaching, they are not enough on their own to protect animals from other threats such as habitat destruction, climate change, and human-wildlife conflict. Zoos can provide a safe haven for animals that are affected by these threats, and can also play a crucial role in educating the public about the importance of conservation.Furthermore, zoos are involved in important research that helps us understand animal behavior, physiology, and psychology. This research can inform conservation efforts and help us develop effective strategies for protecting animals in the wild.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the role of zoos in protecting wild lives, I believe that well-managed zoos play a vital role in conservation, education, and research. By providing a safe haven for threatened species, supporting breeding programs, and educating the public about the importance of conservation, zoos can make a positive impact on animal welfare and conservation.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;The rise of distance-learning programs has revolutionized the way we approach education, offering students worldwide the flexibility to learn from anywhere. While some argue that online courses cannot replace the traditional college or university experience, I firmly believe that distance-learning has its own unique advantages and should be widely adopted by institutions of higher learning.One of the most significant benefits of distance-learning is the convenience it offers to students. With the ability to access course materials and attend virtual classes from anywhere, students can balance their academic pursuits with work, family, or other responsibilities. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for those living in remote areas or having limited access to quality educational institutions in their vicinity. Moreover, distance-learning programs allow students to learn at their own pace, which can lead to better retention rates and academic outcomes.Another advantage of distance-learning is the ability to reach a larger audience. With the presence of video conferencing tools, a teacher can teach a greater number of students simultaneously, transcending geographical boundaries. This not only increases the accessibility of education but also enables institutions to offer courses to a more diverse range of students, promoting cultural exchange and understanding.However, it is true that some aspects of the traditional college experience, such as face-to-face interactions and hands-on learning, may be compromised in an online setting. Nevertheless, I believe that the benefits of distance-learning far outweigh these limitations. By embracing online teaching methods, colleges and universities can expand their reach, improve student outcomes, and stay ahead of the curve in an increasingly digital world.In conclusion, while some may argue that distance-learning programs lack the quality of traditional college or university experiences, I firmly believe that they offer a unique set of advantages that make them an attractive option for students worldwide. With the continued development of technology and online learning platforms, I am confident that distance-learning will become an integral part of the educational landscape, offering students unparalleled flexibility, accessibility, and opportunities for growth.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";The advent of modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails, and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger has undoubtedly brought about significant changes to our lives in recent years. While some individuals have greatly benefited from these innovations, others have been left behind, sparking a heated debate on the overall impact of modern communication technology. In this essay, I will argue that while modern communication technology has its advantages, it is indeed true that not everyone has benefited from it, particularly the less privileged.On the one hand, modern communication technology has revolutionized the way we connect with each other. Mobile phones have enabled instant communication, while e-mails and internet chat programs have made it possible to stay in touch with people across the globe. This has been particularly beneficial for business professionals, students, and individuals who need to communicate with people from diverse geographical locations. Additionally, modern communication technology has also enabled access to a vast array of information, educational resources, and job opportunities.On the other hand, opponents of modern communication technology claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. This is a valid argument, as many people in developing countries and marginalized communities lack access to these technologies due to economic constraints. Furthermore, the digital divide has also resulted in the exclusion of certain groups, such as the elderly and those with limited technical expertise, from the benefits of modern communication technology. In some cases, the lack of access to these technologies has even exacerbated existing social and economic inequalities.In conclusion, while modern communication technology has undoubtedly brought about significant benefits, it is essential to acknowledge that not everyone has benefited from it. The digital divide and unequal access to these technologies have resulted in the exclusion of certain groups, highlighting the need for initiatives that aim to bridge this gap and ensure that everyone has access to the benefits of modern communication technology.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;The debate over whether musical lessons should be made mandatory in high school education has sparked intense discussion among educators and students alike. While some argue that music is an essential part of a well-rounded education, others claim that it is a waste of time for students who have other priorities. In my opinion, I believe that musical lessons should not be mandatory in high school education.Many people claim that music should be taught as a main subject in high school, just like mathematics, science, and language. They argue that music has numerous benefits, such as improving cognitive skills, boosting creativity, and enhancing teamwork. However, I disagree with this notion. In high school, students are at a critical stage of their academic journey, where they need to focus on developing their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects. For instance, students who aspire to become engineers, doctors, or lawyers need to concentrate on subjects like physics, biology, and mathematics, respectively.While music can be a valuable extracurricular activity, making it a mandatory subject can be counterproductive. Not all students may have a passion for music, and forcing them to take music lessons can lead to disengagement and a waste of time. Moreover, with the increasing academic pressure and competition in high schools, students need to prioritize their core subjects to achieve good grades and secure a good future. Making music optional, on the other hand, allows students who are interested in music to pursue it without compromising their academic performance.In conclusion, while music has its benefits, I believe that it should not be made mandatory in high school education. Students should be allowed to focus on developing their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, and music should be offered as an optional subject for those who are interested. This approach will enable students to strike a balance between their academic and extracurricular pursuits, ultimately leading to a more productive and successful educational experience.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;The statement that universities should allocate the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries is a debatable topic. Both libraries and sports activities play important roles in a university's success, as they contribute to the overall development of students and the institution's reputation. However, in my opinion, universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.Firstly, a library is a vital and strategic part of a university. It serves as the central hub for academic research and learning, providing students with access to vast resources, including books, journals, and digital materials. A well-equipped library is essential for students to excel in their studies, as it provides them with the necessary tools to conduct research, complete assignments, and prepare for exams. In contrast, while sports activities are important for students' physical and mental well-being, they do not have a direct impact on academic performance.Secondly, libraries usually do not have any income streams to rely on, unlike sports activities, which can generate revenue through ticket sales, sponsorships, and advertising. Libraries rely solely on university funding to operate and maintain their resources. Allocating a significant portion of the budget to libraries is crucial to ensure that they can continue to provide students with the necessary resources to succeed.Furthermore, investing in libraries has long-term benefits, as it contributes to the university's reputation and attracts prospective students. A well-equipped library is often a key factor in students' decision-making process when choosing a university. On the other hand, while sports activities are important for student life, they are not as critical to a university's core function as libraries are.In conclusion, while both libraries and sports activities are important for universities, I strongly believe that universities should prioritize investing in their libraries. The vital role that libraries play in supporting academic research and learning, combined with their reliance on university funding, makes them a more critical component of a university's success.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";"The spread of English as a global language has sparked intense debate regarding its impact on lesser-known languages. On one hand, some people claim that the prevalence of English brings a great number of benefits for individuals and societies alike. English has become the language of international communication, commerce, and education, offering countless opportunities for people to connect with others across the globe, access knowledge, and advance their careers. As a result, many individuals and countries have embraced English as a second language, reaping its economic and social rewards.However, opponents of the English language's dominant status argue that it has come at the cost of cultural diversity and the extinction of many lesser-used languages. With English being widely taught and used, many indigenous languages are no longer being passed down to younger generations, leading to a loss of linguistic heritage and cultural identity. This is particularly concerning in Asian countries, where languages such as Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean have vastly different linguistic systems that are not easily translatable into English.In these countries, English, no matter how sophisticated, fails to capture the nuances and complexities of everyday life. For instance, the concept of ""guanxi"" in Chinese, which refers to the complex web of relationships and social networks, cannot be directly translated into English, losing its cultural significance. Similarly, the Japanese concept of ""ikigai,"" which refers to finding purpose and meaning in life, is often lost in translation. This highlights the importance of preserving and promoting local languages, not only as a means of communication but also as a way to maintain cultural diversity and identity. In conclusion, while English offers many benefits, its dominance has undoubtedly contributed to the decline of lesser-known languages, and it is essential to strike a balance between promoting English and preserving linguistic diversity."
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The use of animals for human benefit has been a long-standing debate, with some arguing that it is acceptable to exploit animals for our own needs, while others believe that animals have inherent rights that should be protected. On one hand, many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, such as for food, clothing, and entertainment. For instance, many farmers rely on animals for their livelihood, and some owners keep animals as pets or use them for transportation. However, this utilization of animals often raises concerns that they are being misused and exploited beyond their limits.Many farmers and owners prioritize their own interests over the welfare of animals, leading to inhumane treatment and neglect. Animals are often subjected to cruel conditions, such as overcrowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate nutrition. This exploitation is not only unethical but also unsustainable, as it can lead to animal suffering, disease, and even extinction. Moreover, the use of animals for human benefit can also perpetuate a culture of dominance and disrespect towards non-human species.On the other hand, many argue that humans should behave as guardians to animals rather than as their lord or master. This perspective recognizes that animals have inherent rights and interests that should be respected and protected. As guardians, humans have a responsibility to ensure the welfare and well-being of animals, providing them with adequate care, shelter, and protection from harm. This approach not only promotes animal welfare but also fosters a culture of compassion, empathy, and respect towards non-human species.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";The advent of modern technology has revolutionized the way people experience exhibitions, with many museums and art galleries offering virtual tours and online exhibitions. Some people believe that this trend will eventually lead to the demise of physical museums and art galleries. However, I strongly disagree with this notion.While modern technology has undoubtedly made it possible for people to view exhibitions from the comfort of their own homes, the importance of museums and art galleries in terms of education and culture cannot be overstated. These institutions provide a unique and immersive experience that goes beyond mere visual appreciation. They offer a chance to engage with the exhibits in a tactile and sensory way, to learn from experts and to interact with other visitors. For instance, a student can gain a deeper understanding of a historical artifact by seeing it in person, reading about its context and significance, and discussing it with a curator or fellow visitor.Furthermore, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed through images and videos alone. The nuances of texture, color, and scale are often lost in digital representations, and the emotional impact of encountering a masterpiece or relic in person is impossible to replicate online. The Mona Lisa, for example, is a painting that has been reproduced and parodied countless times, but seeing the original in the Louvre Museum is a profoundly different experience from viewing a digital image. The grandeur of the painting, the delicate smile, and the intricate details are all more pronounced in person, and the experience is enriched by the knowledge that one is seeing a piece of history.In conclusion, while modern technology has certainly increased access to exhibitions, it is unlikely to replace the physical experience of visiting a museum or art gallery. These institutions continue to play a vital role in educating and culturally enriching society, and their importance will endure long after the novelty of virtual exhibitions has worn off.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;The question of whether teenagers should learn all school subjects or focus on the subjects they are best at or interested in has sparked a debate among educators and parents. On one hand, some people believe that students should learn all subjects, as it provides a well-rounded education and prepares them for an uncertain future. This approach ensures that students have a broad knowledge base, which can be beneficial in many areas of life. Additionally, learning a wide range of subjects can help students discover their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their interests and passions.On the other hand, others argue that students should focus on the subjects they excel in or enjoy. This approach can lead to a deeper understanding and mastery of the subject matter, as students are more motivated to learn and engage with the material. Focusing on one subject can also save time and energy, allowing students to specialize and develop expertise in a particular area. Moreover, studying only one subject can be more effective, as students can concentrate their efforts and achieve better results.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that a balanced approach is the most effective. Learning all subjects provides a broad foundation, while focusing on areas of interest and strength can lead to depth and mastery. Ultimately, the key is to find a balance between breadth and depth, allowing students to develop a well-rounded education while also pursuing their passions and interests.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;The increasing dominance of English as a global language has sparked concerns about the decline of lesser-known languages. While some argue that this trend leads to cultural homogenization and language extinction, I firmly believe that the advantages of widespread English usage outweigh the disadvantages.On the one hand, the proliferation of English can contribute to the decline of minority languages. As English becomes the primary language for international communication, there may be less incentive for people to learn and maintain their native languages. This can lead to a loss of cultural heritage and diversity. However, I would argue that the benefits of English as a global language far outweigh these negative effects.In my country, for example, English is a required course from elementary school, and this has opened up a world of opportunities for young people. Studying abroad has become increasingly popular among youngsters, allowing them to experience different cultures and gain a global perspective. This, in turn, has fostered greater understanding and cooperation between nations. Moreover, researchers, particularly those in high-tech fields, have access to a vast array of references and resources, enabling them to stay at the forefront of their fields and contribute to groundbreaking discoveries.In conclusion, while the spread of English may have some negative effects on lesser-known languages, I am convinced that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. By facilitating international communication, education, and research, English has become a vital tool for individuals and nations to succeed in an increasingly interconnected world. As such, I believe that the prevalent usage of English is a positive development that will continue to bring numerous advantages to people and countries around the globe.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";The debate on whether creative artists should be given the freedom to express their ideas without government restrictions has been ongoing. In my opinion, I agree to a certain extent that creative artists should be given the freedom to express their ideas, but with some caveats.Firstly, creativity originates in a free mind, and hence, it is essential to provide artists with the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions. Restrictions can stifle creativity and hinder the artistic process. When artists are allowed to express themselves freely, they can push boundaries, challenge societal norms, and create innovative and thought-provoking works. This freedom is essential for artistic growth and development.However, I also believe that artists, like the media, should be aware of the impact of their work on the audience. They should know not to hurt the sentiments of the people, and avoid creating works that promote hate, violence, or discrimination. Artists have a responsibility to be sensitive to the diverse perspectives and experiences of their audience.Moreover, while freedom of expression is essential, it is equally important to ensure that artists do not use their freedom to incite violence, defame individuals, or promote obscenity. Governments can play a role in setting boundaries and guidelines that prevent the misuse of artistic freedom, while still allowing artists to express themselves creatively.In conclusion, while I agree that creative artists should be given the freedom to express their ideas, I also believe that this freedom should be accompanied by a sense of responsibility and awareness of the impact of their work on others. By striking a balance between freedom and responsibility, we can promote artistic growth and creativity while ensuring that art is used as a positive force in society.
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;"The age-old debate surrounding the upbringing of children has sparked intense discussion among parents, educators, and experts. While some advocate for fostering a sense of competition in children, others believe that teaching them to cooperate is more beneficial. In this essay, we will delve into both perspectives and explore my stance on this matter.On one hand, encouraging competition in children can drive them to strive for excellence, push boundaries, and achieve their full potential. The history of science and technology is replete with examples of competition leading to groundbreaking discoveries and innovations. The rivalry between inventors and scientists has propelled human progress, and it is undeniable that competition has played a significant role in shaping our modern world.On the other hand, an overemphasis on competition can lead to a ""your loss, my gain"" mentality, where individuals prioritize their success over others' well-being. This approach can never be fruitful in the long run, as it fosters a cutthroat environment that neglects the value of collaboration and mutual support. In contrast, teaching children to cooperate can help them develop essential life skills, such as communication, empathy, and problem-solving.However, I firmly believe that co-operation and competition are two sides of the same coin, inextricably linked and inseparable. In reality, competition and cooperation are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary aspects of human nature. By acknowledging this interdependence, we can create an environment that balances individual achievement with collective growth.In conclusion, rather than promoting one over the other, we should strive to create a balance between competition and cooperation. By doing so, we can raise a generation of individuals who are not only driven to succeed but also capable of working together towards a common goal. Ultimately, it is this delicate balance that will enable children to become more useful, well-rounded, and successful adults."
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";"The notion that capital punishment is essential to control violence in society has been a contentious issue for many years. While some argue that the death penalty serves as a deterrent to violent crimes, others contend that it has little impact on crime rates. In my opinion, I partially agree that capital punishment can contribute to securing our lives, but only to a limited extent.On one hand, crime is indeed always punishable, and retribution is a method used to counter criminal behavior. The concept of ""an eye for an eye"" is deeply ingrained in many cultures, and capital punishment can be seen as a means to achieve justice for heinous crimes. However, it is crucial to note that capital punishment is typically reserved for the ""rarest of the rare"" cases, where the crimes committed are exceptionally brutal and premeditated. In such instances, the death penalty may serve as a means to demonstrate the gravity of the crime and provide closure for the victims' families.Moreover, when a criminal mind is aware of the quantum of punishment, it can evoke fear and potentially deter them from committing violent crimes. The prospect of facing the ultimate penalty can have a psychological impact on individuals, making them think twice before engaging in violent behavior. Nonetheless, research has shown that the effectiveness of capital punishment as a deterrent is limited, and its impact on crime rates is often negligible.In conclusion, while capital punishment can play a role in controlling violence in society, its impact should not be exaggerated. The relationship between crime rates and capital punishment is complex, and other factors, such as socio-economic conditions, law enforcement, and rehabilitation programs, also play a significant role in shaping crime patterns."
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;In many countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between completing high school and beginning university studies, a practice known as a gap year. While this break is viewed as a valuable opportunity in some nations, others see it as a waste of time. In this essay, we will weigh the pros and cons of taking a gap year.On the plus side, taking a break from studies after 11 years of continuous education can be incredibly beneficial for young minds. Since most education systems require students to study without a break from the age of 5 to 16, a one-year relaxation can provide a quintessential change of pace. This pause can help students recharge, refocus, and gain a fresh perspective before diving into higher education.Moreover, using this time to work or travel can be highly advantageous in helping young people discover their field of interest. By exploring different careers, meeting new people, and experiencing new cultures, they can gain valuable insights into what they truly want to pursue in life. This, in turn, can lead to a more informed decision when choosing a university course, increasing their chances of success and job satisfaction.However, there are also potential downsides to consider. For one, some students may struggle to get back into the academic mindset after a year off, which can negatively impact their performance in university. Additionally, the time and money invested in a gap year could be spent on pursuing higher education directly, potentially leading to a faster entry into the workforce.In conclusion, while taking a gap year is not suitable for everyone, it can be a highly rewarding experience for young people. By weighing the advantages and disadvantages, students can make an informed decision that suits their individual needs and goals. Ultimately, whether viewed as a valuable opportunity or a waste of time, a gap year can be a life-changing experience that helps shape the minds and futures of young people.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";The advent of computers has revolutionized the world, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with one another. As a device that has given a whole new dimension to human life, computers have become an indispensable part of our daily lives. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years. They have made human life more easy, convenient, and lightning fast, with applications in various fields such as business, hospitals, crime detection, and aviation.In the future, computers are expected to play an even more significant role in shaping our lives. They will be used in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics. Computers will continue to transform the way we work, with automation and AI replacing manual labor in many industries. They will also play a crucial role in improving healthcare, with advanced medical imaging and diagnostic tools. Furthermore, computers will be used in space exploration, climate modeling, and other complex scientific research.However, everything has pros and cons. While computers have made our lives more convenient, they also pose significant risks. Over-reliance on computers can lead to loss of traditional skills, decreased human interaction, and increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks. Moreover, the environmental impact of computer manufacturing and disposal is a growing concern. Therefore, while we should continue to harness the benefits of computers, we should also be cautious of their limitations and potential risks.
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;The debate about whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has gained significant attention in recent years. While some argue that it is essential to maintain a balance between male and female students, others believe that it may not be practical or fair. In this essay, I will discuss the extent to which I agree with the statement.On the one hand, I strongly believe that universities should strive to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. This approach, also known as co-education, helps both genders to gel well with each other, fostering a sense of mutual respect and understanding. By studying together, male and female students can break down stereotypes and misconceptions about each other's abilities and capabilities. For instance, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender-biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. By promoting co-education, universities can play a significant role in dispelling such myths and empowering women to pursue careers in these fields.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that some subjects may have historically attracted more students of one gender than the other. For example, nursing and education programs have traditionally had more female students, while engineering and computer science programs have had more male students. Imposing quotas to achieve equal numbers of male and female students in every subject may not be practical or fair, as it may lead to less qualified students being accepted over more qualified ones.In conclusion, while I agree that universities should strive to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject, I also believe that it is essential to consider the practicalities and potential consequences of such an approach. By promoting co-education and providing support and resources to students of all genders, universities can help to break down gender barriers and promote a more equitable and inclusive learning environment.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;The debate about the relative benefits of traditional and modern games in developing children's skills has gained significant attention in recent years. In my opinion, traditional games are more useful than modern games in fostering children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. For this reason, I firmly believe that parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster communication skills. Unlike modern games that are played in isolation, traditional games require children to interact with their peers, promoting face-to-face communication, teamwork, and social bonding. For instance, games like tag, hide-and-seek, and capture the flag encourage children to negotiate, coordinate, and resolve conflicts, thereby enhancing their verbal and non-verbal communication skills. In contrast, modern games, often played on digital platforms, tend to isolate children and limit their opportunities for social interaction.Moreover, modern games are often developed by game companies with the primary purpose of generating profits, rather than promoting children's development. Many modern games are designed to be addictive, with the intention of keeping children engaged for extended periods, thereby maximizing revenue. In contrast, traditional games are often simple, yet effective, in promoting children's physical, cognitive, and emotional growth. They are also often free or low-cost, making them accessible to children from all socio-economic backgrounds.In conclusion, while modern games have their own set of benefits, I firmly believe that traditional games are more useful in developing children's skills. By promoting communication, teamwork, and social bonding, traditional games provide a unique set of benefits that are essential for children's growth and development. As such, parents and educators should prioritize traditional games and ensure that children have ample opportunities to engage in these activities.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The allocation of government funds is a perennial topic of debate. Some individuals argue that the government should prioritize spending on medical care and education over building theaters or sports stadiums. I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective.Providing education and medical care is more essential and should be prioritized by the government. These two sectors are fundamental to the well-being and development of a nation. Education empowers citizens with knowledge and skills, enabling them to contribute to the economy and society. Medical care, on the other hand, ensures that citizens have access to necessary healthcare, thereby maintaining a healthy and productive workforce. In contrast, theaters and sports stadiums, while providing entertainment and leisure activities, are secondary to the basic needs of education and healthcare.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money into building theaters or sports stadiums can be seen as unfair to those who cannot use them. Not everyone may have the means or interest to attend events at these facilities, yet they still contribute to the tax revenue that funds these projects. This raises questions about the equitable distribution of public funds. In contrast, investing in education and medical care benefits the broader population, as these services are essential to the daily lives of citizens.In conclusion, I strongly agree that the government should allocate more funds to medical care and education rather than building theaters or sports stadiums. These two sectors are vital to the development and well-being of a nation, and investing in them is a more equitable use of taxpayers' money.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;The notion that developing a country's technology inevitably leads to the decline of traditional skills and ways of life has sparked intense debate. While some people worry that modern technological advancements pose a threat to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles, I firmly believe that technology plays a crucial role in promoting these very skills.On one hand, it is true that the rapid pace of technological progress can sometimes lead to the erosion of traditional practices. The ease and convenience offered by modern technology can make traditional skills seem obsolete, causing them to fade away. However, I would argue that this is a narrow-minded view, as it fails to acknowledge the numerous ways in which technology can actually aid in the preservation of traditional skills.In reality, technology has made it more efficient and effective to promote traditional skills in terms of both time and space. For instance, digital platforms and social media have enabled artisans and craftsmen to showcase their work to a global audience, thereby increasing their exposure and reach. Online tutorials and videos have also made it possible for people to learn traditional skills from anywhere in the world, at any time. This has not only helped to preserve traditional techniques but has also made them more accessible and inclusive.Moreover, technology has enabled the documentation and archiving of traditional skills, allowing future generations to learn from and build upon them. Digital museums and online archives have made it possible to preserve traditional artifacts, music, and art, ensuring their survival for years to come.In conclusion, while some people may view technology as a hurdle to preserving traditional skills and ways of life, I firmly believe that it plays a vital role in promoting and preserving them. By embracing technology, we can ensure the continued relevance and appreciation of traditional skills, rather than letting them die out.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";The debate on whether creative artists should be given absolute freedom to express their ideas has been a contentious issue for a long time. While some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government, I firmly believe that the freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized.On the one hand, some individuals argue that the government should impose restrictions on artists to maintain social order and stability. One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading, which would destabilize the society. They believe that artists, with their immense influence, can shape public opinion and sway the masses towards undesirable ideologies. However, this argument is based on the assumption that the public is naive and impressionable, which is not necessarily true.On the other hand, I believe that creative freedom is essential for the growth and development of art, literature, music, and film. When artists are given the liberty to express themselves freely, they are able to push boundaries, challenge norms, and bring forth innovative ideas that can transform society for the better. History has shown us that some of the most iconic and thought-provoking works of art have been created by artists who were willing to challenge the status quo and defy conventions.Furthermore, censorship and government restriction can have a chilling effect on artistic expression, stifling creativity and limiting the scope of artistic innovation. It can also lead to a homogenization of ideas, where artists are forced to conform to societal norms, rather than challenging them.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the potential impact of artistic expression on society, I firmly believe that the benefits of creative freedom far outweigh the risks. Artists should be given the liberty to express themselves freely, without fear of government restriction or censorship. This is essential for the growth and development of art, literature, music, and film, and for the progression of society as a whole.
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The question of whether the government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes is a contentious issue. While some argue that government intervention is necessary to protect society, others believe that such control would infringe upon freedom of expression. In my opinion, I agree that some level of control is necessary, but it should be implemented judiciously.On one hand, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This can lead to a desensitization of the viewer, potentially contributing to a rise in violent behavior. Moreover, excessive violence in the media can offer misleading information to the public, creating a distorted perception of reality. For instance, the media's tendency to sensationalize violent crimes can create a false narrative that violence is more prevalent than it actually is. This can have a detrimental influence on society, fostering a culture of fear and anxiety.On the other hand, violence is an unfortunate fact of the real world, and it certainly needs to be reported. The media plays a crucial role in keeping the public informed about violent crimes, and censorship can be seen as an infringement on the freedom of the press. However, this does not mean that the media should be allowed to portray violence without any restrictions. A balance needs to be struck between reporting the facts and avoiding gratuitous or excessive violence.In conclusion, while the government should not have complete control over the media, some regulation is necessary to prevent the portrayal of excessive violence. By striking a balance between freedom of expression and responsible reporting, we can reduce the potential negative impact of media violence on society.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. The number of opportunities for women has been steadily increasing over the years. Despite this progress, some people believe that this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. However, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint. From my perspective, this development is a positive progress in human society.On the one hand, a society where females are given equal opportunities compared to males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits. Firstly, women's participation in the workforce has led to a significant increase in economic productivity and growth. As a result, many families have seen an improvement in their standard of living, and this, in turn, has led to a reduction in poverty. Moreover, women's involvement in various professions has enriched the society with their unique perspectives, skills, and experiences. For instance, women in leadership positions have brought about a more empathetic and nurturing approach to decision-making.On the other hand, some people might argue that women's empowerment has led to a breakdown in traditional family structures. They might claim that women's increasing participation in the workforce has resulted in them neglecting their domestic duties. However, I believe that these concerns are unfounded and based on outdated stereotypes. Women are perfectly capable of balancing their work and family life. In fact, many studies have shown that women's participation in the workforce has led to a more equal distribution of household chores and responsibilities.In conclusion, the increase in opportunities for women has been a blessing in disguise. It has brought about numerous benefits, including economic growth, unique perspectives, and a more equal distribution of household responsibilities. While there might be some challenges associated with this progress, I firmly believe that the advantages far outweigh the obstacles.
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";The notion that increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems has been a subject of debate among experts and policymakers. While some argue that this measure can effectively alleviate traffic congestion and reduce pollution, others disagree and propose alternative solutions. In this essay, I will examine the effectiveness of increasing petrol prices and discuss other measures that might be more effective.On one hand, raising the price of petrol can be a viable solution to mitigate traffic and pollution problems. Higher petrol prices can reduce the number of vehicles on the road, as people may opt for alternative modes of transportation, such as public transport, cycling, or walking. This, in turn, can decrease traffic congestion and lower emissions from vehicles. Additionally, a price control institution, similar to those used in farming products and real estate, can be implemented to regulate petrol prices and achieve desired outcomes.On the other hand, pollution is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to the burning of oil. Other significant contributors to pollution include chemical pollutants and excessive lighting. Therefore, increasing petrol prices alone may not be sufficient to address the problem. Moreover, such a measure may disproportionately affect low-income households, who rely heavily on private vehicles for daily commutes.Alternative measures can be more effective in tackling traffic and pollution problems. Investing in public transportation, such as buses and trains, can provide affordable and efficient alternatives to private vehicles. Implementing congestion charges, like those in London, can also discourage drivers from entering heavily congested areas. Furthermore, promoting eco-friendly technologies, such as electric or hybrid vehicles, can reduce emissions and pollution. Finally, enforcing stricter regulations on industrial emissions and waste management can also significantly decrease pollution levels.In conclusion, while increasing petrol prices may have some benefits in alleviating traffic and pollution pressure, it is not a panacea. A more comprehensive approach, incorporating a range of measures, is necessary to effectively address these complex issues.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The debate on whether advertisements should be banned has been ongoing for years, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. While some argue that advertisements are misleading and manipulative, others believe that they play a crucial role in promoting economic growth and social welfare. In this essay, I will present a nuanced view, highlighting the benefits of advertisements while acknowledging the need for regulation.On the one hand, advertisements can have a profoundly positive impact on society. Public service advertisements, for instance, are not designed to generate profits but to disseminate valued culture, promote good moral traits, and raise awareness about social issues such as disability and poverty. These advertisements play a vital role in shaping public opinion and fostering a sense of social responsibility. For example, anti-smoking campaigns have been instrumental in reducing smoking rates, while charity advertisements have raised millions of dollars for worthy causes.On the other hand, advertisements can also be used to promote products and services, driving economic growth and creating jobs. By publicizing brand image and products through mass media, companies can increase sales and expand their customer base. This, in turn, can lead to increased competition, innovation, and lower prices. Furthermore, advertisements provide consumers with valuable information about products and services, enabling them to make informed purchasing decisions.However, it is essential to acknowledge that advertisements can also be misleading and manipulative, particularly when they target vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. To mitigate these negative effects, regulations should be put in place to ensure that advertisements are truthful and transparent.In conclusion, while I do not believe that advertisements should be banned entirely, I do think that they should be regulated to prevent deception and manipulation. Public service advertisements, in particular, play a vital role in promoting social welfare and should be encouraged. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account both the benefits and drawbacks of advertisements is necessary to ensure that they serve the greater good.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;"In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. The fast-paced and competitive environment can take a toll on one's mental and physical well-being. As a result, it is essential to find effective ways to manage and reduce stress. While people have different preferences when it comes to stress relief, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is through different kinds of exercise.Exercise has been widely recognized as a natural stress-reliever, and for good reason. Not only can regular physical activity improve overall health conditions, but it also has a profound impact on mental well-being. When we exercise, our brain releases endorphins, also known as ""feel-good"" hormones, which help to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Moreover, exercise provides an outlet for pent-up emotions and frustrations, allowing us to release tension and clear our minds.Various forms of exercise can be beneficial for stress reduction. For instance, aerobic exercises such as jogging, cycling, or swimming can help to reduce stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins. Yoga, on the other hand, combines physical movement with mindfulness techniques, promoting relaxation and calmness. Even simple activities like walking or stretching can be effective in reducing stress levels.In addition to its physical and mental benefits, exercise can also provide a sense of accomplishment and self-worth, which can be particularly important for individuals dealing with high levels of stress. By incorporating exercise into our daily routine, we can improve our overall quality of life and better cope with the challenges of modern society. In conclusion, while different methods can be effective in reducing stress, I firmly believe that exercise is the most suitable and beneficial approach for modern people to manage and alleviate stress."
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";"In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?The adage ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" has been a popular maxim for a very long time, emphasizing the profound impact that images can have on communication. To a certain degree, I agree that in today's world, images serve as a more effective means of communication, especially with the advent of social media and the internet. Images have the power to convey complex ideas and emotions in a way that written words often cannot. They can transcend language barriers, evoke strong emotions, and create a sense of immediacy that written text may not be able to match. For instance, a photograph of a natural disaster can convey the severity of the situation in a way that a written description may not be able to.However, the importance of the written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication commonly used. Written words have the power to provide context, nuance, and depth to ideas and stories that images may not be able to convey. They allow for a level of complexity and precision that images often cannot match. Furthermore, written words can be used to convey abstract ideas and concepts that may not be easily represented through images. For example, a written essay can provide a detailed analysis of a complex issue in a way that an image may not be able to.In conclusion, while I agree that images are becoming a more powerful way of communication, I also believe that the written word still has a vital role to play. Ultimately, the most effective means of communication will depend on the context and purpose of the message being conveyed. A combination of both images and written words is likely to be the most effective way to communicate ideas and stories in the modern world."
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;The preservation of minority languages has sparked a heated debate regarding the allocation of public funds. While some advocate for governments to invest in saving languages spoken by small numbers of people, others dismiss this idea as a wasteful use of resources. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly, and this essay will discuss this issue.On the one hand, there are some drawbacks to saving minority languages. For instance, investing a significant amount of public money in preserving languages spoken by only a handful of people may divert funds away from more pressing social issues, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Furthermore, the benefits of preserving these languages may be limited to a small group of people, rendering the expenditure inefficient. Additionally, in an increasingly globalized world, the importance of minority languages may be seen as diminishing, as more people rely on widely spoken languages for communication and economic opportunities.On the other hand, preserving minority languages can have numerous benefits. Language is an integral part of a community's culture and identity, and losing a language can lead to the erasure of a people's heritage and history. Moreover, linguistic diversity can enrich our understanding of the world and provide valuable insights into the complexities of human communication. Governments can also use language preservation as a means to promote tourism and cultural exchange, generating revenue and fostering global understanding.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that governments should allocate some budget to preserve minority languages.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;The notion that arts and music do not contribute to the quality of life has sparked a heated debate about government funding priorities. While some argue that the government should allocate its budget to more pressing needs, I partially agree with this stance. In my opinion, the government should prioritize investing in basic social welfare, such as education and housing, over the arts.Education is a fundamental aspect of a well-rounded social system, and it plays a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of people's lives. Knowledge and wisdom are the guarantors of a society's progress, and investing in education is essential for fostering a knowledgeable and skilled population. In contrast, while arts and music can enrich people's lives, they are not the key determinants of quality of life. A person's well-being is more closely tied to their access to quality education, healthcare, and housing, rather than their exposure to art and music.Moreover, in a world where many people still lack basic necessities, it is the government's responsibility to ensure that its citizens' fundamental needs are met before investing in the arts. While arts and music can have a positive impact on society, they are not as critical to people's survival and well-being as education and housing. Therefore, I believe that the government should prioritize investing in these essential areas, rather than allocating a large portion of its budget to the arts.However, it is essential to acknowledge that arts and music do have value and can bring numerous benefits to society. They can promote cultural understanding, provide a platform for self-expression, and enrich people's lives. Therefore, while the government should not prioritize arts and music over education and housing, it should still allocate some funding to these areas to ensure that they continue to thrive and contribute to society.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;The question of whether the government should fund healthcare and education for its citizens has sparked intense debate among individuals. While some people argue that it is the government's obligation to fund these essential services, others claim that it is a waste of public money. In this essay, we will discuss both perspectives and provide our own opinion.On one hand, some people argue that it is the government's responsibility to ensure that its citizens have access to quality healthcare and education. This perspective is based on the idea that these services are fundamental rights that every individual should enjoy, regardless of their financial situation. Proponents of this argument argue that the government has a moral obligation to protect the well-being of its citizens, particularly the most vulnerable members of society, such as the poor, the elderly, and children. By funding healthcare and education, the government can help to promote social mobility, reduce poverty, and foster economic growth.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying that it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize the health and education of each citizen. They argue that individuals should take personal responsibility for their own healthcare and education, rather than relying on the government to provide these services. This perspective is based on the idea that government intervention in these areas can lead to inefficiencies and waste, and that individuals are better equipped to make decisions about their own needs.Personally, I think that the government should fund healthcare for the deprived. Healthcare is a basic human right, and it is unconscionable that individuals should be denied access to medical treatment simply because they cannot afford it. While it may be argued that education is also important, healthcare is a more pressing concern, as individuals may require urgent medical attention to save their lives. By funding healthcare for the deprived, the government can help to promote health equity, reduce healthcare disparities, and improve overall health outcomes. In contrast, education, while important, can be accessed through alternative means, such as scholarships, loans, and online resources.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;The debate about the existence of zoos in the 21st century has been a contentious issue, with many people arguing that they should no longer exist. Animal-right activists strongly recommend that wildlife belongs to their natural environment and that zoos should be banned. However, I would not go along with their viewpoint. While it is true that zoos may not be able to replicate the exact conditions of an animal's natural habitat, I believe that a well-designed man-made environment can be a better alternative.A good man-made environment can actually prolong the life span of wild animals. In the wild, animals are often exposed to harsh weather conditions, predators, and diseases, which can significantly shorten their lifespan. In contrast, zoos can provide a safe and controlled environment, where animals can receive regular veterinary care, nutrition, and shelter. This can lead to a longer and healthier life for the animals.Moreover, zoos can cultivate the notion of protecting animals and their habitats. By showcasing various species and their habitats, zoos can educate the public about the importance of conservation and the impact of human activities on the environment. This can inspire people, especially children, to take an interest in wildlife conservation and make a positive impact on the world. Additionally, many zoos are involved in breeding programs for endangered species, which can help increase the population of these animals and eventually release them back into the wild.In conclusion, while I understand the concerns of animal-right activists, I do not think that zoos should be banned entirely. A well-designed man-made environment can be a better alternative for wild animals, providing them with a longer and healthier life. Moreover, zoos can play an important role in promoting wildlife conservation and education.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;The notion that environmental degradation is an unavoidable byproduct of improving the standard of living in industrialized countries has sparked intense debate. While some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems, from my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.On the one hand, it is undeniable that the pursuit of economic growth has led to environmental concerns in some countries. The prioritization of industrialization and urbanization has resulted in the degradation of natural habitats, pollution, and climate change. Some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. For instance, the relentless pursuit of economic growth in China has led to severe air and water pollution, highlighting the need for a more balanced approach.On the other hand, I firmly believe that economic progress and environmental preservation are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many countries have successfully implemented sustainable development strategies that prioritize both economic growth and environmental protection. For example, Norway's commitment to renewable energy and sustainable forestry practices has enabled the country to maintain its natural beauty while enjoying a high standard of living.In conclusion, while some countries may prioritize economic development over environmental protection, I firmly believe that this is not an inevitable trade-off. With careful planning, sustainable practices, and a commitment to preserving the natural world, industrialized countries can enjoy economic growth while also protecting the environment. It is imperative that governments, corporations, and individuals work together to ensure that economic development is balanced with environmental stewardship, thereby creating a more sustainable future for all.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;The debate on how to allocate government funds has been a longstanding one, with some arguing that public services and facilities should be prioritized over the arts. While it is true that public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure are essential for the well-being and development of a society, I firmly believe that the arts should also be included in the government's investment portfolio.Some people suggest that tax money should be allocated to publicly beneficial services instead of the arts, as they are seen as more tangible and essential to the daily lives of citizens. However, this perspective overlooks the significant benefits that the arts can bring to a community. Arts and cultural activities have been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, social cohesion, and economic growth. They also play a crucial role in preserving a nation's heritage and identity, allowing future generations to understand and appreciate their history and culture.Moreover, investing in the arts can have a multiplier effect on the economy, creating jobs and stimulating local businesses. Many cities have successfully used arts and cultural events to revitalize urban areas, making them more attractive to tourists and businesses alike. In addition, the arts can also serve as a tool for social commentary and critique, providing a platform for artists to express their opinions and spark important discussions.In conclusion, while public services and facilities are undoubtedly essential, I strongly believe that the arts should not be neglected. By allocating a portion of government funds to the arts, we can foster a more creative, inclusive, and culturally rich society, which in turn can have numerous benefits for the economy and the well-being of citizens.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;The debate about keeping animals in zoos has been a longstanding issue, with critics arguing that it is wrong to deny them their freedom, while advocators believe that zoos play a crucial role in providing entertainment and maintaining ecological balance. In this essay, I will argue that animals should not be kept in zoos, as it is morally wrong to deny them their right to freedom.Critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because they should be considered non-human persons, with the right to freedom and autonomy. This argument is based on the idea that animals are sentient beings, capable of experiencing emotions, sensations, and cognitive processes similar to those of humans. For instance, research has shown that animals like elephants, dolphins, and primates possess complex social structures, communicate with each other, and even exhibit cultural behaviors. By keeping them in zoos, we are denying them their inherent right to live freely and make choices, which is a fundamental aspect of being a person.On the other hand, advocators of zoos argue that they provide the public with good entertainment and help to ensure the balance of ecology. While it is true that zoos offer a unique opportunity for people to learn about and appreciate wildlife, this does not justify keeping animals in captivity. In fact, many zoos are now recognizing the need to prioritize animal welfare and are moving towards more naturalistic and larger enclosures, which is a positive step.Moreover, there are alternative ways to promote ecological balance and conservation without keeping animals in captivity. For example, wildlife sanctuaries and conservation centers offer a safe haven for injured or orphaned animals, while also supporting conservation efforts in the wild. These alternatives not only prioritize animal welfare but also promote a more holistic approach to conservation.In conclusion, while zoos may provide some benefits, the moral argument that animals should be considered non-human persons with the right to freedom and autonomy is a compelling one. As we continue to learn more about animal cognition and emotions, it is essential that we re-evaluate our relationship with animals and prioritize their welfare. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to ensure that animals are treated with respect, dignity, and freedom, rather than being kept in captivity for our own entertainment.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;"The impact of advertising on our lives is a topic of ongoing debate, with some people viewing it as a positive influence while others see it as a negative one. On the one hand, many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to our lives, and therefore, it should be considered a positive activity. Advertising informs us about new products, services, and ideas, allowing us to make informed choices about how we spend our money and time. Moreover, advertising plays a crucial role in promoting cultural and social values, such as equality and environmental awareness. For instance, Dove's ""Real Beauty"" campaign challenged traditional beauty standards and encouraged self-acceptance, promoting a positive message that resonated with millions of people worldwide.On the other hand, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. One of the most significant drawbacks is the invasion of personal space, particularly with the rise of digital advertising. A huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, causing annoyance and disrupting daily life. Additionally, some advertisements promote unhealthy or unsustainable lifestyles, contributing to consumerism and waste. For example, fast food and sugary drink advertisements often target children and adolescents, promoting unhealthy eating habits that can lead to serious health problems.In my opinion, while advertising can have negative impacts, its benefits outweigh its drawbacks. Advertising has the power to shape cultural attitudes, promote social causes, and drive innovation. However, it is crucial for advertisers to be responsible and considerate of their audience, respecting personal space and promoting ethical values. Ultimately, a balanced approach to advertising, one that prioritizes both commercial goals and social responsibility, can ensure that advertising remains a positive force in our lives."
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate, with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy. While it is true that nuclear power plants do not emit greenhouse gases, as far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usage of nuclear power. I strongly disagree with the notion that the advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages.First and foremost, the risks associated with nuclear power cannot be ignored. The potential for catastrophic accidents, such as the ones that occurred in Chernobyl and Fukushima, highlight the devastating consequences of nuclear power gone wrong. The effects of these accidents can be felt for generations, contaminating land, water, and air. Moreover, the problem of nuclear waste disposal remains unresolved, posing a significant threat to human health and the environment.Furthermore, the production of nuclear energy is a complex and expensive process. The cost of building and maintaining nuclear power plants is substantial, and the investment required to ensure safety and security is considerable. Additionally, the extraction and processing of uranium, the primary fuel source for nuclear power, have significant environmental impacts, including water pollution and land degradation.While proponents argue that nuclear power provides a reliable source of energy, I would counter that the benefits of nuclear power do not outweigh the risks and costs. In fact, alternative sources of energy, such as solar and wind power, are becoming increasingly viable and cost-effective options. These renewable energy sources are not only cleaner and safer but also provide a sustainable solution to our energy needs.In conclusion, I firmly disagree that the advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. The risks, costs, and environmental impacts associated with nuclear power are significant and cannot be ignored. As we move forward, it is imperative that we prioritize the development of clean, safe, and sustainable energy sources, rather than relying on a technology that poses such significant threats to human health and the environment.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;The debate about whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city has been ongoing for years. While some argue that the countryside offers a more peaceful and natural environment, I firmly believe that big cities are a better place for bringing up children.First and foremost, education is far superior in big cities compared to the countryside. Cities have a wide range of reputable schools, universities, and other educational institutions that provide children with access to quality education and a diverse range of courses. In contrast, rural areas often have limited educational facilities, which can hinder a child's academic development. Furthermore, cities offer a wealth of cultural and extracurricular activities that can broaden a child's horizons and spark their interests.Another significant advantage of growing up in a big city is the availability of creative facilities. Cities are often home to museums, art galleries, libraries, and sports centers, which provide children with endless opportunities for learning and development. These facilities not only foster a child's creativity but also help them develop important life skills, such as teamwork and problem-solving. In contrast, children living in the countryside often spend their free time helping out on farms, which, while valuable, may not offer the same level of stimulation and variety.While it is true that the countryside can offer a peaceful and natural environment, I believe that the benefits of growing up in a big city far outweigh those of rural life. Big cities offer a unique and diverse environment that can help children develop into well-rounded and educated individuals. In conclusion, I strongly disagree that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";The debate on whether it is better to work for a company or to be one's own boss has been ongoing for a long time. In today's society, there are numerous kinds of jobs, ranging from those in government-related companies to private corporations. Both types of companies have their advantages and disadvantages, but personally, I believe that going into business for oneself is the better option.On one hand, working for a company provides a sense of security and stability. Employees are typically entitled to benefits, a fixed salary, and a clear career progression path. Moreover, working for a company can provide valuable experience and skills that can be applied to future endeavors. However, working for a company also means having to conform to the organization's rules and regulations, which can limit one's creativity and autonomy.On the other hand, going into business for oneself offers the freedom to pursue one's passions and interests without being bound by the constraints of a traditional 9-to-5 job. As one's own boss, an individual has the ability to make their own decisions, set their own schedule, and reap the rewards of their hard work. Additionally, being an entrepreneur allows one to create something from scratch, which can be incredibly fulfilling.While there are risks associated with entrepreneurship, such as financial instability and uncertainty, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Not only does being one's own boss provide a sense of pride and accomplishment, but it also allows for a better work-life balance and the opportunity to pursue innovative ideas.In conclusion, while both working for a company and going into business for oneself have their advantages and disadvantages, I firmly believe that being one's own boss is the better option. The freedom, autonomy, and potential for innovation and creativity that come with entrepreneurship make it an attractive choice for those who are willing to take the risk.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"The expression ""Never, never give up"" is a popular adage that emphasizes the importance of perseverance and persistence in achieving one's goals. It suggests that individuals should continue striving for their objectives, no matter how difficult the journey may seem. In this essay, I will argue that I strongly agree with this statement.Many individuals throughout their lives face at least one failure in different areas such as education, love, and economy. It is a natural part of the learning and growing process. Some people believe that when a defeated person faces failure, the best way is to forget about it and move on. However, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face failure. Giving up can lead to regret, disappointment, and a sense of unfulfilled potential.On the other hand, persistence in the face of failure can lead to growth, learning, and ultimately, success. Every successful person has experienced failure at some point in their lives. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" This mindset is what sets achievers apart from those who give up easily.Furthermore, persistence helps build resilience, which is essential for overcoming obstacles and staying motivated. When individuals face failure, they can choose to learn from their mistakes and use them as opportunities for growth. By doing so, they can develop a stronger sense of self-discipline, self-awareness, and self-confidence.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the expression ""Never, never give up"" is a valuable mantra that can inspire individuals to push beyond their limits and strive for their goals. By persisting in the face of failure, individuals can develop the resilience, determination, and strength needed to achieve their objectives and reach their full potential."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;The debate surrounding the preservation of land for endangered animals versus human needs has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While some people argue that saving land for endangered animals is paramount, I disagree with this point of view and believe that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry should be considered more important.Firstly, the increasing global population is a pressing issue that necessitates the expansion of farmland to meet the rising demand for food. As the world's population continues to grow, the need for agricultural land to produce sufficient food for human consumption becomes more pressing. If we prioritize saving land for endangered animals over meeting our food requirements, it could lead to food shortages and exacerbate global hunger.Secondly, housing is a fundamental human need that requires land. As the population grows, so does the need for shelters to protect people from the elements. Providing adequate housing for the increasing population is essential, and this cannot be achieved without allocating land for construction purposes. Furthermore, the absence of adequate housing can lead to social and economic problems, such as homelessness and poverty.Lastly, industrial development is crucial for meeting various human needs, including employment, healthcare, and infrastructure. Industries require land to set up their operations, and without these, we would lack many essential comforts and services that we take for granted. For instance, the pharmaceutical industry relies on land to manufacture life-saving medicines, while the energy sector requires land to establish power plants that provide electricity.In conclusion, while endangered animals are important and their preservation is necessary, human needs for farmland, housing, and industry should be considered more important. Meeting these needs is crucial for the survival and well-being of humans, and they should take precedence over saving land for endangered animals.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";"The age-old adage ""don't judge a book by its cover"" still holds true today. The statement ""one should never judge a person by external appearance"" is a notion that resonates deeply with me. As a firm believer in this phrase, I strongly agree that one's external appearance does not define their true character.Every individual possesses two distinct features: appearance and personality. While appearance refers to the physical attributes that make up a person's outer self, personality encompasses the inner qualities that define who they are as a person. From my perspective, although appearance may play a significant role in shaping our initial impressions, personality is, without a doubt, the more important of the two.A person's appearance can be deceiving, and it is often a superficial reflection of their true nature. A well-groomed and stylish individual may turn out to be shallow or unkind, while a person with a rugged exterior may possess a heart of gold. On the other hand, personality is a far more reliable indicator of a person's character. It is the sum of their values, attitudes, and behaviors that make up who they are as a person.By judging someone solely on their appearance, we risk forming inaccurate and unfair opinions about them. We may miss out on the opportunity to connect with someone truly remarkable, simply because they do not fit our conventional standards of beauty or style. Conversely, we may be drawn to someone who appears charming, only to discover that their inner qualities are lacking.In conclusion, it is imperative that we look beyond a person's external appearance and seek to understand their personality. Only then can we form meaningful connections and build lasting relationships. As the saying goes, ""it's what's inside that counts,"" and I firmly believe that it is our inner qualities that truly define us as individuals."
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;The debate surrounding the implementation of a single international language has sparked intense discussion among scholars, policymakers, and individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. On one hand, a universal language would undoubtedly facilitate global communication, economic cooperation, and cultural exchange. In today's interconnected world, a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation, enabling businesses to operate seamlessly across borders, fostering international trade, and promoting economic growth. Moreover, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions, allowing people from different countries to share ideas, values, and beliefs, thereby enriching our understanding of the world.On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage. Language is an essential component of a culture's identity, and the loss of linguistic diversity could lead to cultural homogenization. The adoption of a single international language might overshadow local languages, causing them to fade away, and ultimately, erode the unique characteristics that define a nation's history, customs, and traditions. It is crucial that we strike a balance between promoting a universal language and preserving the linguistic diversity that makes our world so rich and fascinating.In conclusion, while a single international language has its benefits, it is equally important to recognize the value of linguistic diversity and the significance of preserving cultural heritage. Perhaps, a more feasible approach would be to promote a universal language as a secondary language, allowing individuals to maintain their native language while also being proficient in a global language. This way, we can harness the advantages of a universal language while safeguarding the unique cultural identities that make our world so diverse and vibrant.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;The notion that fashion trends are merely a ploy to sell clothes has sparked a heated debate. Some argue that individuals should disregard these trends and opt for dressing in what makes them feel confident and comfortable. While this approach has its merits, I firmly believe that fashion trends play a more vital role in people's lives than personal dressing styles.On one hand, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. They argue that this approach allows individuals to express their unique identity and avoid conforming to societal pressures. Moreover, personal styles often foster creativity and self-expression, as individuals can mix and match different pieces to create a look that truly represents them. On the other hand, from my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles. This is because following trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations. Fashion trends often reflect the cultural, social, and economic shifts happening globally. By embracing these trends, individuals can stay connected to the world around them, demonstrating their awareness and adaptability. Fashion trends also provide a sense of community and belonging, as people from diverse backgrounds come together to celebrate the latest styles.Furthermore, fashion trends drive innovation and creativity in the industry. Designers and brands are constantly pushing the boundaries of fashion, experimenting with new materials, silhouettes, and colors. This innovation trickles down to the masses, making high-end fashion more accessible and affordable.In conclusion, while personal dressing styles have their advantages, I firmly believe that fashion trends play a more vital role in people's lives. By embracing these trends, individuals can stay connected to the world around them, demonstrate their adaptability, and celebrate creativity and innovation in the industry.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";The debate on whether wealthy nations should share their wealth with poorer nations has been a contentious issue for years. While some argue that it is the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves, others believe that wealthy nations have a moral obligation to provide aid to those in need. In this essay, I will argue that wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor, as it is not only a moral imperative but also economically beneficial.Firstly, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty. The statistics on global poverty are staggering, with millions of people living on less than $1.90 a day. In such a world, it is unconscionable for wealthy nations to turn a blind eye to the suffering of others. Providing aid such as food and education is not only a moral obligation but also a basic human right. Wealthy nations have a responsibility to ensure that their fellow human beings have access to the basic necessities of life.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. When poor nations receive aid, they are able to invest in their human capital, which in turn boosts their economic growth. This, in turn, creates new markets and trade opportunities for wealthy nations. Furthermore, a more stable and prosperous global economy benefits everyone, as it reduces the risk of global conflicts and promotes international cooperation.In conclusion, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor. It is a moral imperative, an economic necessity, and a human right. While the governments of poorer nations do have a responsibility to look after their citizens, they often lack the resources to do so. Wealthy nations have a duty to provide aid and support to those in need, not only to alleviate human suffering but also to promote global economic growth and stability.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;I strongly agree with the statement that a large proportion of our country's health budget should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures. In my opinion, this is a wise and forward-thinking approach to improving the overall health and wellbeing of our citizens.Firstly, health education is crucial in promoting long-term positive effects on our next generations. By investing in health education, we can empower future generations with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed choices about their health and lifestyle. This, in turn, can lead to a significant reduction in the prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, which are major burdens on our healthcare system.Secondly, health education prepares people with the necessary knowledge to protect themselves from the risks of diseases. By educating individuals about healthy habits, disease prevention, and early detection, we can reduce the incidence of illnesses and the need for costly medical interventions. For example, educating people about the importance of vaccination, healthy diet, and regular exercise can help prevent illnesses such as influenza, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.Thirdly, preventative measures, such as regular health check-ups, screenings, and disease prevention programs, can help improve the general health state of all citizens. By identifying and addressing health issues early on, we can prevent complications and reduce the need for expensive treatments. For instance, regular blood pressure checks can help identify individuals at risk of heart disease, allowing for early intervention and prevention.Lastly, the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention. According to various studies, every dollar invested in prevention can save up to three dollars in treatment costs. By prioritizing prevention and health education, we can reduce the financial burden on our healthcare system and allocate resources more efficiently.In conclusion, diverting a large proportion of our country's health budget from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures is a sound investment in the health and wellbeing of our citizens. By empowering individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect their health, we can improve the overall health state of our population, reduce the burden on our healthcare system, and allocate resources more efficiently.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;The increasing popularity of news media has had a profound impact on people's lives, and opinions about its effects are varied. While some argue that it has a negative influence, others see it as a beneficial development. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and argue that, despite some drawbacks, the overall impact of news media is positive.On one hand, many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. For instance, the 24-hour news cycle can create a culture of sensationalism, where the pursuit of ratings and clicks leads to the spread of misinformation and the amplification of negative news. This can contribute to a culture of fear, anxiety, and mistrust. Furthermore, the constant bombardment of news can be overwhelming, leading to a sense of fatigue and disengagement.On the other hand, it is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people's knowledge. News outlets provide a platform for educational programming, documentaries, and in-depth analysis of current events. This can lead to a more informed and engaged citizenry, which is essential for a healthy democracy. Additionally, news media can raise awareness about important social and environmental issues, inspiring people to take action and make a positive impact.Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that the popularity of news media is a positive development. While there are valid concerns about the potential negative effects of news media, its benefits in terms of education, awareness, and civic engagement outweigh these drawbacks. Moreover, the increasing accessibility of news media through digital platforms has democratized access to information, making it possible for people to seek out diverse perspectives and sources.In conclusion, the popularity of news media is a complex issue with both positive and negative consequences. However, when weighing the advantages and disadvantages, it appears that the benefits of news media in terms of education, awareness, and civic engagement make it a positive development.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;"The statement that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way is one that I largely agree with.On the one hand, international sporting occasions like the football World Cup can help reduce international tensions remarkably. Sport has a unique ability to unite people across cultures and borders, promoting a sense of global citizenship. When nations come together to compete in a spirit of healthiness, honesty, and fairness, it helps strengthen understanding, friendship, and solidarity among nations. This can be particularly significant in times of heightened tensions between countries, providing a platform for diplomacy and cooperation. For instance, the famous 1985 ""Hand of God"" football match between Argentina and England, which took place during a time of tense relations following the Falklands War, played a crucial role in rebuilding diplomatic relations.On the other hand, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. The World Cup is often seen as a celebration of national pride, with fans proudly waving their flags and donning their national colours. While this can sometimes boil over into nationalism, it generally provides a safe outlet for the release of patriotic emotions. This is particularly important in an increasingly fragmented world, where tensions between nations can often seem insurmountable. By providing a platform for national pride to be expressed in a controlled environment, international sporting events help to ensure that this pride does not spill over into conflict.In conclusion, while there may be some instances where national tensions rise during sporting events, the overall impact of international sporting occasions like the football World Cup is undoubtedly positive. By promoting national pride, international understanding, and a sense of global citizenship, these events are crucial in releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way and reducing international tensions."
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work, sparking a heated debate about its morality and effectiveness. While some people regard it as a violation of children's rights, others see it as a valuable work experience that fosters learning and responsibility. In my opinion, the benefits of children's engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.On one hand, it is true that many countries educate children from a young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Engaging in paid work can be a practical application of these values, teaching children the importance of hard work, time management, and financial literacy. Moreover, it can help children develop a sense of self-worth and confidence, as they earn their own money and contribute to their family's income.On the other hand, some people think that involving children in paid work is not a good educational measure. They argue that it can lead to exploitation, distraction from studies, and harm to their physical and emotional well-being. However, I believe that these risks can be mitigated with proper regulation, supervision, and safeguards. For instance, many countries have laws that restrict the types of work children can do, the number of hours they can work, and the minimum age for employment.From my point of view, the benefits of children's engagement in paid work far outweigh its drawbacks. Not only does it provide them with valuable life skills and experience, but it also helps them develop a strong work ethic and a sense of responsibility. As long as children's rights and well-being are protected, I believe that paid work can be a positive and empowering experience for young people.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;In recent years, it has become an increasingly common trend for young people to take a break between finishing high school and starting university studies. Many students choose to use this time to travel, work, or volunteer, and while this decision has its advantages and disadvantages, the benefits often outweigh the drawbacks.On the one hand, taking a break can be incredibly enriching for young people. Some students choose to travel all around the world during this time, immersing themselves in different cultures and meeting people from diverse backgrounds. This experience can go a long way in broadening their perspectives and enhancing their confidence. On the other hand, some students opt to take up a job, which not only provides them with financial independence but also equips them with valuable work experience. In both cases, the experience gained during this break makes students more independent and self-reliant.Moreover, the skills and knowledge acquired during this time can be highly beneficial when they eventually start their university studies. For instance, a student who has traveled extensively may have developed strong problem-solving skills, adaptability, and resourcefulness, all of which can serve them well in their academic pursuits. Similarly, a student who has worked during their break may have honed their time management skills, discipline, and teamwork abilities, all of which are essential for success in university.In conclusion, taking a break between finishing high school and starting university studies can be a highly rewarding experience for young people. While there may be some drawbacks, such as the potential loss of academic momentum, the advantages of increased confidence, independence, and valuable life skills make it a worthwhile decision. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the experience and skills gained during this break can only serve to enhance their future academic and professional pursuits.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. The notion that a university or similar academic institution is the sole bastion of learning the qualities required for success is a widely debated topic. While I do agree with this opinion to a certain degree, I firmly believe that it is not the only path to achieving success.On one hand, universities and academic institutions provide students with a solid foundation of knowledge and skills that are crucial for success in various fields. They offer a structured learning environment, expert guidance, and opportunities for networking, all of which are essential for personal and professional growth. Moreover, many professions, such as law, medicine, and engineering, require specialized knowledge and training that can only be obtained through formal education. In these cases, a university degree is often a prerequisite for success.However, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports, where talent, dedication, and hard work are the primary determinants of success. Many successful artists, musicians, and athletes have achieved greatness without formal education, instead relying on their natural abilities, passion, and perseverance. Furthermore, the rise of entrepreneurship and online learning platforms has democratized access to knowledge and skills, enabling individuals to acquire the necessary tools for success outside of traditional academic institutions.In conclusion, while I agree that universities and academic institutions play a significant role in imparting knowledge and skills necessary for success, I also believe that they are not the only means to achieving success. With the ever-evolving nature of work and the increasing availability of alternative learning paths, it is clear that success can be achieved through various routes. Ultimately, it is the individual's drive, creativity, and resilience that will determine their success in today's competitive world.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";The advent of technology has made it possible for people to access historical objects and artworks from the comfort of their own homes. As a result, some individuals believe that public museums and art galleries will become obsolete. While it is true that the internet provides convenience and accessibility, I disagree with this notion and firmly believe that public museums and art galleries will continue to be necessary.On the one hand, it is undeniable that the internet has revolutionized the way we consume art and historical artifacts. Most people nowadays prefer to use the internet to search for artworks, as it brings them convenience and saves time. With just a few clicks, one can access a vast array of artworks and historical objects from around the world. However, I argue that this convenience comes at a cost. When we view artworks online, we are limited to a screen size, which cannot replicate the experience of seeing a physical piece up close.In contrast, public museums and art galleries offer a unique and immersive experience that cannot be replicated online. Visitors can see the artworks in person, take in the details, and appreciate the scale and texture of the pieces. Moreover, museums and galleries provide a spiritual experience that goes beyond mere visual appreciation. They offer a sense of community, a chance to engage with others who share similar interests, and an opportunity to learn from experts and curators. In short, while the internet provides accessibility, it cannot replace the tangible experience of visiting a museum or gallery.In conclusion, while the internet has made it possible to access artworks and historical objects online, public museums and art galleries will still be necessary. They provide a unique and immersive experience that cannot be replicated online, and they offer a spiritual experience that goes beyond mere visual appreciation. As such, I firmly believe that public museums and art galleries will continue to play an important role in our cultural landscape.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;The practice of withholding a defendant's past criminal record from a jury in British and Australian courts has sparked a heated debate among lawyers and legal experts. While some argue that this information is crucial in reaching a fair verdict, others contend that it is essential to protect the accused and ensure an objective decision-making process. In this essay, I will argue that the current practice should remain in place, and that a jury should only be provided with details relevant to the specific case at hand.In contrast to British and Australian courts, many countries' legal systems provide juries with a defendant's full history. This approach is often based on the assumption that past behavior is a reliable indicator of future actions. However, this perspective overlooks the fact that individuals can change and grow over time. Moreover, introducing a defendant's past criminal record can lead to prejudice and bias among jurors, compromising the fairness of the trial.On the other hand, it is crucial that juries are provided with all relevant information pertaining to the specific case they are trying. This ensures that they can make an informed decision based on the evidence presented, rather than relying on assumptions or speculation. By limiting the information provided to the jury to only what is relevant to the case, the court can minimize the risk of prejudice and ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial.In conclusion, while some lawyers may argue that a jury should be provided with a defendant's full history, I firmly believe that the current practice in British and Australian courts should remain in place. By only providing juries with relevant information, the court can safeguard the rights of the accused and promote an objective decision-making process. Ultimately, this approach ensures that justice is served, and that the defendant is judged solely on the evidence presented in the case at hand.
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;The impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. On one hand, the Internet has revolutionized the way we learn and access information, making it easier for students to acquire knowledge. With the ability to put lectures online, university lecturers have made it possible for students to access course materials at their own pace and convenience. This has led to a reduction in the importance of attending face-to-face lectures, as students can now access the same information from the comfort of their own homes.However, critics may argue that the Internet has several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively. For instance, the lack of face-to-face interaction with lecturers and peers can hinder students' ability to engage in discussions, ask questions, and clarify doubts. Moreover, the abundance of information available online can be overwhelming, leading to information overload and distractions.Despite these drawbacks, I firmly believe that the use of the Internet in formal education is a good idea. In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. The Internet provides students with a wealth of information, resources, and opportunities for collaboration and learning. It also enables lecturers to create interactive and engaging course materials, making learning a more enjoyable and effective experience.Furthermore, the Internet has opened up new avenues for distance learning, making education accessible to people who may not have had the opportunity to pursue higher education otherwise. With the Internet, students can now access high-quality educational resources from anywhere in the world, at any time.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the impact of the Internet on schooling, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential that educators and policymakers work together to harness the power of the Internet to create a more inclusive, effective, and engaging education system.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;The issue of inaccessible medication in undeveloped countries is a pressing concern, with a large number of patients suffering from deaths caused by a lack of medication rather than the diseases themselves. In response, it has been suggested that pharmaceutical companies in developed countries ought to reduce the price of their medicines, making them more affordable for those in need. On the surface, this proposal seems reasonable and even altruistic. However, a closer examination reveals that the current cost of medicines is, in fact, reasonable and based on their effectiveness.While it is true that the prices of certain medications can be prohibitively expensive for individuals in undeveloped countries, it is essential to consider the significant investment required to research, develop, and test new drugs. Pharmaceutical companies pour billions of dollars into the discovery of new treatments, and their pricing reflects the need to recoup these costs. Furthermore, the high prices of medications in developed countries help to fund the development of new treatments and ensure the continued innovation of the pharmaceutical industry.Rather than obliging companies to reduce their prices, alternative solutions should be explored. For instance, governments, NGOs, and international organizations can collaborate to provide subsidies or funding for medication in undeveloped countries. Additionally, pharmaceutical companies can be encouraged to offer tiered pricing models, where they offer their products at reduced prices in low-income countries. Ultimately, a balanced approach that acknowledges both the needs of patients in undeveloped countries and the necessity of supporting the pharmaceutical industry's continued innovation is required to address this critical issue effectively.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;The debate about smoking in public places and workplaces has been ongoing for years. While some argue that individuals have the right to smoke, others claim that it is a harmful habit that should be restricted. I strongly agree that businesses and governments should prohibit smoking in their premises and public places, respectively.The awareness of the harmful effects of smoking among the general public has put immense pressure on the government and private sectors to take action. As a result, some businesses have taken the initiative to prohibit smoking in their offices, and some governments have banned smoking in all public places. This move is a step in the right direction, as it not only promotes a healthy environment but also sets a good example for the community.Restricting smoking in public areas and workplaces has numerous benefits. Firstly, it reduces the risk of second-hand smoke exposure, which is a significant health hazard. Secondly, it discourages smoking among employees and citizens, which can lead to a reduction in smoking-related health problems. Furthermore, a smoke-free environment projects a positive image of a nation, showcasing its commitment to public health and well-being.In the long run, this move will do more good than harm. A healthier population translates to reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity, and a better quality of life. Moreover, a smoke-free nation will attract tourists, investors, and talent, contributing to the country's economic growth.In conclusion, prohibiting smoking in public places and workplaces is a forward-thinking decision that prioritizes public health and the nation's image. I firmly believe that this move will have a positive impact on the community, and I support businesses and governments that have taken steps to restrict smoking in their premises and public areas.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";"The debate about whether humans are harming or improving the quality of life on Earth has been a longstanding one. While some argue that our activities are enhancing the planet, I firmly believe that our actions are indeed causing harm to the Earth.The slogan ""Save the planet Earth"" has become a ubiquitous phrase, echoing across the globe. This rallying cry is not merely a sentimental appeal; it stems from genuine concerns that are vital to our planet's well-being. One of the primary reasons for this concern is the alarming rate at which we are depleting the ozone layer. The large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants, such as those found in air conditioners, have significantly contributed to this depletion. This, in turn, has exposed our planet to harmful ultraviolet radiation, posing a threat to both human health and the environment.Furthermore, human activities such as deforestation, pollution, and climate change are also causing irreparable damage to the Earth. The rampant destruction of forests has not only led to loss of biodiversity but also exacerbated the greenhouse effect, accelerating global warming. Similarly, the reckless discharge of pollutants into our oceans and waterways has contaminated our water sources, affecting both human consumption and aquatic life.In conclusion, while some may argue that our activities are improving the quality of life on Earth, I strongly disagree. The overwhelming evidence suggests that our actions are, in fact, harming the planet. It is our responsibility to acknowledge these concerns and take corrective measures to mitigate the damage. By adopting sustainable practices, reducing our carbon footprint, and conserving natural resources, we can work towards preserving the Earth for future generations."
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The notion that companies should encourage high-level employees over 55 to retire to give opportunities to new generations has sparked intense debate. While the idea may seem appealing, I strongly disagree with this proposition. Sacrificing senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences that can have far-reaching consequences.On a personal level, forcing older employees to retire can foster a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. Many of these experienced workers have dedicated their lives to their companies, contributing significantly to their growth and success. Pushing them out can be demotivating and demoralizing, leading to feelings of betrayal and undervaluation. Furthermore, this approach disregards the wealth of knowledge and expertise that older workers bring to the table, which is invaluable to the development of younger employees.Moreover, massively forcing early retirement would be a significant financial burden to the local government. With a substantial number of employees retiring early, the government would need to provide financial support and benefits, straining the social security system. This could lead to increased taxes, reduced benefits for other citizens, or even cuts in essential public services. Additionally, the sudden loss of experienced workers can lead to a brain drain, resulting in reduced productivity and efficiency within companies, ultimately affecting the economy.Rather than forcing retirement, companies should focus on creating a more inclusive and diverse work environment that values employees of all ages. This can be achieved through mentorship programs, training, and opportunities for growth and development, allowing older workers to share their expertise while also learning from their younger counterparts. By embracing an intergenerational approach, companies can tap into the collective knowledge and experience of their employees, driving innovation, productivity, and success.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;The media, encompassing the press, television, and the internet, plays a pivotal role in modern society as a conduit for information dissemination. A contentious issue related to mass media is the correct amount of control imposed on newspapers, televisions, and websites. This debate revolves around whether the media should be subject to stricter controls or if existing regulations should be relaxed, granting the public freer access to information.On one hand, there are compelling arguments in favor of tighter media control. One of the strong arguments is the need to limit the amount of violent and sexual content in media. Exposure to such content, especially among minors, can lead to desensitization and potentially influence behavior in harmful ways. Moreover, television companies frequently import foreign programs that may carry cultural or societal values different from those of the local audience. This could lead to the adoption of these ideas, potentially affecting the cultural identity and moral fabric of the society.However, the major opposing argument against stricter control is the need to protect freedom of expression and access to information. The media serves as a watchdog over the government and other powerful entities, ensuring accountability and transparency. Overly restrictive controls can stifle this critical function, leading to a lack of information and a disempowered citizenry. Furthermore, the ability of citizens to access a wide range of information is essential for making informed decisions in a democratic society.In conclusion, while there are valid reasons for imposing stricter controls on the media to protect society from harmful content and maintain cultural integrity, the need to safeguard freedom of expression and access to information outweighs these concerns. Loosening controls on the media, while maintaining reasonable safeguards against harmful content, can ensure that citizens are well-informed and able to engage actively in the democratic process.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;The role of citizens in a society is a topic of ongoing debate. While some individuals believe that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society, others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. In my opinion, I strongly agree with the latter group, as I believe that citizens have a multitude of duties that go beyond just paying taxes.On one hand, some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens. They think that as long as they are paying their taxes, they are doing their part in contributing to the society. However, I disagree with this notion. Paying taxes is indeed an important responsibility, but it is just one aspect of being a citizen. In order to develop a country, citizens must also obey laws, which were imposed by the government to maintain social order and protect the rights of individuals. By obeying laws, citizens demonstrate their respect for the social contract and contribute to the overall stability of the society.Moreover, citizens should also protect the country's culture and history. This can be done by participating in cultural events, preserving historical sites, and passing down traditions to future generations. By doing so, citizens play a crucial role in preserving the country's identity and ensuring that its heritage is not lost. Furthermore, citizens can also contribute to the society by volunteering, participating in community service, and engaging in environmentally friendly practices. These actions not only benefit the individual but also have a positive impact on the community as a whole.In conclusion, while paying taxes is an important responsibility of citizens, it is by no means the only one. As citizens, we have a duty to obey laws, protect the country's culture and history, and contribute to the society in various ways. By doing so, we can work together to build a better society and ensure the prosperity of our country.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;Animal testing has long been a contentious issue, with proponents arguing that it has led to numerous groundbreaking medical discoveries, while opponents contend that the practice is inhumane and unnecessary. While it is true that many medical treatments have been discovered through animal testing, including life-saving cancer and HIV drugs, I firmly believe that animal testing should be made illegal.On one hand, it is undeniable that animal testing has played a crucial role in advancing medical research. Many treatments and drugs have been developed and refined through testing on animals, and it is estimated that millions of human lives have been saved as a result. For instance, animal testing was instrumental in the development of the polio vaccine, which has all but eradicated the disease worldwide.On the other hand, there are several compelling reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs of animal testing far outweigh the benefits. Animal testing is a costly and time-consuming process, requiring significant resources and funding. Moreover, the use of animals in testing is often unnecessary, as alternative methods such as in vitro testing and computer simulations are available and have proven to be effective.Furthermore, animals are often kept in unnatural conditions, subjected to pain, stress, and discomfort, which is morally unacceptable. Animals are living beings with feelings and emotions, and it is our responsibility to treat them with respect and compassion. The use of animals in testing also raises important ethical questions about the value and dignity of animal life.In conclusion, while animal testing has undoubtedly contributed to medical progress, I firmly believe that the costs outweigh the benefits and that alternative methods should be explored and utilized. It is our moral obligation to treat animals with respect and dignity, and to prioritize their welfare over scientific progress. Therefore, animal testing should be made illegal.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";"The use of formal ""pen and paper"" examinations is a long-standing tradition in education systems worldwide, serving as a primary method of assessing learning. However, there is a growing concern among educators and students that this approach may not be the most effective way to measure academic achievement. In my opinion, while examinations do possess certain advantages, their role in modern education should be reevaluated to accommodate the diverse needs of learners.On the one hand, examinations offer several benefits. They provide a standardized and fair means of evaluating students' knowledge, as all candidates are subjected to the same conditions and assessment criteria. This uniformity ensures that students are held to the same standards, reducing bias and promoting a level playing field. Additionally, exams can motivate students to work diligently and manage their time effectively, as they prepare for a specific goal.On the other hand, relying heavily on examinations can have negative consequences. Overemphasis on exams can lead to a narrow focus on rote memorization and regurgitation of information, rather than encouraging critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, the high-stakes nature of exams can cause significant stress and anxiety for students, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.In light of these concerns, it is essential to reconsider the role of examinations in education. While they should not be eliminated entirely, their significance should be balanced with other assessment methods that value different skills and abilities. Alternative approaches, such as project-based evaluations, presentations, and peer assessments, can provide a more comprehensive picture of a student's academic achievement and potential. By adopting a more diverse and flexible approach to assessment, we can create a more inclusive and effective education system that prepares students for success in an increasingly complex and dynamic world."
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;Improvements in health, education, and trade are vital components in the development of poorer nations. For these countries to break the cycle of poverty and advance economically, it is imperative that they prioritize these three areas. However, the governments of richer nations also have a crucial role to play in supporting these efforts.In the realm of health, richer nations can make a significant impact by providing medical expertise and resources. By delegating doctors and nurses to work in poorer nations, they can help address the severe shortage of medical professionals in these countries. Moreover, donating funds to build hospitals and healthcare facilities can greatly improve access to quality medical care. For instance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which is supported by richer nations, has been instrumental in combating these diseases in poorer countries.Similarly, in education, richer nations can offer valuable support by providing opportunities for students from poorer nations to pursue higher education. By offering scholarships and loans to qualified students, they can enable them to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to drive development in their home countries. This can be particularly effective in fields such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), where there is often a significant shortage of expertise in poorer nations. Additionally, online educational resources and platforms can also be made available to students in poorer nations, bridging the educational divide.In trade, richer nations can help by providing access to their markets and technology. By reducing trade barriers and sharing knowledge, they can enable poorer nations to develop their industries and increase their exports. This, in turn, can help to create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and reduce poverty.In conclusion, improvements in health, education, and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. While these countries must take the lead in addressing these challenges, the governments of richer nations have a critical role to play in supporting these efforts. By providing medical expertise, educational opportunities, and access to markets and technology, richer nations can help poorer nations to break the cycle of poverty and achieve sustainable development.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;The integration of computers in education has undoubtedly transformed the learning experience, offering unparalleled access to information and innovative learning tools. However, the notion that this technological advancement will soon render teachers obsolete in the classroom is a misconception.Teachers play a multifaceted role that extends far beyond the dissemination of knowledge. They are not just educators, but also mentors, friends, and counselors who provide emotional support and guidance to their students. A computer, no matter how advanced, can never replicate the human touch that a teacher brings to the classroom. While a computer can process and deliver information, it lacks the ability to communicate with pupils on a personal level, to understand their individual needs, and to offer the kind of emotional support that is essential for a student's holistic development.Moreover, teachers serve as role models, inspiring and motivating their students to reach their full potential. They embody values such as empathy, kindness, and perseverance, which are essential for a student's social and emotional growth. A computer, on the other hand, is an inanimate object that cannot inspire or motivate in the same way. It lacks the capacity to form meaningful relationships with students, which are critical for building trust, fostering creativity, and promoting a love of learning.While computers will undoubtedly continue to play an increasingly important role in education, they will never replace the nuanced and multifaceted role that teachers play in the classroom. Instead, technology should be seen as a tool that complements the work of teachers, freeing them from administrative tasks and enabling them to focus on what they do best: inspiring, guiding, and nurturing their students. In conclusion, the role of teachers in the classroom is not only about imparting knowledge, but also about fostering emotional intelligence, social skills, and personal growth, making them an indispensable part of the educational process.
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;The production of food has undergone significant transformations in recent years, with the incorporation of advanced plant foods and newly developed devices. These innovations have led to a substantial reduction in the cost of producing farm products, making food more accessible to people around the world. However, the increasing reliance on high-tech fertilizers and electronic equipment for harvesting has raised concerns about the potential risks to human health and the negative impacts on local communities.On one hand, advanced fertilizers have greatly improved crop yields, leading to increased food production and lower costs. Additionally, machinery such as drones and autonomous tractors have streamlined the farming process, enabling farmers to cultivate and harvest their land more efficiently. These advancements have not only reduced the financial burden on farmers but also made food more affordable for consumers.On the other hand, the use of high-tech fertilizers poses a potential threat to individuals' health and well-being. The excessive use of these chemicals can contaminate soil, air, and water, leading to long-term health problems for people living in nearby communities. Moreover, the over-reliance on electronic equipment for harvesting has several negative impacts on society. For instance, the loss of jobs for manual laborers has been significant, leading to economic instability in rural areas. Furthermore, the dependence on technology has also led to the decline of traditional farming practices, which are not only environmentally friendly but also culturally significant.In conclusion, while the use of advanced plant foods and newly developed devices has significantly reduced the cost of producing farm products, it is crucial to weigh the benefits against the potential risks to human health and the negative impacts on local communities. A balanced approach that incorporates technology with sustainable and traditional farming practices is necessary to ensure that food production is not only cost-effective but also safe and responsible.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;The suggestion that governments should not continue to fund artists has sparked a heated debate in recent times. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several compelling reasons.First and foremost, art plays a significant role in improving the quality of our lives. It has the power to inspire, educate, and unite people across cultures and communities. Artists have the ability to express emotions, ideas, and experiences through their work, which can evoke feelings, spark conversations, and challenge societal norms. By supporting artists, governments can ensure that this creative expression continues to thrive, enriching our lives and fostering a more empathetic and open-minded society.Furthermore, art is a vital component of a country's tourism industry. Museums, galleries, and cultural festivals attract millions of visitors each year, generating significant revenue and creating jobs. In fact, according to the World Tourism Organization, cultural tourism accounts for over 30% of global tourism. By investing in artists and the arts, governments can stimulate local economies, promote cultural exchange, and showcase their unique heritage to the world.In addition, funding for the arts can have a positive impact on local communities. Public art installations, for example, can transform urban spaces, making them more vibrant and welcoming. Arts programs in schools can also provide young people with essential skills, such as creativity, critical thinking, and self-expression.In conclusion, while some people may argue that governments should prioritize other areas of spending, I firmly believe that supporting artists is essential for the well-being of our society. By investing in the arts, governments can improve the quality of our lives, attract tourists, and stimulate local economies.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The relentless pursuit of technological advancements has undeniably led to significant environmental concerns. As the world grapples with the consequences of development in technology, two distinct schools of thought have emerged. On one hand, some individuals advocate for a simpler way of life, suggesting that a drastic reduction in technology usage is the only viable solution to mitigate environmental problems. On the other hand, there are those who firmly believe that technology, in and of itself, holds the key to resolving the world's environmental woes.Proponents of a simpler way of life argue that the rampant consumption and waste generated by technological advancements are the primary drivers of environmental degradation. They propose that a return to a more modest, self-sufficient lifestyle, devoid of the trappings of modern technology, would significantly reduce humanity's ecological footprint. This perspective is rooted in the notion that technology is inherently detrimental to the environment and that a more primitive way of living is the only means of preserving the natural world.In contrast, others contend that technology is not the problem, but rather the solution to environmental problems. They point to recent breakthroughs in fields such as renewable energy, sustainable materials, and eco-friendly infrastructure as evidence that technology can be a powerful tool in the quest for a more environmentally harmonious world. According to this viewpoint, we are on the cusp of an era where engineering and technology are poised to make a profound, positive impact on the environment.In my opinion, the latter perspective is more convincing. While it is true that technology has contributed to environmental problems, it is also capable of providing innovative solutions. By harnessing the power of technology, we can develop more efficient, sustainable systems that minimize waste and pollution. Moreover, technology can facilitate global cooperation and knowledge-sharing, enabling the international community to tackle environmental challenges with greater efficacy.Ultimately, the key to resolving environmental problems lies not in abandoning technology, but in harnessing its potential to create a more sustainable future. By acknowledging the capacity of technology to drive positive change, we can work towards a world where development and environmental stewardship are mutually reinforcing, rather than mutually exclusive.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The topic of whether professional athletes and entertainers are paid too much money for their work has been a subject of debate for a long time. Some people believe that their salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year, are reasonable and reflect the value they bring to society. However, a closer examination of their actual contributions reveals a different story.On the one hand, proponents of high salaries for athletes and entertainers argue that they possess exceptional abilities that set them apart from others. For instance, a talented singer like Taylor Swift or a skilled football player like Cristiano Ronaldo has a unique gift that brings joy and entertainment to millions of people worldwide. Their exceptional abilities, combined with their hard work and dedication, justify their high earnings.On the other hand, critics argue that athletes and entertainers contribute insignificantly to the development of society. While they may bring temporary entertainment and pleasure, their work does not have a lasting impact on people's lives or contribute to the betterment of society as a whole. In contrast, essential workers like doctors, teachers, and engineers, who earn a fraction of what athletes and entertainers make, have a much more significant and lasting impact on society.For example, a doctor who saves lives every day or a teacher who educates future generations earns a salary that is a tiny fraction of what a football player or singer earns. This disparity in earnings highlights the imbalance in how we value different professions and the contributions they make to society. Moreover, the millions of dollars earned by athletes and entertainers could be better spent on addressing pressing social issues, such as poverty, education, and healthcare.In conclusion, while some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, a closer examination of their contributions to society reveals that they are, in fact, overpaid. Their exceptional abilities, while valuable, do not justify the enormous sums of money they earn, especially when compared to the more significant contributions of essential workers.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;The role of computers and the internet in a child's education has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that these technological advancements are more crucial for learning than traditional schooling, others believe that schools and teachers are indispensable for effective education. In this essay, we will discuss both perspectives and provide an opinion on the matter.Proponents of the idea that computers and the internet are more important for a child's education than going to school argue that the global online network is an inexhaustible source of information. With just a few clicks, students can access a vast array of educational resources, including e-books, online tutorials, and educational websites. Moreover, online learning platforms and courses have made it possible for students to learn at their own pace, anytime, and anywhere. Some even believe that computers and the internet will eventually supplant the traditional role of teachers, making schools obsolete.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits of the internet are undeniable, there are certain shortcomings that cannot be overlooked. For instance, the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers can hinder social skills development, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Moreover, the internet is not always a reliable source of information, and students may be exposed to misinformation, biases, and distractions. Teachers, on the other hand, provide guidance, support, and feedback, helping students to navigate complex information and develop critical thinking skills.In my opinion, while computers and the internet are valuable tools for learning, they cannot replace the essential role of schools and teachers. A balanced approach that combines the benefits of technology with the guidance of teachers is the most effective way to ensure that children receive a well-rounded education. By leveraging the strengths of both traditional schooling and online learning, we can provide students with the skills, knowledge, and support they need to succeed in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";"The debate surrounding capital punishment, or the death penalty, has long been a contentious issue in many countries. On one hand, proponents of the death penalty argue that it is a necessary tool in controlling the amount of violent crimes in society. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, the death penalty may be seen as an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. The rationale behind this argument is that the fear of death will act as a deterrent, preventing individuals from committing heinous crimes. Additionally, the death penalty can be seen as a means of providing justice and closure to the victims' families.On the other hand, as society grows and human rights become more highly respected, the idea of ""murdering"" criminals becomes increasingly immoral and hard to accept. Many argue that the death penalty is a form of state-sanctioned murder, which undermines the moral fabric of our society. Moreover, the risk of executing an innocent person is a very real concern, as evidenced by numerous cases of wrongful convictions. The death penalty also raises questions about its effectiveness as a deterrent, with many studies suggesting that it has little impact on crime rates.In conclusion, while the death penalty may be seen as a necessary tool in controlling violent crime, its morality and effectiveness are highly debatable. As society continues to evolve and human rights become more respected, the death penalty becomes increasingly difficult to justify. Ultimately, alternative forms of punishment, such as life imprisonment, may be more effective and moral ways of dealing with violent crime."
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;The statement that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit is a highly debated topic. On one hand, it is undeniable that companies, factories, and businesses are established to provide products that meet people's needs and generate profits for their owners and managers. The primary objective of any business is to maximize its profits and stay competitive in the market. However, if left unregulated, businesses can pose a significant threat to the well-being of humans, animals, and the environment. Without any control or oversight, businesses may prioritize profits over sustainability and social responsibility. They may engage in exploitative practices, such as producing low-quality products at high prices, taking advantage of unsuspecting consumers. This can lead to a range of negative consequences, including environmental degradation, health risks, and economic inequality.Furthermore, unregulated businesses may also compromise on safety standards, labour rights, and ethical practices in pursuit of higher profits. For instance, they may use cheap and hazardous materials, ignore workplace safety protocols, or exploit their workers to reduce costs and increase margins. Such practices not only harm the environment and society but also undermine the long-term sustainability of the business itself.In conclusion, while making a profit is a legitimate goal for businesses, it should not be their sole objective. Businesses have a responsibility to operate ethically, sustainably, and responsibly, ensuring that their pursuit of profit does not come at the expense of the well-being of humans, animals, and the environment. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Instead, they should strike a balance between profitability and social responsibility.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;The recent announcement of a new high school being built in our neighborhood has sparked a heated debate among residents. As a student, I wholeheartedly support this plan, and I firmly believe that it is a step in the right direction for our community.The current high school in our district is outdated and lacks the necessities that students need to thrive. The infrastructure is old, and the facilities are inadequate, making it difficult for students to focus on their studies. The new high school, on the other hand, will provide a modern and conducive learning environment that will enable students to reach their full potential.Moreover, the new high school will serve as a hub for students from different communities and districts of the city to come together and interact. This will foster new connections, friendships, and a sense of community among students from diverse backgrounds. By bringing together students from different walks of life, the new high school will promote social cohesion, understanding, and empathy. It will also provide opportunities for students to learn from each other's experiences, cultures, and perspectives, broadening their horizons and preparing them for an increasingly globalized world.In addition, the new high school will also provide a range of extracurricular activities and programs that will cater to the diverse interests and talents of students. This will enable students to explore their passions, develop their skills, and discover new interests, ultimately leading to a more well-rounded and fulfilling educational experience.In conclusion, I strongly support the plan to build a new high school in our neighborhood. It will not only provide a modern and conducive learning environment but also serve as a hub for social connection and community building. I believe that this new high school will have a positive impact on our community and will provide students with the opportunities they need to succeed.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;The age-old debate about whether parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older teenage children has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that teenagers should be given complete autonomy, I firmly believe that parents or other adult relatives should indeed make important decisions for their older teenage children, aged 15-18.First and foremost, teenagers, particularly those in this age group, require more attention and guidance in comparison to young adults. During adolescence, individuals are navigating a tumultuous period of physical, emotional, and psychological change. As such, they often lack the maturity and wisdom to make informed decisions that may have long-lasting consequences. Parents and other adult relatives, having experienced similar challenges themselves, are better equipped to provide valuable insights and direction.Moreover, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives possess more experience and knowledge when it comes to making decisions that will impact their children's lives. As they have lived through various experiences and overcome numerous obstacles, they have developed a deeper understanding of the world and its complexities. Consequently, they are the best advisors for their children, able to offer sage counsel and steer them towards making choices that will benefit them in the long run.Additionally, by allowing parents or other adult relatives to make important decisions, teenagers can conserve valuable resources such as time and money. By avoiding costly mistakes and missteps, they can focus on their academic and personal development, ultimately leading to a more successful and fulfilling life. In conclusion, while it is essential to grant teenagers some autonomy, I firmly believe that parents or other adult relatives should play a significant role in making important decisions for their older teenage children. By doing so, they can provide the necessary support and guidance to help them navigate this critical phase of life.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;The statement that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life is a topic of ongoing debate. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people's lives in two main areas.In the first place, children are free to do whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitations are really rare. This sense of freedom allows them to explore the world around them, learn new things, and develop their own interests without any external pressures. Unlike adults, children do not have to worry about meeting deadlines, paying bills, or making a living. They are simply carefree and can enjoy life without any of the burdens that come with growing up.In addition, in this age, they do not have to educate and to work, so they have a lot of time in their hands to enjoy this stage of their life. Children can spend their days playing with friends, reading books, or simply daydreaming without any sense of guilt or responsibility. This lack of responsibility gives them the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in the joys of childhood and to create lifelong memories.Moreover, children's imagination and curiosity are at their peak during this stage, which enables them to see the world from a unique and magical perspective. They are also more open to learning and absorbing new experiences, which adds to their overall sense of wonder and excitement.In conclusion, while happiness can be found at any stage of life, childhood is undoubtedly a time of unparalleled freedom and joy. With its lack of responsibilities, endless curiosity, and carefree spirit, it is no wonder that many people look back on their childhood as the happiest time of their lives.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;Attending college and university has become a vital step for many individuals in pursuit of a successful and fulfilling life. There are numerous reasons why people attend these institutions, and some of the most significant ones include developing their understanding, preparing for their future careers, and gaining hands-on experience.Firstly, university is an ideal place for people to develop their understanding of various subjects and fields of interest. It provides students with a platform to explore and deepen their knowledge, critical thinking, and analytical skills. Through lectures, discussions, and research, students can gain a more profound comprehension of the world around them. For instance, a student majoring in environmental science can develop a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between human activities and the natural world.Secondly, preparing for a career is an essential function of university education.

By providing students with a comprehensive education, practical training, and opportunities for personal growth, universities play a crucial role in shaping the next generation of professionals, thinkers, and leaders.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;In today's world, where social media platforms have made it easier to connect with people from all walks of life, the debate about the ideal number of friends one should have has gained significant attention. While some argue that having a large number of casual acquaintances is beneficial, I firmly believe that it is better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.For me, a friend is not just someone you know or interact with regularly, but a person you genuinely care about. Close friends are those who know you inside out, with whom you can share your deepest thoughts and feelings, and who will be there for you through thick and thin. Having one or two close friends allows for a deeper level of emotional intimacy, trust, and support, which are essential for our emotional and mental well-being.In contrast, casual acquaintances, no matter how many, can never provide the same level of connection and support. While it may be enjoyable to have a large social circle, the relationships are often superficial and lack the depth and meaning that close friendships offer. Furthermore, maintaining a large number of casual relationships can be time-consuming and may lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.In conclusion, while having a large number of casual acquaintances may have its advantages, I firmly believe that it is better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances. Close friends provide a level of emotional support, trust, and intimacy that is essential for our well-being, and are truly worth investing our time and energy in.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";I disagree with the statement that life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when my grandparents were children. While modern technology and advancements have undoubtedly improved many aspects of life, I believe that the simplicity, environment, and pace of life in the past contributed to a more fulfilling and happy existence.In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons. The first reason is that life is simple in the past. Without the burden of modern technology, people had more time to engage in meaningful activities and nurture relationships. In contrast, today's fast-paced world is filled with distractions, leaving people feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from others. In the past, people were more content with what they had, and their simple way of living allowed them to appreciate the small things in life.Second, the environment today is seriously damaged. The air is polluted, the oceans are filled with plastic, and natural resources are being depleted at an alarming rate. In contrast, the environment in the past was pristine and untouched. People lived in harmony with nature, and their connection to the land and wildlife was strong. The beauty and wonder of the natural world brought people joy and a sense of awe, which is often lacking in today's urbanized and industrialized world.Third, the pace of life is another significant factor. In the past, people lived at a slower pace, with time to enjoy the company of others, appreciate the beauty of nature, and engage in leisure activities. Today, people are constantly rushing, with no time to stop and smell the roses. The frantic pace of modern life leads to stress, anxiety, and a sense of burnout, which can be detrimental to mental and physical health.In conclusion, while life today may be easier and more comfortable in some ways, I believe that the simplicity, environmental health, and slower pace of life in the past contributed to a more fulfilling and happy existence.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;As students navigate their high school journey, they are faced with a critical decision that can shape their future careers and areas of specialization. In my opinion, high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several compelling reasons.First and foremost, allowing students to choose their courses provides them with the freedom of choice. High school is a time when students begin to explore their interests and passions, and by giving them the autonomy to select their courses, they can tailor their education to their individual strengths and weaknesses. This freedom of choice enables students to take ownership of their learning and develop a sense of agency, which is essential for their academic and personal growth.Moreover, permitting students to choose their courses can lead to significant progress in their grades and knowledge. When students are interested in the subjects they are studying, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged, leading to better academic performance. By allowing students to choose courses that align with their interests, high schools can foster a love of learning and promote academic excellence.Additionally, allowing students to choose their courses helps them explore their aptitude and discover their strengths and weaknesses. High school is a time of discovery, and by providing students with the opportunity to explore different subjects and courses, they can gain a deeper understanding of their academic and career aspirations. This exploration can help students identify areas where they excel and make informed decisions about their future educational and career paths.In conclusion, high school should permit students to choose courses they want. By doing so, high schools can promote freedom of choice, progress in students' grades and knowledge, and help students explore their aptitude. By giving students the autonomy to select their courses, high schools can empower them to take ownership of their education and make informed decisions about their future careers and areas of specialization.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";When it comes to how people approach their daily lives, two distinct groups emerge: those who are always in a rush and those who prefer a more leisurely pace. While some individuals tend to be in a hurry to complete their tasks, others seem to prefer the opposite position, embracing a slower and more relaxed approach. After deeply pondering over this issue, I have also developed my own perspective on the matter.In my opinion, I prefer to be someone who is always in a hurry to go places and get things done. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks. In today's fast-paced world, time is a precious commodity, and being in a hurry allows me to make the most of it. By prioritizing tasks and managing my time effectively, I can complete multiple tasks efficiently, leaving me with more time to focus on other aspects of my life. For instance, during my university days, I had to balance my academic responsibilities with part-time work and extracurricular activities. By being in a hurry and staying focused, I was able to complete my assignments on time, perform well in my job, and still make time for leisure activities.Another equally important aspect is that keeping in a high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. When I am always on the move, I stay motivated and energized, which helps me to stay on track with my goals and aspirations. For example, when I am working on a project, I make sure to set deadlines for myself and work towards meeting them. This helps me to avoid procrastination and stay focused on the task at hand. Moreover, being in a hurry also helps me to develop my time management skills, which are essential in today's competitive world.In conclusion, while some people may prefer a slower pace, I firmly believe that being in a hurry has its own set of benefits. By prioritizing tasks, managing my time effectively, and staying motivated, I can achieve more in less time, which is essential for success in today's fast-paced world.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;The tourism industry is a multibillion-dollar sector that plays a pivotal role in supporting economic development across the globe. It has the potential to vastly boost economic growth in a particular state or region, providing a myriad of benefits to the local community. One of the most significant advantages of tourism is its ability to create jobs, both directly and indirectly. From retail and hospitality to transportation and agriculture, the service industry is also a major beneficiary. The influx of tourists leads to an increased demand for goods and services, thereby stimulating local economies.On the other hand, some people may oppose the development of tourism, citing the environmental and cultural destruction it can cause. Over-tourism, for instance, can result in the degradation of natural habitats, pollution, and strain on local infrastructure. Moreover, the cultural heritage of a region can be compromised as tourists often bring with them their own customs and values, which can lead to the erosion of traditional practices and ways of life.However, I believe that tourism can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can bring about unprecedented economic benefits. On the other, it can also lead to environmental degradation and cultural disruption. But, with careful planning, management, and regulation, the negative impacts of tourism can be mitigated. Governments and local authorities can implement sustainable tourism practices, such as eco-tourism and cultural tourism, which prioritize the preservation of natural and cultural heritage.Furthermore, tourism can also serve as a catalyst for conservation efforts. By promoting the natural beauty and cultural significance of a region, tourism can raise awareness and funds for conservation initiatives. In conclusion, while tourism can have its downsides, its benefits to economic development, job creation, and cultural exchange far outweigh the costs.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in society has sparked a heated debate. Some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is a waste of national resources and that the money should instead be spent on public services. However, I contend that this investment in the field of the arts would be in the best interest of society.While it is true that public services are essential for the well-being and safety of citizens, I believe that the arts play a vital role in shaping the culture, identity, and values of a nation. The arts have the power to inspire, educate, and unite people, fostering a sense of community and social cohesion. Moreover, the arts contribute significantly to the economy, generating revenue through tourism, cultural events, and the sale of artistic products.Furthermore, investing in the arts can have numerous benefits for individuals and society as a whole. It can improve mental health, cognitive skills, and academic performance, particularly in children. The arts can also promote creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, driving progress and growth in various industries.Moreover, the arts are often a reflection of a society's history, struggles, and values. By supporting the arts, we are preserving our cultural heritage and promoting diversity and inclusivity. Cutting funding to the arts would not only harm the artists and art institutions but also deprive future generations of the opportunity to engage with and learn from their cultural heritage.In conclusion, while public services are essential, I firmly believe that investing in the arts is equally important. The arts have the power to transform, inspire, and unite people, contributing to the overall well-being and prosperity of a society. Rather than viewing the arts as a waste of national resources, we should recognize their value and continue to allocate funds to support and nurture artistic expression.
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";"The traditional notion of having a single career has become outdated in today's fast-paced, ever-evolving world. The emerging trend is to have multiple careers or sources of income, and ongoing education is becoming a lifelong pursuit. This shift is particularly evident among new generations, who are more inclined to diversify their professional lives and pursue multiple higher educational certifications.In the past, a full-time job with a steady income was sufficient for an individual to support themselves and their family. However, the recent recession has led to a significant economic downturn globally, making it increasingly challenging for people to rely on a single source of income. As a result, individuals are now seeking alternative ways to earn a living and ensure financial security.The younger generation, in particular, is driving this change. They are more open to exploring different career paths and are eager to acquire multiple higher educational certificates to increase their earning potential. This approach not only provides a safety net but also allows individuals to pursue their passions and interests in a more flexible and dynamic manner.In response to these changing times, the concept of education is also undergoing a transformation. Gone are the days of pursuing a single degree and considering oneself ""educated"" for life. Instead, education is becoming a continuous process, with individuals seeking to upskill and reskill throughout their lives to remain relevant in the job market. This shift towards lifelong learning is not only necessary but also essential for individuals to stay adaptable and competitive in today's fast-paced economy.In conclusion, the notion of having a single career is becoming a relic of the past. The future belongs to those who are willing to diversify their income streams, pursue multiple educational certifications, and commit to ongoing learning. As the job market continues to evolve, it is clear that this new approach will become the norm, and those who adapt will be better equipped to thrive in an increasingly uncertain world."
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;The role of computers in today's society has sparked a heated debate among individuals. On one hand, many people argue that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in social life. They believe that the over-reliance on technology has led to social isolation, decreased face-to-face interaction, and a decline in deep, meaningful relationships. Moreover, the constant stream of information and notifications can be overwhelming, causing distractions and decreasing productivity. For instance, the rise of social media has been linked to increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.However, I strongly believe that computers have a profoundly positive influence on society, and people's lives have already been controlled by devices in many ways. Computers have revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and conduct business. The internet has enabled instant connectivity with people across the globe, fostering global communication, collaboration, and understanding. Furthermore, computers have democratized access to information, allowing people to learn new skills, expand their knowledge, and make informed decisions.In addition, computers have transformed the way we work, making it possible to work remotely, increasing flexibility, and improving work-life balance. Many industries, such as healthcare, finance, and education, rely heavily on computers to function efficiently. Computers have also enabled advancements in fields like medicine, engineering, and space exploration, leading to breakthroughs and innovations that have improved the human condition.While it is true that computers can be a hindrance if not used responsibly, I firmly believe that their benefits far outweigh their drawbacks. As we move forward, it is essential to strike a balance between technology use and social interaction, ensuring that computers remain a tool that enhances our lives rather than controls them. By embracing the positive aspects of computers and mitigating their negative effects, we can harness their full potential to create a better, more connected world.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;The importance of qualifications versus social skills in the job market has been a long-standing debate among employers. While some employers are increasingly looking beyond qualifications and emphasizing social skills in their hiring process, others still believe that qualifications should be the top priority. In this essay, we will explore both viewpoints and present an opinion on the matter.On the one hand, there is a growing number of employers who seek criteria other than qualifications, such as social skills, in their employee selection process. These employers recognize that social skills, such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, are essential for success in the workplace. They argue that while qualifications may demonstrate a candidate's technical expertise, social skills are crucial for effective collaboration, adaptability, and customer service. In today's fast-paced and interconnected work environment, the ability to work harmoniously with colleagues, manage conflicts, and interact with clients is just as important as technical knowledge. By prioritizing social skills, these employers aim to create a cohesive and productive team that can drive business success.On the other hand, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. They argue that qualifications demonstrate a candidate's level of expertise, knowledge, and commitment to their field. Without proper qualifications, an employee may lack the necessary foundation to perform their job duties effectively. Moreover, qualifications provide a standardized measure of a candidate's abilities, allowing employers to compare candidates fairly. In fields like law, medicine, and engineering, where precision and accuracy are critical, qualifications are indeed crucial.In my opinion, both qualifications and social skills are essential for success in the workplace. While qualifications provide a foundation of knowledge and expertise, social skills are vital for effective collaboration and communication. Employers should strike a balance between the two, considering both qualifications and social skills in their hiring process. By doing so, they can create a well-rounded team that excels in both technical expertise and interpersonal skills. Ultimately, this balanced approach will lead to greater productivity, job satisfaction, and business success.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;The debate about whether charities should focus on aiding those in need within their own country or globally has sparked intense discussion. While some people argue that charity organisations should prioritise helping those in their own countries, others believe that aid should be given to those who need it most, regardless of their location. In this essay, we will explore both perspectives and provide an opinion on the matter.On the one hand, it is undeniable that international aid is critical in addressing severe humanitarian crises worldwide. People in certain African countries, for instance, are living below the basic standards, struggling to access fundamental necessities like clean water, food, and healthcare. In such cases, charities have a moral obligation to provide assistance, as these individuals are often facing life-threatening situations. By extending aid globally, charities can help alleviate suffering, promote development, and save lives.On the other hand, it is reasonable to argue that charity organisations should lend a hand to their fellow citizens first. Many people within a country may be struggling with poverty, homelessness, or other social issues that require attention and support. By focusing on domestic aid, charities can address pressing local concerns, foster a sense of community, and promote social cohesion. Moreover, helping those in need within one's own country can also have a more direct and tangible impact, as charities are more familiar with the local context and can better tailor their assistance to the specific needs of their compatriots.In my opinion, a balanced approach is necessary. Charities should strive to address both global and domestic needs, allocating resources according to the severity of the crises and the potential impact of their aid. By doing so, charities can make a meaningful difference in the lives of those who need it most, both at home and abroad. Ultimately, the moral imperative to help those in need knows no borders, and charities should endeavour to be guided by a sense of global citizenship and compassion.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, primarily due to the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology. This has led to a debate on the effectiveness of traditional teaching methods versus alternative sources such as the internet and television. In my opinion, I disagree with the notion that students learn far more from lessons with teachers than from other sources. Instead, I believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.On one hand, traditional teaching methods have been the cornerstone of education for centuries. Teachers provide personalized attention, guidance, and support that is crucial for students' academic and emotional development. They also create a structured learning environment that helps students stay focused and motivated. However, with the rise of modern technology, students now have access to a vast array of educational resources online, including video lectures, online courses, and educational websites. These resources can supplement traditional teaching methods and provide students with a more comprehensive understanding of complex subjects.On the other hand, alternative sources such as the internet and television offer a unique set of benefits that traditional teaching methods cannot provide. For instance, online resources can be accessed from anywhere and at any time, making it easier for students to learn at their own pace. Additionally, educational television programs and documentaries can provide students with a visually engaging and interactive learning experience that can be more effective than traditional teaching methods in certain subjects.In conclusion, while traditional teaching methods will always be essential, I firmly believe that alternative sources such as the internet and television also play a vital role in children's acquisition of knowledge. A balanced approach that combines both traditional teaching methods and alternative sources is necessary to provide students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for success in the 21st century.
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";The notion that popular international sporting events, such as the football World Cup, play a significant role in easing international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions, is a widely debated topic. While some argue that these events bring nations together and foster a sense of unity, others contend that they are merely a form of entertainment designed to distract people from pressing global issues. In this essay, we will examine both perspectives and assess the extent to which international sporting events can be seen as a catalyst for easing international tensions.On one hand, international sporting events like the World Cup have the unique ability to bring almost every country around the world together, creating a shared experience that transcends national borders. These events provide a social stimulus, encouraging people to gather and interact with one another, often in large public spaces. This collective enthusiasm can help to release patriotic emotions in a safe and controlled manner, thereby reducing the risk of inter-state conflict. Furthermore, the Olympic truce, a tradition that dates back to ancient Greece, demonstrates the potential for international sporting events to promote peace and understanding among nations.On the other hand, some argue that international sporting events are merely a form of entertainment designed to distract people from pressing global issues, such as poverty, inequality, and conflict. From this perspective, the focus on sport is seen as a way to divert attention away from the complexities of international relations and the need for meaningful dialogue and cooperation. Critics also point out that the nationalism and tribalism that often accompany these events can actually exacerbate tensions and reinforce existing divisions.In conclusion, while international sporting events like the World Cup do have the potential to ease international tensions and provide a safe outlet for patriotic emotions, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this impact. Ultimately, these events should be seen as a supplement to, rather than a substitute for, meaningful international cooperation and diplomacy. By recognizing both the benefits and limitations of international sporting events, we can harness their potential to promote greater understanding and cooperation among nations.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;The rise of distance-learning programmes has revolutionised the way people access education, offering flexibility and convenience to students worldwide. Despite its benefits, some argue that distance learning cannot replace the traditional college or university experience. However, I firmly believe that distance learning can be just as effective, if not more so, than attending a physical institution.One of the primary advantages of distance learning is the significant cost savings it offers. Students can cut down on commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees, and other expenses associated with attending a physical college or university. With just an internet connection, students can access a wealth of study materials, online resources, and virtual classrooms. This accessibility is particularly beneficial for those who live in remote areas or have busy schedules that make it difficult to attend traditional classes.Moreover, long-distance education provides students with the opportunity to access immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Online courses and degree programmes are often designed by experts in their fields, offering students a chance to learn from the best. Additionally, online resources such as e-books, webinars, and online tutorials can cater to different learning styles, making education more inclusive and effective.Furthermore, distance learning promotes self-discipline and time management skills, as students need to stay motivated and organised to keep up with their coursework. This independence can be beneficial for students who prefer to work at their own pace, away from the distractions and pressures of a traditional classroom environment.In conclusion, while some may argue that distance learning cannot replace the traditional college experience, I firmly believe that it offers numerous benefits that can enhance the learning experience. With the right mindset and resources, students can thrive in a distance-learning environment, achieving their academic goals without the need for a physical campus.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;The extinction of species has been a pressing issue in recent years, with many animal protectionists advocating for the conservation of these species. On the other hand, some individuals argue that human problems should take precedence over animal conservation. In this essay, we will discuss both perspectives and provide a personal viewpoint.On one hand, animal protectionists base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. According to this view, the extinction of a single species can have a ripple effect throughout the entire ecosystem, leading to unpredictable and potentially disastrous consequences. For instance, the loss of a key pollinator species can lead to the decline of plant species that rely on it, ultimately affecting human food security. Therefore, protecting these animals from dying out is crucial to maintaining the delicate balance of our ecosystem.On the other hand, others argue that extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being, and many species have gone extinct as a result of these changes. From this perspective, human efforts to prevent extinction are futile, as it is a natural process that has been occurring for millions of years.In my opinion, while it is true that extinction is a natural process, human activities have accelerated the rate of extinction to an unprecedented level. The current rate of extinction is estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times higher than the natural rate, with many species facing extinction due to human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. Therefore, I believe that we should take action to protect these animals from dying out, not only to maintain the balance of ecosystem but also to preserve the natural beauty and diversity of our planet.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;The notion of accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject at universities has sparked a heated debate in recent years. In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future, making it imperative that opportunities are available to all, regardless of gender. In my personal opinion, I strongly agree that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university course.There appear to be various reasons that strike my mind in support of this position. Firstly, promoting gender equality is essential in breaking down societal barriers and stereotypes that have long hindered women's progress in certain fields. By accepting equal numbers of male and female students, universities can foster a culture of inclusivity, allowing both genders to contribute equally to discussions and share their perspectives. This, in turn, can lead to a more holistic understanding of the subject matter and a more diverse range of ideas.Furthermore, equal representation can also address the issue of underrepresentation of women in certain fields, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). By providing equal opportunities, universities can encourage more women to pursue careers in these fields, ultimately leading to a more balanced workforce. Additionally, accepting equal numbers of male and female students can also promote healthy competition and collaboration, leading to better academic outcomes and a more enriching learning experience.However, some may argue that accepting equal numbers of male and female students could lead to a quota system, which might compromise the quality of students. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that this concern can be addressed through a fair and transparent admission process that prioritizes merit while ensuring equal opportunities for both genders.In conclusion, I firmly believe that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. By doing so, they can promote gender equality, break down societal barriers, and provide equal opportunities for all students to succeed.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;The significant advancement in medical care has led to a substantial increase in life expectancy worldwide. Improved medical care has played a crucial role in this development, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives. While some may argue that the disadvantages of this trend outweigh the advantages, I firmly believe that the benefits of increased life expectancy far surpass the drawbacks.One of the primary advantages of advanced medical care is that people receive better treatment, resulting in improved health outcomes. High-tech medical care has made it possible to diagnose and treat diseases more effectively, leading to a significant reduction in mortality rates. This, in turn, has enabled people to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives. A community with a sizable population of healthy elderly individuals has a vital role to play in the sustainable development of society. Older adults can continue to contribute to their communities, sharing their experience, wisdom, and skills with younger generations. This not only enriches the social fabric of society but also helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems and social services.Moreover, a longer-living population can also have positive economic impacts. Older workers can continue to contribute to the workforce, filling labor gaps and paying taxes that support social security systems. Additionally, healthy elderly individuals can also participate in volunteering, mentoring, and other community activities, fostering social cohesion and community development.In conclusion, while there may be some disadvantages associated with increased life expectancy, such as potential strain on healthcare and social security systems, the advantages far outweigh the drawbacks. Advanced medical care has played a significant role in improving life expectancy, and the benefits of a healthier, longer-living population are numerous. As our society continues to evolve, it is essential that we prioritize healthcare and social support systems that enable older adults to live healthy, productive, and fulfilling lives.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;The purpose of education has always been a controversial topic among people and society. While some believe that a college or university education should be available to all students, others argue that it should be reserved for good students. In my opinion, it is better to leave this type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.The primary reason for this is that focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. When universities accept students based solely on academic merit, they can ensure that their students are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in their chosen fields. This, in turn, allows institutions to uphold their standards and reputation for excellence.Moreover, university education is not just about imparting knowledge, but also about producing human resources that can contribute to sophisticated purposes such as scientific research, innovation, and leadership. Therefore, it is essential that only good students are accepted into these institutions. By doing so, universities can provide the necessary training and nurturing to these talented individuals, enabling them to make meaningful contributions to society.Furthermore, accepting only good students allows universities to allocate their resources more efficiently. By focusing on students who have demonstrated academic prowess, institutions can provide them with the necessary support and guidance to help them reach their full potential. This, in turn, can lead to breakthroughs and advancements in various fields, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.In conclusion, while the idea of making university education available to all students may seem appealing, I firmly believe that it is better to reserve this privilege for good students. By doing so, academic institutions can maintain their high standards, produce better human resources, and contribute to the betterment of society.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The age-old debate about how universities should allocate their resources has sparked intense discussion among educators and students alike. While some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in hiring famous teachers, others seem to believe that improving facilities is the way to go. After careful consideration of both sides, I firmly believe that universities spend their money more effectively by improving facilities, rather than hiring famous teachers.On the one hand, proponents of hiring famous teachers argue that they can bring prestige and recognition to the university, attracting more students and enhancing the institution's reputation. Famous teachers can also provide students with valuable connections and networking opportunities. However, I would counter that these benefits are largely intangible and short-term. Moreover, the cost of hiring and retaining famous teachers can be prohibitively expensive, diverting resources away from other essential areas of university life.On the other hand, investing in improving facilities offers a multitude of benefits that far outweigh the advantages of hiring famous teachers. State-of-the-art laboratories, libraries, and recreational facilities can provide students with hands-on learning experiences, enhance their research capabilities, and promote a healthy work-life balance. Moreover, modern facilities can also contribute to a safer and more comfortable learning environment, which is essential for students' overall well-being and academic success. Furthermore, improved facilities can also benefit the university in the long run, as they can attract more students and faculty, and enhance the institution's reputation in a more sustainable way.In conclusion, while hiring famous teachers may have some benefits, I firmly believe that improving facilities is the best way for universities to spend their money. The advantages of this approach, including enhanced learning experiences, improved research capabilities, and a better quality of life, far outweigh the benefits of hiring famous teachers. By prioritizing facility improvement, universities can create a more supportive and conducive learning environment that benefits students, faculty, and the institution as a whole.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;High schools play a crucial role in shaping the educational and professional trajectory of students. A contentious issue that has garnered significant attention in recent years is whether high schools should allow students to study the courses of their choice. In my opinion, high schools should indeed grant students the autonomy to select their desired courses, albeit with some caveats.On one hand, it is essential for students to find one or more fields of study that genuinely captivate their interests. When students are passionate about a particular subject, they tend to excel in it and develop a deeper understanding of the material. By allowing students to pursue their desired courses, high schools can foster a love for learning, increase student motivation, and ultimately, lead to better academic outcomes. For instance, a student who is enthusiastic about mathematics may choose to take advanced courses in calculus, statistics, and computer science, laying a strong foundation for a future career in data science or engineering.On the other hand, it is equally important for students to explore a broad range of subjects before deciding on their future major. High schools should ensure that students are exposed to various disciplines, enabling them to discover their strengths and weaknesses. This exploratory phase is vital in preventing students from prematurely specializing in a field that may not align with their aptitudes or interests. By providing students with a well-rounded education, high schools can help them make informed decisions about their academic and professional pursuits.However, it is also crucial to acknowledge that tertiary education is designed to prepare students for specialization at the university level. High schools should, therefore, strike a balance between allowing students to pursue their interests and providing them with a comprehensive education that prepares them for the rigors of specialized study. By doing so, high schools can equip students with the necessary skills, knowledge, and adaptability to succeed in their chosen fields, while also nurturing their passions and interests.In conclusion, high schools should indeed allow students to study the courses they desire, but with a nuanced approach that balances student autonomy with the need for a well-rounded education and preparation for specialization. By adopting this approach, high schools can empower students to make informed decisions about their academic and professional futures, ultimately leading to greater success and fulfillment.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;The notion that games are as important for adults as they are for children has garnered significant attention in recent years. While some people think that adults need playing games as children do, I strongly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, games are no longer too important for adults for several reasons.First and foremost, the pressure of work and family commitments forces adults to abandon their lifelong hobbies, including playing games. As people grow older, their priorities shift, and responsibilities such as career advancement, family, and financial stability take precedence over leisure activities. Adults often have to juggle multiple roles, leaving little time or energy for gaming. Furthermore, the demands of modern life can be overwhelming, making it difficult for adults to find the mental and emotional space to engage in gaming activities.Another reason why games are less important for adults is that they serve different purposes. For children, games are essential for cognitive development, socialization, and emotional growth. They provide a platform for kids to learn, explore, and express themselves. In contrast, adults have already developed these skills, and their needs are different. While some adults may enjoy gaming as a form of relaxation or socialization, it is no longer a crucial aspect of their development.Additionally, the consequences of excessive gaming can be more severe for adults than for children. Adults who spend too much time playing games may neglect their work, family, and health responsibilities, leading to negative outcomes such as job loss, relationship problems, and decreased physical and mental well-being.In conclusion, while some people may argue that games are equally important for adults and children, I firmly believe that this is not the case. The pressures of adult life, the different purposes of gaming, and the potential consequences of excessive gaming all support the notion that games are no longer as important for adults as they are for children.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";"The advent of modern technology has revolutionized the way people communicate, interact, and live their lives. The statement ""Modern technology is creating a single world culture"" is a topic of debate among scholars and experts. In my opinion, I agree with this statement, and here's why.New technology has indeed affected cultures of the world, bringing them closer together and creating a sense of homogenization. We can see many similarities in cultures that were previously distinct and unique. For instance, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or give a presentation compared to Canadian students. This is not an isolated example, as people from different cultures are using the same social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, to connect with each other and share their experiences.A single modern culture is being created by modern technology for several reasons. Firstly, the internet has made it possible for people to access information and ideas from all over the world, creating a shared knowledge base that transcends geographical boundaries. Secondly, social media has enabled people to connect with each other and form global communities that are not limited by cultural or national identities. Finally, modern technology has created a global market place where people can buy and sell goods and services, creating a shared consumer culture.For example, the rise of e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba has created a global market place where people can buy goods and services from all over the world. Similarly, the spread of fast food chains such as McDonald's and KFC has created a global food culture that is recognized and consumed by people from different cultures.In conclusion, modern technology is indeed creating a single world culture. The similarities in cultures that were previously distinct and unique are a testament to this fact. As technology continues to advance and spread, we can expect to see even more similarities in cultures and a further homogenization of the world culture."
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;The idea that family support is crucial in achieving success has gained significant attention in recent years. Some people believe that nowadays, the assistance from family is quite an essential factor in one's success. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement, as family plays a more important role in helping one to pursue success. There are a couple of reasons that justify this stance.Firstly, the financial support provided by family has become a vital aspect in pursuing one's goals. With the rising costs of education, career development, and starting a business, it has become increasingly difficult for individuals to rely solely on their own resources. Family support can provide the necessary financial backing, enabling individuals to take risks and invest in their future. For instance, many successful entrepreneurs have attributed their success to the initial financial support they received from their family, which allowed them to launch their businesses and navigate the initial challenges.Secondly, emotional support from family can also play a significant role in achieving success. The encouragement, guidance, and motivation provided by family members can help individuals stay focused and driven, even in the face of adversity. Having a supportive family can also provide a sense of security and stability, allowing individuals to take calculated risks and pursue their passions without fear of failure. This emotional support can be particularly crucial during times of uncertainty or self-doubt, helping individuals to stay committed to their goals and overcome obstacles.In conclusion, I firmly believe that family support is a crucial factor in achieving success in today's world. The financial and emotional backing provided by family can make all the difference in helping individuals pursue their goals and overcome challenges. As such, I strongly agree that nowadays, it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than it was before.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";"The age-old debate between reading fiction and watching movies has sparked intense discussions among book lovers and film enthusiasts alike. While some argue that the thrill of the big screen cannot be replicated, I firmly believe that reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies. Two primary reasons that substantiate my stance are the attention to detail in fiction books and the convenience of reading a novel.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details, allowing readers to immerse themselves in the narrative more thoroughly. Novels and short stories provide an in-depth exploration of characters' thoughts, emotions, and backstories, which are often glossed over in movie adaptations. For instance, J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is renowned for its intricate world-building and character development, making it a more engaging read than the film versions. The level of detail in fiction books enables readers to form a deeper connection with the story, fostering a more enjoyable reading experience.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient than watching a movie. Many novels, such as novellas, have around 100 pages, making them easy to finish in a few sittings. In contrast, movies typically require a significant time commitment, often lasting over an hour. For individuals with busy schedules, like students, finding a two-hour block to watch a movie can be challenging. In my own experience, I often find myself with only 15-minute windows of free time, which is insufficient for watching a complete movie. However, I can easily pick up a book and read a chapter or two during these brief intervals, making reading a more flexible and enjoyable option.In conclusion, the attention to detail in fiction books and the convenience of reading a novel make reading fiction a more enjoyable experience than watching movies. While films have their own unique charms, the immersive and flexible nature of reading fiction makes it the superior choice for those seeking a more engaging and convenient form of entertainment."
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";"The decline of languages has sparked a debate on whether a world with fewer languages promotes harmony and understanding among people. While some argue that it's a positive trend, others strongly disagree. In this essay, we will analyze both sides of the argument and provide an opinion on the matter.On the one hand, some people argue that the decline of languages is a positive change that is helping the world become a better place to live. They believe that having a single language used throughout the world will simplify communication and reduce barriers between people. For instance, travelers will no longer struggle with daily activities such as ordering food in a restaurant or navigating unfamiliar places. With a single language, misunderstandings between people will decrease, and interactions will become more efficient. This, in turn, will promote harmony and understanding among people from different cultures and backgrounds.On the other hand, others argue that the decline of languages is a loss of cultural diversity and heritage. Languages are not just a means of communication; they are also a part of a community's identity and history. When a language disappears, a part of the community's culture and traditions is lost forever. Moreover, languages are not just a tool for communication; they also shape the way people think and perceive the world. A world with fewer languages may be more efficient, but it will also be less rich and diverse.In my opinion, while having a single language may simplify communication and reduce misunderstandings, it is not worth the cost of losing cultural diversity and heritage. Languages are an essential part of human identity and culture, and their loss is irreparable. Moreover, technology has made it easier for people to communicate across languages, reducing the need for a single language. Therefore, I believe that preserving linguistic diversity is essential for promoting harmony and understanding among people, rather than reducing the number of languages."
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;The notion that elderly people believe their past experiences were simpler and better than the present day is a common sentiment shared by many. However, I disagree with this assertion. While it is true that the past had its charm and simplicity, the rapid advancements in technology and medical science have significantly improved our lives.We live in an era where technology is developing at an unprecedented rate, steering the world towards a more convenient place. With the rise of the internet, smartphones, and social media, people can now access information, connect with others, and perform various tasks with ease. For instance, online shopping has revolutionized the way we shop, allowing people to purchase goods and services from the comfort of their own homes. This convenience was unimaginable in the past, where people had to physically visit stores to make purchases.Moreover, the phenomenal progress in medical science over the last decade has been a huge achievement for humanity. Advances in medical research and technology have led to the development of new treatments, medications, and vaccines, making the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. For example, the development of vaccines against diseases such as COVID-19, HPV, and influenza has saved countless lives and improved the quality of life for many. In contrast, in the past, people had limited access to healthcare, and many diseases were incurable.While it is natural for elderly people to nostalgically reminisce about their past experiences, I believe that the advancements in technology and medical science have greatly improved our lives. These developments have not only increased our convenience and accessibility but also significantly improved our health and well-being. Therefore, I disagree with the notion that the past was simpler and better than the present day.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;The idea of teaching financial management to secondary and higher school students has sparked intense debate among educators, policymakers, and parents. Some individuals strongly believe that imparting money management skills to juveniles may have unintended consequences, while others, like myself, firmly agree that higher school students should be equipped with this essential life skill.On one hand, there are valid concerns that introducing financial management to young minds may lead to an excessive focus on material wealth, potentially harming their innocence and creativity. Some argue that exposure to complex financial concepts at a tender age may lead to undue stress, causing students to prioritize wealth accumulation over other vital aspects of their development.On the other hand, I firmly believe that teaching financial management to higher school students is crucial for their future success. As they transition into adulthood, they will inevitably encounter financial decisions that will significantly impact their lives. By learning how to manage money effectively, students will develop a critical life skill that will benefit them in numerous ways. They will be better equipped to make informed decisions about budgeting, saving, and investing, ultimately leading to greater financial stability and security.Moreover, incorporating financial education into school curricula can also promote responsible spending habits, debt management, and entrepreneurship. By teaching students how to navigate the complexities of personal finance, we can empower them to make wise choices and avoid common financial pitfalls.In conclusion, while concerns about introducing financial management to young students are valid, I strongly agree that higher school students should be taught this essential life skill. By doing so, we can equip them with the knowledge and expertise necessary to thrive in an increasingly complex financial world, ultimately leading to greater financial stability, security, and success.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;I strongly agree with the statement that smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. There are several compelling reasons that support this stance.First and foremost, smoking in restaurants can be a significant nuisance to non-smokers. When smokers light up in an enclosed space, the smoke can spread quickly, making it difficult for others to breathe comfortably. This can be especially problematic for people with pre-existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma. Restaurants are places where people come to enjoy their meals, and the presence of cigarette smoke can be a major distraction from the dining experience.Moreover, smoking in restaurants can set a bad example for vulnerable populations, such as children, grandparents, and pregnant women. Children, in particular, are impressionable and may view smoking as a normal and acceptable behavior if they see adults smoking in public places. Grandparents may be exposed to second-hand smoke, which can exacerbate age-related health issues, while pregnant women may be putting their unborn babies at risk of health complications.Another critical consideration is the impact of second-hand smoke on passive smokers. Research has shown that passive smokers are exposed to the same health risks as active smokers, including lung cancer, heart disease, and other respiratory problems. It is unfair to subject non-smokers to these risks, especially when they have not chosen to smoke themselves.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. The negative impacts of second-hand smoke on non-smokers, vulnerable populations, and the overall dining experience make it essential to maintain smoke-free environments in restaurants. By upholding these laws, we can promote a healthier and more considerate environment for everyone.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;The Influence of Violent Films on Youngsters: A Negative ImpactIn recent years, the depiction of violence in films has increased exponentially, with many movies relying on intense action sequences and graphic content to captivate audiences. This trend has raised concerns among parents, educators, and mental health professionals, who argue that the growing violence in films has a negative impact on youngsters. From my perspective, I strongly agree with this statement, as the exposure to violent films can have detrimental effects on the behavior, emotions, and academic performance of young viewers.Over the past two decades, the film industry has witnessed a significant surge in violent content, with many movies incorporating gruesome and disturbing scenes to attract larger audiences. This shift in cinematic content has been exploited as a marketing strategy, with filmmakers using violence as a means to advertise their films and generate buzz. However, this approach has led to a desensitization of audiences, particularly youngsters, to the consequences of violence.The impact of violent films on youngsters is multifaceted. Firstly, exposure to violent content can lead to aggressive behavior, as children may imitate the actions they witness on screen. This can result in increased bullying, fighting, and other forms of antisocial behavior. Secondly, violent films can have a profound impact on the emotional well-being of youngsters, causing anxiety, fear, and stress. Finally, the constant exposure to violent content can distract youngsters from their academic pursuits, leading to decreased attention span, lower grades, and reduced interest in learning.In conclusion, the growing violence in films has indeed had a negative impact on youngsters. It is essential for parents, educators, and filmmakers to be aware of this issue and take steps to mitigate its effects. By promoting responsible filmmaking practices and encouraging critical thinking in young viewers, we can reduce the negative influence of violent films and foster a more positive and empathetic generation of youngsters.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";"In today's information age, staying well-informed is crucial for making informed decisions and being an active participant in society. The notion that ""information is power"" holds significant weight, emphasizing the importance of being knowledgeable about current events and issues. In this context, I strongly agree that to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.One of the primary reasons for seeking information from diverse sources is to ensure the reliability of the information. When news is reported by a single source, there is a risk of bias or inaccuracy. By consulting multiple sources, individuals can verify the accuracy of the information and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issue. This is particularly important when it comes to factual reporting, where knowing the facts about an event or problem is essential, rather than relying on estimations or assumptions.Furthermore, different news sources often provide unique perspectives and insights, allowing readers to gain a more nuanced understanding of the issue at hand. For instance, a news article in a local newspaper may provide a more detailed account of a local event, while a national news outlet may offer a broader perspective on the issue. By consulting multiple sources, individuals can gain a more complete picture of the situation, rather than relying on a single, potentially limited, viewpoint.In conclusion, being well-informed is crucial in today's society, and to achieve this, it is essential to seek information from many different news sources. By doing so, individuals can guarantee the reliability of the information, gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issue, and stay informed about current events and issues."
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;The debate surrounding the preservation of old buildings in urban areas has been a longstanding one. On one hand, some argue that these structures occupy valuable land that could be utilized for modern development, providing much-needed housing and infrastructure for a growing population. They contend that the cost of maintaining and restoring old buildings is often prohibitively expensive, and that resources would be better allocated towards creating new, more functional spaces.On the other hand, there are those who firmly believe that old buildings are an integral part of our cultural heritage, and that their preservation is essential for maintaining a sense of history and identity. These individuals argue that the cultural significance of these structures far outweighs their practical value, and that they provide a tangible link to our past.In my opinion, all old buildings that contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved. These structures are a window into our collective past, offering a glimpse into the lives of those who came before us. By preserving them, we can learn from our mistakes, appreciate our progress, and gain a deeper understanding of who we are as a society. Moreover, these buildings often serve as tourist attractions, generating revenue and promoting cultural exchange.Governments are often faced with the difficult task of balancing the needs of their citizens with the desire to protect our cultural heritage. However, I firmly believe that the preservation of old buildings is essential for maintaining a sense of national identity and community. While it is true that the cost of preservation can be high, I believe that the long-term benefits far outweigh the expenses. By preserving our cultural heritage, we can create a sense of continuity and shared history, which is essential for building strong, cohesive communities.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;The widespread use of mobile phones among young people has become a ubiquitous phenomenon in today's society. Many young individuals consider their mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives, relying on it for various aspects of their daily life, from communication and information to entertainment and socialization. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.Firstly, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. For instance, I have noticed that many of my classmates are often caught texting or browsing through social media during lectures, which hinders their ability to focus on the lesson and absorb the information being taught. This distraction can lead to poor academic performance, which can have long-term consequences on their future prospects.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. The constant exposure to advertisements and social media platforms showcasing the latest gadgets and trendy products can create a sense of desire and dissatisfaction with their current possessions. I have seen many of my friends, who are barely teenagers, already flaunting their latest smartphones and bragging about their expensive accessories. This obsession with material possessions can lead to an unhealthy sense of self-worth and a distorted view of what is truly important in life.In conclusion, while mobile phones have undoubtedly made life easier and more convenient for young people, their popularity among this age group is a bad development. The distractions and materialistic tendencies they promote can have serious negative impacts on their academic and personal growth. It is essential for young people to maintain a balance between their mobile phone use and other aspects of their life to avoid these pitfalls.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";The debate surrounding fixed punishments for crimes has garnered significant attention, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. While some believe that a one-size-fits-all approach to punishment is the most effective way to maintain law and order, others contend that the unique circumstances and motivations behind each crime must be considered.On one hand, implementing fixed punishments for each type of crime may seem like an efficient solution. It would undoubtedly reduce the time taken by judges to deliver judgments, as the sentence would be predetermined. This, in turn, would be economically beneficial for the government, as it would save time and resources. However, this approach has a significant flaw. Professional criminals, aware of the fixed punishment, would be more likely to commit crimes, as they would know exactly what to expect in terms of consequences. This could lead to an increase in crime rates, as individuals would be more willing to take risks knowing the exact punishment they would face.On the other hand, considering the circumstances and motivations behind each crime allows for a more nuanced approach to justice. While this may require more time and effort from judges, it ensures that each individual is held accountable for their actions in a way that is fair and proportionate to their crime. This approach also acknowledges that each crime is unique and that a one-size-fits-all solution may not always be the most effective way to address the underlying issues that led to the crime.In conclusion, while fixed punishments may seem like a straightforward solution, they have the potential to increase crime rates among professional criminals. A more balanced approach, taking into account the circumstances and motivations behind each crime, is necessary to ensure that justice is served in a fair and effective manner.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap air travel has sparked a contentious debate about its impact on society and the environment. On one hand, proponents of affordable air travel argue that it has democratized travel, enabling ordinary people to explore distant destinations that were previously inaccessible. This is particularly true for the lower-income group, who can now enjoy the freedom to travel further, broadening their cultural and social horizons.However, critics of cheap air travel contend that the environmental costs far outweigh the benefits. The proliferation of flights has led to the construction of bigger and busier airports, resulting in increased air pollution that affects people living and working in close proximity. Moreover, the burning of plane fuel releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. This is a pressing concern, as climate change poses an existential threat to our planet.In my opinion, while cheap air travel has undoubtedly opened up new possibilities for many, the environmental consequences cannot be ignored. A more sustainable approach would be to make air travel more expensive, thereby discouraging unnecessary flights and encouraging alternative modes of transportation. This could also lead to investments in cleaner technologies and more efficient flight routes, mitigating the environmental impact of air travel.Ultimately, striking a balance between accessibility and sustainability is crucial. Governments and airlines must work together to find innovative solutions that minimize the environmental footprint of air travel while still making it accessible to a wide range of people. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of air travel are not outweighed by its ecological costs.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;Some people prefer to live in a small town, while others prefer to live in a big city. As for me, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, if I have always wanted to find a job, a place to live that is not too far from my workplace is a must. Big cities typically have more job opportunities and a wider range of industries to choose from, increasing the chances of finding employment. For instance, cities like New York and London are hubs for various sectors such as finance, technology, and healthcare, offering numerous job openings. Moreover, living in a big city often means that I can enjoy modern life and have more access to advanced facilities like public transportation, healthcare, and entertainment options.Living in big cities also means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. Cities offer a diverse range of cultural events, museums, and libraries, providing endless opportunities for learning and personal growth. For example, cities like Paris and Tokyo are renowned for their rich cultural heritage, with numerous museums, galleries, and historical landmarks that offer a wealth of knowledge and inspiration. Furthermore, the fast-paced and dynamic environment of big cities encourages innovation, creativity, and progress, allowing individuals to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;"Salary increases and promotions to new positions are the most common methods used by organizations to reward employees for good work. However, from my point of view, these are not the only effective ways to encourage further good work. In fact, there are several other rewards that can be just as motivating, if not more so.One of the most effective ways to reward employees for good work is to provide them with opportunities for professional development. Providing professional training, for example, can be a great motivator for employees who are eager to improve their skills and advance in their careers. Not only does it show that the organization is invested in their growth and development, but it also gives them the tools and knowledge they need to take on new challenges and responsibilities. For instance, a company like Google provides its employees with various training programs and workshops to enhance their skills and knowledge, which motivates them to perform better and be more productive.Another effective way to reward employees for good work is to offer flexible work arrangements. With the rise of remote work, employees are no longer tied to traditional office hours and locations. By offering flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or flexible hours, organizations can demonstrate their trust and appreciation for their employees' hard work and dedication. This can lead to increased job satisfaction, reduced turnover rates, and improved work-life balance.Additionally, recognizing employees' achievements publicly can also be an effective way to reward them for good work. A simple ""thank you"" or acknowledgement of an employee's hard work and achievements can go a long way in motivating them to continue performing at a high level. For example, a company like Amazon has a recognition program called ""Kudos"" which allows employees to recognize and reward their peers for their hard work and contributions.In conclusion, while salary increases and promotions to new positions are common ways to reward employees for good work, they are not the only effective ways to encourage further good work. Providing professional training, offering flexible work arrangements, and recognizing employees' achievements publicly can be just as motivating, if not more so. By offering these alternative rewards, organizations can demonstrate their appreciation and investment in their employees' growth and development, leading to increased job satisfaction, productivity, and retention."
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;The debate surrounding whether university students should be required to attend classes has sparked intense discussion. While some believe that mandatory attendance is essential for academic success, I firmly agree that attending classes should be optional for students. This perspective may seem counterintuitive, but it allows students to take ownership of their learning process, utilizing alternative sources and self-directed study.In today's digital age, students can access a vast array of educational resources outside the traditional classroom setting. Online lectures, tutorials, and educational websites provide valuable learning opportunities that can be tailored to individual learning styles and pace. For instance, students can watch video lectures, online tutorials, or podcasts that cater to their specific needs, allowing them to learn at their own convenience. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for students who may have conflicting schedules, family commitments, or learning disabilities that make traditional classroom attendance challenging.Moreover, students can also utilize the university library as a productive study space to focus on topics they struggle with. Without the distraction of a classroom environment, students can immerse themselves in their studies, taking the time to review and understand complex concepts at their own pace. This self-directed learning approach enables students to take ownership of their academic success, developing essential skills such as time management, self-motivation, and critical thinking.In conclusion, making class attendance optional allows students to explore alternative learning methods that may be more effective for them. By giving students the autonomy to choose their learning approach, universities can foster a more inclusive and flexible learning environment that caters to diverse needs and preferences. Ultimately, this approach can lead to improved academic outcomes, increased student satisfaction, and better preparedness for the demands of the modern workforce.

166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of advanced technology. In recent years, computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with one another. While some people argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I firmly believe that they have brought convenience and easiness to our lives.One of the primary reasons computers have made life easier is that they have enabled easier access to information. With just a few clicks, we can access a vast array of information on the internet, ranging from educational resources to news and entertainment. This has greatly reduced the time and effort required to gather information, making it possible for us to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently. For instance, students can now easily research and complete assignments, while professionals can stay up-to-date with the latest developments in their field.Another significant advantage of computers is that they have increased the quality of communication. Email, instant messaging, and video conferencing have made it possible for people to connect with each other across geographical distances, fostering global communication and collaboration. This has enabled businesses to operate more efficiently, while also allowing friends and family to stay in touch, regardless of their location.In conclusion, computers have undoubtedly brought convenience and easiness to our lives. By providing easier access to information and increasing the quality of communication, computers have transformed the way we live, work, and interact with one another. While some may argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I firmly believe that their benefits far outweigh their drawbacks.
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;The advancement of technology has made it possible for office workers to work from home, a trend that has sparked debate among employers and employees alike. While some people think that working from home brings too much convenience, I disagree. In my opinion, working from home should be encouraged, but it's not without its drawbacks.On the one hand, working from home provides employees with the flexibility to manage their work schedule and work at their own pace. This can lead to increased productivity and better work-life balance. Additionally, it reduces the need for lengthy commutes, saving time, money, and reducing stress. Many employees appreciate the comfort and convenience of working from home, which can boost their morale and job satisfaction.However, I acknowledge that working from home is not without its challenges. Some of the best conditions for productivity, such as a quiet and dedicated workspace, are not always available at home. Moreover, working without pressure and interaction can lead to procrastination and decreased motivation. The lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and supervisors can also lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from the team. Furthermore, the blurred lines between work and personal life can lead to burnout and the expectation of being available 24/7.Despite these challenges, I still believe that working from home can be beneficial for employees and employers. With the right mindset and strategies, employees can stay motivated and productive while working from home. Employers can also benefit from reduced overhead costs and increased employee retention. To mitigate the disadvantages, employers can establish clear expectations, provide regular check-ins, and encourage virtual team-building activities. By finding a balance between the benefits and drawbacks, working from home can be a win-win for both employees and employers.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;The role of a university professor has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that they should focus on research, while others believe that their primary responsibility is to educate students. In my opinion, the main role of a professor is to educate students, and they should spend more time preparing courses than conducting research.While research is an essential aspect of a professor's job, it should not come at the expense of their teaching responsibilities. If professors are too busy with research and neglect preparing appropriate courses for their students, it can lead to a decline in the quality of education provided by the university. This, in turn, can damage the reputation of the institution and deter potential students from enrolling. Universities rely heavily on their academic reputation to attract students, and professors play a crucial role in maintaining this reputation. Therefore, it is essential that they prioritize their teaching responsibilities and allocate sufficient time to prepare engaging and informative courses.That being said, this does not mean that professors cannot integrate research into their teaching. In fact, many professors can teach students valuable skills and knowledge through research and projects. By involving students in research projects, professors can provide them with hands-on experience and help them develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This approach not only benefits the students but also enriches the professor's research, as students can bring fresh perspectives and ideas to the project.In conclusion, while research is an important aspect of a professor's job, their primary responsibility is to educate students. Professors should spend more time preparing courses and involving students in research projects, rather than prioritizing research over teaching. By doing so, they can provide students with a high-quality education, maintain the reputation of the university, and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in their field.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;The past century has witnessed tremendous technological progress, which has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with one another. While it is undeniable that technology has made remarkable contributions to various aspects of our lives, I agree that it also has negative effects, and the extent of these effects is significant.On the one hand, the development of technology has been a key driver of economic growth and improvement of living standards. Advanced technology has enabled mass production, increased efficiency, and reduced costs, making goods and services more accessible and affordable. Moreover, technology has enabled people to enhance their living levels and healthcare standards. For instance, medical technology has led to the discovery of new treatments and medicines, improving healthcare outcomes and increasing life expectancy.On the other hand, technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. The rapid development and disposal of technological devices have resulted in a significant increase in electronic waste, polluting our environment and harming wildlife. Furthermore, the over-reliance on technology has led to social isolation, decreased face-to-face communication, and a decline in mental health. The constant stream of information from social media has also created a culture of instant gratification, leading to decreased attention span and increased stress levels.In conclusion, while technological progress has undoubtedly improved our lives in many ways, its negative effects on the environment and society cannot be ignored. It is crucial that we acknowledge these effects and take steps to mitigate them, such as implementing sustainable practices and promoting responsible technology use. By doing so, we can ensure that technological progress continues to enhance our lives while minimizing its negative consequences.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;The statement that a large proportion of a country's health budget should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures raises a valid point, especially in today's world. The concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens, promoting overall well-being and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.It is widely acknowledged that prevention is better than cure. By allocating a larger share of the health budget to health education and preventative measures, governments can empower citizens to take control of their health, enabling them to make informed choices and adopt healthy lifestyles. This approach can lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, which are major contributors to healthcare costs.Moreover, investing in health education and prevention can have long-term benefits, including a reduction in healthcare expenditure. By preventing illnesses, governments can avoid the high costs associated with treatment, hospitalization, and medication. Furthermore, a healthier population is more productive, contributing to the overall economic growth of the country.While treatment is essential, it is crucial to acknowledge that it is often a reactive approach, focusing on addressing health issues after they have arisen. In contrast, prevention is a proactive approach, addressing the root causes of health problems and promoting overall well-being.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment. By prioritizing health education and preventative measures, governments can create a healthier, more informed population, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and promoting sustainable healthcare.
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;When it comes to choosing a place to live, university students are often faced with two popular options: university dormitories and apartments in the community. Both choices have their advantages and disadvantages, and the decision ultimately depends on individual preferences. Many students prefer to live in university dormitories, while others opt for an apartment in the city.University dormitories offer a range of benefits, including convenience, social opportunities, and access to university facilities. Living on campus can be a great way to meet new people and get involved in university life, with many dorms hosting events and activities for residents. Additionally, dorms are often close to classrooms, libraries, and other essential facilities, making it easy to get to classes and study sessions. However, dorms can be noisy, with shared living spaces and thin walls, which can be distracting for students who value quiet study time.On the other hand, living in an apartment in the community offers a different set of advantages. For one, apartments often provide more freedom and independence, as students have their own space and can live according to their own schedule. Apartments also offer more space and amenities, such as kitchens and living rooms, which can make for a more comfortable living experience. Furthermore, living in the community can provide students with a more authentic experience of the city, with access to local shops, restaurants, and cultural events.After considering the level of freedom, studying conditions, and economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer living in an apartment. While university dormitories offer convenience and social opportunities, I value my independence and freedom to live according to my own schedule. I also believe that having my own space and amenities, such as a kitchen, would make for a more comfortable and productive living experience. Additionally, living in the community would allow me to experience the city in a more authentic way, which I believe would be beneficial for my personal and academic growth.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"When it comes to movies, people's preferences vary greatly. Some enjoy thought-provoking, serious films, while others prefer lighthearted, entertaining ones. As for me, I have a soft spot for movies that balance both aspects - films that not only entertain but also make me think. A perfect example of such a movie is ""Click,"" a comedy that takes a serious approach to the importance of maintaining a balanced life between family and work responsibilities.On the one hand, serious movies often leave a lasting impact on viewers. They are usually designed to express profound thoughts about love, humanity, and the human condition. These films can be quite powerful, as they challenge our perspectives and encourage us to reflect on our values and beliefs. Moreover, serious movies often shed light on the darker aspects of society, sparking important conversations and raising awareness about pressing issues.On the other hand, purely entertaining movies can be just what we need to unwind and escape from the stresses of everyday life. They provide a much-needed break from reality, allowing us to laugh, cry, or simply be amazed by impressive special effects. However, these movies rarely linger in our minds long after the credits roll, and their impact is often limited to the viewing experience itself.In contrast, movies like ""Click"" offer the best of both worlds. They entertain us with humor and wit, yet also prompt us to think critically about our priorities and values. By presenting relatable characters and situations, these films inspire us to reevaluate our own lives and make positive changes. For this reason, I prefer movies that balance entertainment and substance, as they provide a more enriching and memorable viewing experience."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;In my point of view, the disadvantages of overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people by the media outweigh its advantages. The excessive focus on the private lives of celebrities and public figures has become a staple of modern media, with television, newspapers, and magazines often prioritizing sensationalized gossip over substantial reporting.Firstly, gossip involves misleading images and fabricated stories for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The media frequently manipulate and distort facts to create scandalous headlines, which not only damage the reputation of the individuals involved but also contribute to a culture of misinformation. This type of reporting undermines the credibility of journalism and erodes the public's trust in the media.Furthermore, sensationalism distracts the viewers from public or social problems that require attention and discussion. By devoting an inordinate amount of coverage to the personal lives of famous people, the media diverts attention away from pressing issues such as politics, education, and healthcare. This creates a society that is more invested in the latest celebrity scandal than in the issues that affect their daily lives. As a result, the media fails to fulfill its responsibility to inform and educate the public, instead perpetuating a culture of voyeurism and escapism.Ultimately, the media's fixation on the personal lives of famous people has severe consequences, including the erosion of journalistic integrity, the distraction from pressing social issues, and the perpetuation of a culture of misinformation. Therefore, I firmly believe that the disadvantages of overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people by the media outweigh its advantages, and a more balanced approach to reporting is necessary.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;"As a lover of travel, I have had the privilege of visiting numerous museums around the world, and I firmly believe that they are an integral part of any tour. Visiting a museum is not just about seeing artifacts and exhibits; it's about immersing oneself in the history, culture, and essence of a new place.Primarily, museums offer a unique opportunity to learn about the history and customs of a new destination. By exploring exhibits and artifacts, visitors can gain a deeper understanding of the local culture, its evolution, and its significance. For instance, the British Museum in London is a treasure trove of historical artifacts from around the world, including the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, and the Magna Carta. Visiting this museum provides a fascinating insight into the history of human civilization, from ancient Egypt to modern times.Secondarily, visiting a well-known museum can also broaden one's horizon. Museums often feature temporary exhibitions that showcase art, science, and technology from around the world. These exhibitions can challenge our assumptions, spark new ideas, and inspire creativity. For example, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City has hosted numerous groundbreaking exhibitions, including works by Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Frida Kahlo. Visiting MoMA can be a transformative experience, introducing visitors to new art movements, styles, and techniques.In conclusion, visiting a museum is a quintessential part of any tour, offering a unique window into the history, culture, and essence of a new place. Whether it's to learn about the local customs, broaden one's horizon, or simply appreciate the beauty of art and artifacts, museums have something to offer every visitor. As a lover of travel, I can attest that visiting an excellent museum is often the highlight of any trip, leaving a lasting impression and a deeper appreciation for the destination."
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";The rapid advancement of technology has revolutionized the way we approach education, offering students the flexibility to choose between studying at home via digital platforms and attending traditional schools. While studying at home using technology has its conveniences, I firmly believe that traditional schooling is the better option.On the surface, studying at home via computer or television seems appealing. It allows students to learn at their own pace, anytime, and from the comfort of their own homes. This convenience is especially beneficial for those who live far from schools or have scheduling conflicts. However, I believe that this method of learning has a significant drawback: it may be difficult to complete a course without the structured environment and direct guidance that a traditional classroom provides. Distance education courses lack the interpersonal interactions that are crucial for a comprehensive learning experience.Traditional schools, on the other hand, offer a holistic education that goes beyond academics. One of the most significant advantages of traditional schooling is socialization. Schools provide a unique environment where students can establish relationships with their classmates, an aspect that is just as important as the academic learning itself. Interacting with peers and teachers helps in developing essential life skills such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution. Computers or televisions, no matter how advanced, cannot teach us how to get along with people, empathize with their perspectives, and work collaboratively towards a common goal.In conclusion, while the idea of studying at home using technology is tempting, I believe that the benefits of traditional schooling far outweigh the conveniences offered by digital learning platforms. The socialization and interpersonal skills developed in a traditional school setting are invaluable and play a crucial role in shaping a student's personal and professional life.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;The recent announcement of a large shopping center being built in our neighborhood has sparked a mixed reaction among residents. While some are concerned about the potential drawbacks, I firmly support this plan for several compelling reasons.First and foremost, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide residents with a more convenient place to go shopping. No longer will we have to travel to distant areas of the city to access a variety of stores and services. The shopping center will be a one-stop destination where we can fulfill all our shopping needs, saving us time and effort. This convenience will be especially beneficial for the elderly, parents with young children, and those with mobility issues who may find it challenging to travel long distances.Another significant advantage of the shopping center is that it will offer competitive pricing, making it more likely for us to buy goods at lower prices. With a large number of stores and services under one roof, businesses will be forced to compete with each other, driving prices down and providing residents with better value for their money. This will be especially beneficial for low-income families who are often forced to make difficult choices between essential expenses.In addition to these benefits, the shopping center will also help to reduce travel time and expenses. Currently, many of us travel to other areas of the city to access shopping centers, resulting in wasted time, fuel, and energy. With a shopping center in our own neighborhood, we will be able to shop locally, reducing our carbon footprint and saving time that can be better spent on other activities.In conclusion, I strongly support the plan to build a large shopping center in our neighborhood. The convenience, competitive pricing, and reduced travel time will make a significant positive impact on our daily lives, making it easier, cheaper, and more enjoyable to shop.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";In today's fast-paced world, where demands and expectations are mounting, it is essential to possess skills that enable individuals to navigate the pressures of modern life. Among the numerous skills that can contribute to success, one crucial ability stands out: stress management. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. However, if not managed properly, it can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety, which are increasingly common among people of all ages.In our frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress. Learning to manage stress is vital to maintaining good mental and physical health, as well as achieving success in various aspects of life. Effective stress management involves developing techniques to recognize and mitigate the negative effects of stress, such as meditation, deep breathing, and exercise. By incorporating these practices into daily life, individuals can reduce their stress levels, improve their mood, and enhance their overall well-being.Furthermore, stress management is essential for productivity and performance. When individuals are able to manage stress, they can focus better, make sound decisions, and work more efficiently. This, in turn, leads to greater accomplishments and a sense of fulfillment. For instance, a student who can manage exam stress is more likely to perform well and achieve their academic goals. Similarly, a professional who can handle work-related stress is more likely to meet deadlines, build strong relationships with colleagues, and advance in their career.In conclusion, stress management is a vital skill for success in today's world. By learning to recognize and mitigate stress, individuals can protect their mental and physical health, improve their productivity, and achieve their goals. As the demands of modern life continue to escalate, the importance of stress management will only continue to grow.
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";The importance of groups and organizations in people's lives cannot be overstated. These collectives play a vital role in shaping individuals' experiences, fostering personal growth, and providing a sense of belonging. In this essay, we will explore the significance of groups and organizations in people's lives, highlighting their role in socialization, skill-building, and personal development.One of the primary reasons groups and organizations are essential is that they provide a platform for individuals to gain experiences and achieve their goals. For instance, a sports team offers a chance for members to develop their athletic skills, learn teamwork, and compete at various levels. Similarly, professional organizations, such as networking groups, enable individuals to connect with like-minded professionals, share knowledge, and advance in their careers. These experiences not only enhance one's skills but also boost confidence and self-esteem.Groups and organizations also play a crucial role in the process of socialization, from childhood to adulthood. For children, groups like the Boy Scouts or Girl Guides teach valuable life skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and community service. As people grow older, groups like book clubs, hiking groups, or volunteer organizations provide opportunities to meet new people, make friends, and develop emotional intelligence. Through these interactions, individuals learn to communicate effectively, empathize with others, and develop a sense of responsibility.A solid group can be a suited environment for individuals to improve themselves and broaden their horizons. For example, a study group can provide a supportive setting for students to learn from one another, share resources, and stay motivated. A community organization can offer a platform for individuals to engage in activities they are passionate about, develop new skills, and take on leadership roles. These groups can also provide a sense of security and stability, which is particularly important for individuals going through significant life changes or challenges.In conclusion, groups and organizations are essential components of people's lives, offering a range of benefits that enhance personal growth, skill-building, and socialization. Whether it is a sports team, a professional network, or a community group, these collectives provide a sense of belonging, opportunities for development, and a supportive environment that fosters success.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;The government's plan to build a new university in our community has sparked a heated debate among residents. On one hand, establishing a university in our neighborhood would bring numerous benefits, while on the other hand, it would also introduce some drawbacks. In this essay, we will delve into the advantages and disadvantages of setting up a new university in our community.One of the primary advantages of having a university in our community is that it would provide more opportunities for people to pursue their studies. Currently, many students have to travel to neighboring cities or towns to access higher education, which can be costly and time-consuming. With a local university, students would have easier access to quality education, and this would undoubtedly lead to a more educated and skilled workforce. Moreover, the university would attract scholars and researchers from all over the world, enriching our community's cultural diversity and fostering a spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship.However, the introduction of a new university would also bring some social problems. For instance, the influx of students would lead to an increase in housing demand, potentially driving up rent prices and making it difficult for low-income families to find affordable accommodation. Additionally, the university would generate noise and traffic, which could disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of our community. There is also the risk of an increase in crime rates, as is often the case in areas with large student populations.In conclusion, while establishing a new university in our community would bring numerous benefits, including increased access to education and cultural diversity, it would also introduce some social problems, such as housing shortages and increased noise and crime.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";The question of whether the government should provide free college education to its citizens has been a topic of debate for quite some time. On one hand, some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to college. They argue that education is a fundamental right and that everyone should have access to it, regardless of their financial background. However, I firmly believe that individuals should pay for their own college tuition.One of the main reasons for my stance is the sheer cost of providing free college education to every citizen. The government would have to bear a significant financial burden, which would inevitably lead to an increase in taxes. This would be an unfair burden on the taxpayers, many of whom may not have the means or the desire to pursue higher education. Moreover, the government has many other pressing priorities, such as healthcare, infrastructure, and national security, which would likely suffer if a significant portion of the budget were allocated to funding free college education.Furthermore, I believe that college education is a personal choice, and individuals should be responsible for their own educational expenses. Many students who pursue higher education do so with the intention of improving their career prospects and earning potential. It is only fair that they should bear the cost of their own education, rather than relying on the government to foot the bill.In conclusion, while I understand the argument that education is a fundamental right, I firmly believe that individuals should pay for their own college tuition. The cost of providing free college education would be prohibitively expensive, and it is only fair that individuals should take responsibility for their own educational expenses.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";The notion that television has destroyed communication among friends and family has been a topic of debate in recent years. While it is true that excessive television viewing can have negative effects on interpersonal relationships, I disagree with the statement. In my opinion, television provides numerous benefits that outweigh its potential drawbacks.On the one hand, television offers a wide range of benefits that enhance our lives. It provides us with a means to unwind and relax after a long day, allowing us to temporarily escape from the stresses of everyday life. Moreover, television keeps us informed about current events and news from around the world, enabling us to stay up-to-date on global issues. Furthermore, television broadens our minds by exposing us to different cultures, ideas, and perspectives, fostering a more empathetic and open-minded society.On the other hand, it is true that excessive television viewing can have negative effects on communication among friends and family. Children, in particular, are susceptible to learning behaviors from what they see on television, rather than from their parents or caregivers. This can lead to a decline in face-to-face communication skills and a lack of emotional intelligence. However, this is not a reason to condemn television altogether.Instead, parents and caregivers should take responsibility for monitoring their children's television viewing habits and engaging them in conversations about what they watch. This way, children can learn to critically evaluate what they see on television and develop healthy communication skills. In conclusion, while television has its drawbacks, its benefits far outweigh its negative effects. By using television responsibly and engaging in open communication, we can harness its benefits while maintaining strong relationships with our friends and family.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life.";Attending a live performance, such as a play, concert, or sporting event, is undoubtedly more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. As an avid football fan, I can attest to the thrill and excitement of attending a live match, especially when it involves my home team.First and foremost, attending a live football match is a deeply fulfilling experience. Watching football stars play the game with your own eyes is a unique experience that cannot be replicated by watching on television. The energy and tension in the stadium are palpable, and sharing this experience with thousands of fellow fans creates a sense of community and camaraderie that is impossible to replicate while watching alone at home. For example, when my home team plays, it is much more gratifying to be side by side with other fans, cheering them on, rather than watching the match in solitude. The collective roar of the crowd, the chanting, and the sheer excitement of being part of a massive gathering of like-minded individuals all contribute to an unforgettable experience.While tickets to live events may be more expensive than watching on television, the entertainment value gained from attending a live event far outweighs the cost. At a live football match, for instance, you are not just watching a game - you are part of a spectacle that involves music, cheerleaders, and a festival-like atmosphere. The electricity in the air, the thrill of live competition, and the chance to see your heroes in action all combine to create an experience that is far more engaging and memorable than watching on television.In conclusion, attending a live performance is undoubtedly more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. The unique experience of sharing a live event with thousands of others, combined with the excitement and energy of the performance itself, creates an unforgettable experience that cannot be replicated by watching on television.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";The notion that renewable resources of energy, such as solar, wind, and hydro power, will soon replace fossil fuels like natural gas, oil, and coal is a topic of much debate. While these renewable energy sources are indeed crucial components of our current and future energy strategy, I disagree that they will soon supplant fossil fuels as our primary energy sources.From my perspective, there are several reasons why renewable energy sources cannot replace fossil fuels in the near future. One major limitation is the current state of technology. Despite significant advancements in recent years, the technology behind renewable energy is still relatively expensive and inefficient compared to traditional fossil fuel-based power generation. The cost of harnessing and converting renewable energy into usable forms is high, making it less competitive with fossil fuels.Furthermore, the intermittency of renewable energy sources poses a significant challenge. Solar and wind power, for example, are not always available, as they are dependent on weather conditions. This unpredictability makes it difficult to rely solely on these sources for our energy needs. In contrast, fossil fuels can be easily stored and transported, ensuring a consistent supply of energy.While it is true that renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly important in our energy mix, I believe that they will complement, rather than replace, fossil fuels in the near future. As technology continues to evolve and costs decrease, the role of renewable energy will undoubtedly grow. However, for now, fossil fuels will likely remain the primary source of energy, with renewable energy playing a supporting role.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;I disagree with the prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. While it is true that land used for agriculture, real estate industry, and industry can benefit the whole society, I firmly believe that the preservation of land for endangered animals is equally crucial.Firstly, agriculture, real estate industry, and industry do provide numerous benefits to society, including food, shelter, and employment opportunities. However, the destruction of natural habitats for these purposes can have severe and long-lasting consequences on the environment. The loss of biodiversity can lead to the collapse of ecosystems, resulting in unforeseen effects on human health, climate, and the economy. For instance, the destruction of bee habitats due to agricultural expansion has led to a significant decline in bee populations, threatening the pollination of many crops.Secondly, while it is true that more farmlands and industries can provide job opportunities, decreasing unemployment and crime rates, it is essential to consider the long-term consequences of these actions. The preservation of natural habitats can also create employment opportunities in conservation, eco-tourism, and sustainable forestry. In fact, a study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature found that protected areas can generate up to three times more revenue than the cost of maintaining them.Moreover, endangered animals play a vital role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. The loss of a single species can have a ripple effect throughout the entire ecosystem, leading to unforeseen and potentially disastrous consequences. For example, the loss of apex predators can lead to an increase in herbivore populations, resulting in overgrazing and soil erosion.In conclusion, while human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are important, they should not come at the expense of preserving land for endangered animals. The preservation of natural habitats is crucial for maintaining the balance of ecosystems, and can also provide employment opportunities in conservation and eco-tourism.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;When it comes to learning a foreign language, there are different opinions on whether it is more beneficial to do so in the country where the language is originally spoken or in one's own country. In my opinion, learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning it in a country with another language.First and foremost, people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same language in their own countries. For instance, when a learner is immersed in a foreign environment, they are constantly exposed to the language in its authentic form, hearing native speakers and seeing the language in use in everyday situations. This exposure helps them develop a more nuanced understanding of the language, including its idiomatic expressions, cultural references, and subtle grammatical rules. In contrast, learners who study a foreign language in their own country may miss out on these contextual cues, leading to a more superficial understanding of the language.On the other hand, person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. However, this method can only go so far in replicating the richness and complexity of the language as it is spoken in its original country. In the country where the language is spoken, learners can engage in spontaneous conversations, listen to a variety of accents and speaking styles, and pick up on the language's rhythms and intonations. These experiences are difficult to replicate in a classroom setting, no matter how skilled the teacher may be.In conclusion, while there are some benefits to learning a foreign language in one's own country, I firmly believe that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial. The immersive environment and authentic exposure to the language provide a depth and richness of understanding that is difficult to match in a classroom setting.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";The debate surrounding the inclusion of physical exercise in school curricula has gained significant attention in recent years. While some argue that students should focus solely on academic studies, I firmly believe that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Not only is exercise beneficial for maintaining a healthy body, but it also has a profound impact on mental well-being and cognitive function.Research has shown that daily exercise can improve brain function in children, enhancing their ability to concentrate, learn, and retain information. Physical activity has been proven to boost memory, problem-solving skills, and creativity, ultimately contributing to better academic performance. Moreover, incorporating exercise into the daily routine from an early age teaches children the value of physical activity, fostering healthy habits that will benefit them throughout their lives.Including physical exercise in the school day can also have a positive impact on students' mental health. Regular physical activity has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, while promoting a sense of well-being and self-esteem. This, in turn, can create a more positive and productive learning environment, as students are better equipped to handle the challenges of academic studies.In conclusion, incorporating physical exercise into the school day is not only beneficial for students' physical health but also for their mental and cognitive well-being. By teaching children the importance of physical activity from a young age, we can instill healthy habits that will benefit them throughout their lives. As such, I strongly believe that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day, complementing academic studies and promoting a holistic approach to education.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;In some countries, teenagers are increasingly taking up jobs while still pursuing their studies. However, in my opinion, it is not a good idea for teenagers to have a job while they are still students. Having a job at a young age can interfere with their life in various ways, ultimately affecting their overall well-being and development.One of the primary concerns is the impact on their health. Teenagers already lead busy lives, balancing schoolwork, extracurricular activities, and social life. Adding a job to this mix can lead to chronic fatigue, stress, and anxiety. With inadequate sleep and poor nutrition, their physical health may also suffer. Furthermore, the pressure to perform well academically and professionally can take a toll on their mental health.Moreover, having a job can divert their mind from studies, which should be their primary focus at this stage. A part-time job can be a significant distraction, causing them to neglect their schoolwork and miss out on valuable learning experiences. This can ultimately affect their academic performance, hindering their future prospects and opportunities.Another significant concern is that having a job can take away their childhood phase from their life. Teenage years are a critical period of development, and they should be spent exploring interests, building relationships, and enjoying their youth. A job can force them to grow up too quickly, robbing them of the carefree years that are essential for their emotional and psychological growth.In conclusion, while having a job can provide teenagers with valuable work experience and skills, it is not a good idea for them to have a job while still students. The potential risks to their health, academic performance, and emotional well-being outweigh any benefits. It is essential for teenagers to prioritize their studies and focus on developing their skills and interests without the burden of a part-time job.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;The debate over the role of zoos has been ongoing for years, with some people believing they serve a useful function, while others see them as cruel and wrong. Zoos have been a part of our world for ages, with establishments all over the globe, and have become popular places for entertainment and education.On the one hand, zoos provide a unique opportunity for people to observe and learn about various animal species. They offer educational programs, workshops, and interactive exhibits that promote awareness and appreciation for wildlife. Many people, especially children, have developed a love and respect for animals after visiting a zoo. Moreover, zoos also play a significant role in conservation efforts, providing a safe habitat for endangered species and participating in breeding programs to increase their populations.On the other hand, there are valid concerns about the ethics of keeping animals in captivity. Some argue that zoos are essentially prisons for animals, depriving them of their natural habitats and freedom. Many animals in zoos exhibit abnormal behaviors, such as pacing, self-mutilation, and aggression, which can be indicative of stress and unhappiness. Moreover, the space and conditions in zoos can never truly replicate the animals' natural environments, leading to a life of captivity and confinement.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the benefits of zoos in terms of entertainment and education, I agree with the viewpoint that it's cruel and wrong to confine animals in zoos.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;When it comes to studying, students often have different preferences. Some may prefer to study alone, while others may prefer to study with a group of students. As for me, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of the numerous opportunities it presents.Studying in a group allows me to receive help from my peers when I need it most. When I am struggling with a particular concept or subject, my friends can explain it to me in a way that makes sense. This not only helps me understand the material better but also saves me time and frustration. For instance, during our math exam preparation, one of my friends, who excelled in math, explained a complex theorem to me, which I had been struggling with for days. His explanation was clear and concise, and I was able to grasp the concept easily.In addition to receiving help, studying in a group also improves my learning skills. When we work together, we share our knowledge and ideas, which enhances our understanding of the subject matter. We can discuss topics, share notes, and learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. For example, while studying for our history exam, we created a timeline of events together, which helped us to see the big picture and understand the relationships between different historical events.Furthermore, studying in a group promotes healthy competition and motivation. When we work together, we encourage and motivate each other to do our best. We set goals and challenges for ourselves, which helps us to stay focused and driven. For instance, we made a pact to finish our assignments early and reward ourselves with a study break, which kept us motivated and on track.In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of the opportunities it presents. I receive help from my peers, improve my learning skills, and stay motivated and driven. Studying in a group has not only enhanced my academic performance but also made learning a more enjoyable and social experience.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;The concept of friendship is a fundamental aspect of human relationships, and it is widely acknowledged that friendships play a vital role in shaping our lives. Despite the significance of friendship, people's preferences for spending time with friends vary greatly. While some individuals prefer to maintain a small, intimate circle of one or two close friends, others opt for a larger social network. In this essay, we will explore the advantages of each approach and examine which one is more beneficial.On one hand, having a small circle of close friends has its advantages. For instance, it allows for deeper, more meaningful relationships to develop. With a smaller group, individuals can invest more time and energy into each friendship, leading to a stronger emotional bond. Moreover, close friends can provide a sense of security and stability, which is essential for emotional well-being.On the other hand, spending time with a large number of friends offers a different set of benefits. In my view, I prefer this approach because it provides the opportunity to learn from others' experiences and broaden one's perspective. With a larger social network, individuals are exposed to diverse backgrounds, interests, and ways of thinking. This diversity can lead to personal growth, as one can gain new insights and ideas from others. Furthermore, having a large number of friends can also provide a sense of belonging and connection, which is essential for our emotional and mental well-being.In conclusion, while both approaches have their advantages, I believe that spending time with a large number of friends is more beneficial. Not only does it provide the opportunity to learn from others, but it also offers a sense of belonging and connection. Ultimately, the key to a fulfilling social life is finding a balance between depth and breadth in our relationships.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The debate about whether governments should prioritize improving roads and highways or public transportation has been ongoing. While some argue that investing in roads and highways is crucial for economic growth and development, others contend that public transportation is the way to go. In this essay, I will argue that governments should spend more money on improving public transportation, such as buses, trains, and subways.One of the most significant advantages of public transportation is its ability to conserve natural resources. With the world's natural resources gradually running out, it is essential that we find ways to reduce our consumption. Public transportation provides an excellent solution to this problem. Instead of using many private cars, people can use buses, trains, and subways, which can transport far more people while using less oil and gasoline per person. This not only reduces our reliance on non-renewable energy sources but also decreases the amount of pollution released into the air.The environmental benefits of public transportation cannot be overstated. The more cars that are driven, the more pollution is released into the air, contributing to global warming. In contrast, public transportation significantly reduces the number of cars on the road, resulting in lower emissions and a healthier environment. Furthermore, public transportation encourages a more sociable lifestyle. When people use buses, trains, and subways, they interact with others, fostering a sense of community and social connection.In conclusion, while improving roads and highways is important, I firmly believe that governments should prioritize public transportation. Not only does it conserve natural resources and reduce pollution, but it also promotes a more sociable lifestyle. By investing in public transportation, governments can create a more sustainable, environmentally-friendly, and connected community.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;The debate about keeping animals in zoos has been ongoing for years, with some people arguing that it is necessary for their conservation and education, while others believe that it is cruel and unjust. I disagree with the idea that animals should be kept in zoos, as I believe that it is our responsibility to ensure that they live safely and comfortably in their natural habitats.Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals, providing them with a safe and controlled environment, and allowing people to learn about and appreciate these creatures. However, this argument is based on a narrow perspective that prioritizes human interests over animal welfare. The fact is that animals in zoos are often kept in enclosures that are a fraction of the size of their natural habitats, and are subjected to stress, boredom, and other forms of psychological distress.On the other hand, there are those who believe that animals are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention or concern. This view is not only outdated but also morally reprehensible. Animals are living beings that feel pain, joy, and fear, just like humans do, and they have the right to live freely and without exploitation.In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment. This means supporting conservation efforts that protect and restore their natural habitats, rather than keeping them captive in zoos. It also means recognizing their rights and dignity as living beings, and treating them with the respect and compassion that they deserve. By doing so, we can work towards a world where animals are valued and protected, rather than exploited and confined.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;If a university plans to develop a new research center in my country, I would wholeheartedly recommend establishing a center for research in agriculture over a center for business research. There are several compelling reasons that lead me to this conclusion.First and foremost, a center for research in agriculture can significantly contribute to the better exploitation of our country's land. Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, and in our country, it has the potential to be a game-changer. By investing in agricultural research, we can discover new methods of farming, improve crop yields, and increase food production. This, in turn, can lead to food security, reduced poverty, and improved living standards for our citizens.Secondly, an agricultural research center can play a vital role in boosting our country's economy. Currently, the agriculture sector accounts for only thirty percent of the market share, indicating immense potential for growth. By conducting research in agriculture, we can identify new opportunities for investment, improve farming practices, and increase productivity. This can lead to increased exports, job creation, and economic growth.In contrast, while a center for business research is also important, I believe that the benefits of an agricultural research center far outweigh those of a business research center. By investing in agriculture, we can address some of the country's most pressing issues, such as food security and poverty reduction. Furthermore, an agricultural research center can also have a positive impact on the environment, as sustainable farming practices can be developed and promoted.In conclusion, I strongly believe that a center for research in agriculture is the way forward for our country. It has the potential to improve the lives of our citizens, boost our economy, and ensure a sustainable future.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;People learn in various ways, and it is essential to recognize that each individual has their unique method of acquiring knowledge and skills. In today's fast-paced world, people have a multitude of things to learn throughout their lives. To broaden their knowledge and skills, they employ several ways of learning, including reading, listening, and doing things practically. Among these methods, I firmly believe that learning by doing things myself is the most effective way to acquire new skills and knowledge.Personally, I find that learning by doing things develops my maturity and self-reliance. When I take on tasks and projects by myself, I learn to depend on my own abilities and judgment. This approach has been invaluable in my personal and academic life. For instance, when I was learning to play the guitar, I found that watching tutorials and reading instructions was not enough. It was only when I started practicing and experimenting with different chords and techniques that I truly began to understand the instrument. Similarly, when I was working on a group project, I realized that taking charge of a task and seeing it through to completion not only taught me about the subject matter but also about time management, teamwork, and problem-solving.In conclusion, learning by doing things myself has been the most effective way for me to acquire new skills and knowledge. By taking on challenges and working independently, I have developed my maturity, self-reliance, and problem-solving abilities. While reading and listening are essential skills, I believe that practical experience is invaluable in today's fast-paced world, where people have a multitude of things to learn throughout their lives.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The topic of whether cheap air travel should be encouraged or discouraged due to its environmental impact has sparked a heated debate in recent years. On one hand, proponents of affordable air travel argue that it has broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds. This has given them the freedom to explore new destinations, experience different cultures, and connect with people from all walks of life. Cheap air fares have democratized travel, making it accessible to a larger segment of the population.On the other hand, critics of cheap air travel argue that it comes at a significant environmental cost. The proliferation of cheap flights has led to a significant increase in air travel, resulting in a substantial rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Burning plane fuel releases carbon dioxide into the environment, which contributes to global warming and climate change. This has severe consequences, including more frequent natural disasters, rising sea levels, and devastating heatwaves.In my opinion, while the benefits of affordable air travel cannot be ignored, the environmental costs associated with it cannot be dismissed either. A balance needs to be struck between the two. Governments and airlines can work together to implement measures that reduce the environmental impact of air travel, such as investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft, implementing carbon offsetting schemes, and encouraging sustainable aviation practices. Additionally, consumers can be incentivized to choose greener options, such as trains or buses, for shorter distances.Ultimately, it is not a question of either promoting or discouraging cheap air travel, but rather about making conscious choices that minimize its negative impacts. By adopting a more sustainable approach to air travel, we can ensure that the benefits of affordable air travel are not offset by the costs to our planet.
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;The debate on whether governments should allocate more funds to improve roads and highways or public transportation has been ongoing. In my opinion, governments should prioritize spending on public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and subways. This decision is primarily driven by the need to address the problems caused by the rising number of private cars on the roads.First and foremost, public transportation helps reduce the amount of resources used for transportation. With more people relying on public transport, the number of private cars on the road decreases, leading to a reduction in fuel consumption and the strain on infrastructure. This, in turn, helps to conserve energy and minimize the economic burden of maintaining and expanding road networks.Another significant advantage of investing in public transportation is its role in mitigating air pollution. Private cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which have severe environmental and health implications. By providing a reliable and efficient public transportation system, governments can encourage people to switch from private cars to public transport, thereby reducing emissions and creating a healthier environment.Furthermore, public transportation is significantly safer than private car travel. According to the National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private car travel. This statistic highlights the importance of investing in public transportation, not only for environmental and economic reasons but also for the safety and well-being of citizens.In conclusion, while investing in roads and highways is important, governments should prioritize spending on public transportation systems. By doing so, they can address the problems associated with private car usage, conserve resources, reduce air pollution, and ensure the safety of their citizens.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;The debate over whether students should study alone or in groups has been ongoing. While some students benefit from studying in groups, I personally prefer to study individually. This preference stems from my experience that studying alone helps me concentrate more effectively.Studying in groups can be beneficial for some students, as it allows them to share ideas, discuss complex topics, and learn from one another. Group study sessions can also foster a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, which can be motivating and engaging. For instance, group projects often require students to work together towards a common goal, promoting collaboration and communication skills. However, for me, the distractions and social interactions that come with group studying hinder my ability to focus on the material.In contrast, studying individually enables me to concentrate more intently on the subject matter. Without the distractions of group conversations or the need to coordinate with others, I can delve deeper into the material and absorb the information more efficiently. This focused approach to learning has allowed me to better understand and retain complex concepts, leading to improved academic performance.Moreover, studying alone is an essential aspect of building one's personality. When we study individually, we are encouraged to be more responsible and independent. For example, completing homework assignments on our own promotes self-motivation and accountability. By relying solely on ourselves to complete tasks, we develop a stronger work ethic and a greater sense of personal accomplishment. Additionally, individual studying allows us to discover our own learning style and pace, enabling us to adapt and refine our approach to learning over time.In conclusion, while some students may thrive in group study settings, I firmly believe that individual studying is the most effective approach for me. The ability to concentrate more intently and the opportunity to build my personality through independent learning make individual studying the preferred choice for my academic pursuits.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";The debate about the impact of human activity on the Earth has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While some argue that human activity has made the Earth a better place to live, I firmly believe that our actions are harming the planet. In my opinion, the overwhelming evidence suggests that human activity is polluting the environment, exhausting natural resources, and threatening the livelihoods of other species.One of the most pressing concerns is the pollution caused by human activities. The rampant use of plastics, chemicals, and fossil fuels has led to the contamination of our air, water, and soil. For instance, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a massive collection of plastic debris in the Pacific Ocean, is a stark reminder of the devastating impact of human carelessness. Moreover, the burning of fossil fuels has resulted in the release of greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change and its associated problems.Furthermore, human activity is rapidly depleting natural resources, such as oil, coal, and water. The unsustainable extraction and consumption of these resources have severe consequences, including the destruction of ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity. For example, the drilling for oil in the Arctic has disrupted the habitats of polar bears and other species, pushing them to the brink of extinction.In addition to environmental degradation, human activity is also endangering the lives of other species. Deforestation, habitat destruction, and hunting have pushed many species to the edge of extinction. The tragic loss of species, such as the dodo and the passenger pigeon, serves as a poignant reminder of the devastating impact of human actions.In conclusion, while some may argue that human activity has improved the Earth, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that our actions are causing irreparable harm to the planet. It is imperative that we take immediate action to mitigate the effects of pollution, resource depletion, and species endangerment. By adopting sustainable practices and reducing our ecological footprint, we can work towards preserving the beauty and diversity of our planet for future generations.
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";When faced with the decision of allocating funds to either support the arts or protect the environment, I firmly believe that the company should choose to protect the environment. In today's world, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever, and the need for conservation efforts has never been more pressing. If we didn't take harsh measures now, we may never have the opportunity to do so in the future.Supporting environmental protection is not only a moral imperative, but it is also a sound business strategy. In an era where consumers are increasingly environmentally conscious, supporting conservation efforts can be a powerful method of advertising. By allocating funds to protect the environment, the company can demonstrate its commitment to corporate social responsibility and enhance its public image. This, in turn, can lead to increased customer loyalty, improved brand reputation, and ultimately, increased revenue.Furthermore, conservation efforts can have a direct impact on the quality of life for individuals and communities. By protecting natural resources, conserving biodiversity, and mitigating the effects of climate change, we can create a healthier and more sustainable environment for future generations. This, in turn, can lead to a higher standard of living, as people are able to live in harmony with nature and enjoy the many benefits that a healthy ecosystem provides.In contrast, while supporting the arts is important for cultural enrichment and community development, it is not as critical or time-sensitive as environmental protection. The arts will continue to thrive and evolve, regardless of the company's decision. However, the environment will not recover from the damage that has been done if we do not take immediate action.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the company should choose to protect the environment. Not only is it a moral obligation, but it is also a sound business strategy and a necessary step towards creating a sustainable future for all.
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;In the modern workplace, collaboration and teamwork are essential to achieving organizational goals. As we interact with diverse individuals in our jobs, it's crucial to identify the key characteristics of a good co-worker. In my opinion, the three most important characteristics of a co-worker are cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.Firstly, cooperation is vital in a team-based work environment. When co-workers cooperate, they can share ideas, divide tasks, and work towards a common objective. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes, leading to decreased productivity and a toxic work atmosphere. For instance, in a marketing team, cooperation among members is necessary to launch a successful campaign. Each member should contribute their expertise, whether it's graphic design, content creation, or data analysis. Without cooperation, the campaign may not reach its full potential, and the team's efforts may go to waste.Secondly, trustworthiness is essential in building strong working relationships. A trustworthy co-worker is reliable, honest, and transparent. They keep their promises, maintain confidentiality, and admit their mistakes. When we trust our co-workers, we feel secure in sharing our ideas and opinions, leading to open communication and constructive feedback. For example, in a sales team, trustworthiness among members is crucial in sharing customer information and closing deals. If team members do not trust each other, they may withhold critical information, leading to lost sales and damaged customer relationships.Lastly, fellowship is vital in creating a positive and supportive work environment. A co-worker with fellowship is approachable, empathetic, and willing to lend a helping hand. They celebrate team successes and provide emotional support during difficult times. When we feel a sense of fellowship with our co-workers, we are more motivated, engaged, and committed to our jobs. For instance, in a software development team, fellowship among members is essential in coping with tight deadlines and debugging stressful issues. If team members do not show fellowship, they may feel isolated and unsupported, leading to burnout and decreased job satisfaction.In conclusion, cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship are the three most important characteristics of a co-worker. These traits are essential in building strong working relationships, achieving organizational goals, and creating a positive work environment. By embracing these characteristics, we can become better team players, enhance our job satisfaction, and contribute to our organization's success.
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;In the digital age, the world has witnessed a significant shift in the way people learn. Online classes have become increasingly popular, and their relevance in today's society cannot be overstated. This phenomenon raises an essential question: should online computer classes replace traditional classroom learning? In this essay, we will explore this topic and discuss the pros and cons of such a transition.On one hand, online computer classes offer unparalleled flexibility and accessibility. Students can learn at their own pace, from the comfort of their own homes, and at any time that suits them. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for working professionals, parents, and individuals living in remote areas with limited access to educational institutions. Online classes also provide an opportunity for students to access a vast array of courses and degree programs that may not be available locally.On the other hand, there are concerns that online learning may lack the social interaction and human element that traditional classroom learning provides. Face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers is essential for students' emotional and social development. Moreover, some students may require the structure and discipline that a traditional classroom setting provides to stay motivated and focused.Despite these concerns, I firmly believe that online computer classes can effectively replace classroom learning in certain contexts. For instance, in the field of computer science and programming, online classes can provide students with real-time feedback, interactive coding exercises, and access to a vast array of resources and tools. Moreover, online classes can be tailored to meet the specific needs of individual students, providing a more personalized learning experience.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the effectiveness of online learning, I believe that online computer classes can be a viable alternative to traditional classroom learning. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that online classes will become even more sophisticated and effective. Ultimately, the decision to replace classroom learning with online computer classes depends on the specific needs and circumstances of individual students.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The debate on whether university students should be required to attend classes has been a longstanding issue. While some argue that mandatory attendance is necessary for academic success, I firmly believe that students should have the freedom to choose whether or not to attend classes. This autonomy not only enhances the quality of student life but also boosts learning motivation, teaches valuable life skills, and offers flexibility.When students are allowed to make their own decisions about attending classes, they are more likely to take ownership of their learning. This freedom gives them the opportunity to develop time management skills, prioritize tasks, and set goals, all of which are essential for success in the real world. By not being forced to attend every lecture, students can allocate their time more efficiently, focus on areas that interest them the most, and engage in self-directed learning. As a result, their motivation to learn increases, leading to a more fulfilling academic experience.Moreover, having the freedom to choose when to attend classes teaches students important life skills, such as responsibility and accountability. When students are not required to attend every lecture, they must take responsibility for staying on top of their coursework and meeting deadlines. This helps them develop a sense of accountability, which is crucial for success in their future careers.In addition, not requiring students to attend classes provides them with the flexibility to balance their academic and personal responsibilities. Students may need to attend to family or work obligations, and the freedom to miss classes when necessary allows them to do so without penalty. This flexibility is particularly important for students who may be balancing work and study, or those who have family commitments.In conclusion, allowing university students to choose whether or not to attend classes is beneficial for their overall academic experience. It enhances the quality of student life, boosts learning motivation, teaches valuable life skills, and offers flexibility. By giving students the autonomy to make their own decisions about attendance, universities can foster a more responsible, motivated, and well-rounded student body.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;When it comes to choosing a place to call home, people are often divided between the charm of small towns and the hustle and bustle of big cities. After careful consideration, I would prefer to live in a small town, and I firmly believe that this choice has numerous advantages that make it an ideal choice for me.First and foremost, small towns offer a better quality of life. The weather is generally more pleasant, with cleaner air and fewer extreme weather conditions. This, in turn, contributes to a healthier lifestyle, as people are more inclined to engage in outdoor activities and enjoy nature. Furthermore, small towns usually have better facilities, such as community centers, parks, and local shops, which foster a sense of community and make life easier and more enjoyable.Another significant advantage of small towns is the lower cost of living. In big cities, the cost of living is notoriously high, with expensive housing, food, and transportation costs eating into one's budget. In contrast, small towns offer a more affordable lifestyle, where people can enjoy a comfortable standard of living without breaking the bank. Additionally, the cost of living is not the only concern in every society, but in small towns, people are more likely to know each other and have better relationships, which can lead to better deals and a stronger sense of community.Lastly, small towns offer a sense of belonging and connection that is often lacking in big cities. In big cities, people often feel alone and anonymous, with few opportunities to connect with others. In contrast, small towns offer a tight-knit community where people know and support each other, which can lead to a more fulfilling and happier life.In conclusion, while big cities have their advantages, I firmly believe that small towns offer a better quality of life, lower cost of living, and a sense of belonging that makes them an ideal choice for me.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. This phenomenon has sparked debates on whether this trend is beneficial or not. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this trend and argue that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.On the one hand, the reasons behind this trend are multifaceted. Cities offer a wider range of job opportunities, higher salaries, and better career prospects compared to rural areas. Additionally, cities are often equipped with better educational facilities, such as universities and research institutions, which attract young people seeking higher education. Furthermore, the allure of city life, with its vibrant culture, entertainment, and social opportunities, is a significant draw for young people seeking a more exciting and independent lifestyle.On the other hand, I personally do not approve of this trend due to its negative effects on the quality of life and the environment. The influx of young people to cities has led to overcrowding, increased competition for resources, and a higher cost of living. This can result in a lower quality of life, with many young people struggling to make ends meet and facing increased stress levels. Moreover, the mass migration to cities has significant environmental implications, such as increased pollution, waste, and strain on natural resources.In conclusion, while the reasons behind the trend of young people moving from rural areas to cities are understandable, I firmly believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. The negative effects on the quality of life and the environment are significant concerns that need to be addressed. Governments and policymakers should consider implementing policies to develop rural areas, providing more job opportunities and better educational facilities, to stem the tide of migration and create a more sustainable and equitable distribution of population.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, understanding the basics of economics is more crucial than ever. With the increasing complexities of the global economy, I strongly agree that high school students should take a course on basic economics. Not only does this equip them with essential life skills, but it also lays the groundwork for their future academic pursuits and professional endeavors.In today's community, the economy has become an integral part of our daily lives. The decisions we make as consumers, workers, and citizens have significant impacts on the world around us. By introducing high school students to basic economics, we empower them to navigate this complex landscape with confidence. The earlier we expose students to economic concepts, the more skillful they will be in making informed choices about their financial futures, careers, and societal contributions.Moreover, taking a basic economics course in high school can significantly benefit students when they transition to college. Many college majors, such as business, finance, and international relations, build upon fundamental economic principles. By having a solid understanding of these concepts beforehand, students will be better equipped to excel in their chosen fields. Additionally, the critical thinking and analytical skills developed through studying economics will serve them well in a wide range of academic pursuits.Furthermore, understanding basic economics can also help students develop a deeper appreciation for the social and cultural contexts in which they live. By recognizing the economic systems that shape their community, they can become more engaged and active citizens. In conclusion, incorporating basic economics into high school curricula is a forward-thinking move that will benefit students in countless ways. It is an investment in their future, preparing them to succeed in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The notion that university education should be limited to the most academically gifted students has sparked a contentious debate. While some argue that this approach would foster a more competitive and intellectually stimulating environment, I firmly believe that university education should be accessible to a broader range of students.On one hand, outstanding academic students are indeed eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. These individuals have demonstrated exceptional academic prowess and would undoubtedly thrive in a university setting. However, restricting university education to only the very best would mean that many other students, who may not have excelled academically but possess other valuable talents, would be denied the opportunity to develop their skills.University is not just about academic studies, but also a place to nurture artistic talent, develop soft skills, and foster personal growth. Many students who may not have been top achievers in school discover their true potential in university, where they are exposed to a diverse range of courses, extracurricular activities, and networking opportunities. By limiting university education to only the most academically gifted, we risk stifling the creative and innovative potential of students who may not have excelled in traditional academic settings.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. While it may lead to a more competitive and intellectually rigorous environment, it would also mean that many students who have the potential to excel in other areas would be denied the opportunity to develop their talents. I firmly believe that university education should be accessible to a broad range of students, regardless of their academic background. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and diverse learning environment that values the unique strengths and talents of all students.
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. This has sparked a debate about the most effective way to allocate a country's health budget, with some arguing that a larger portion should be diverted from treatment to health education and preventative measures. In this essay, we will explore the validity of this statement and argue that a greater proportion of the budget should indeed be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment.On one hand, investing in health education and preventative measures can have long-term benefits for the overall health and wellbeing of a population. By educating citizens about healthy lifestyles, disease prevention, and early detection, governments can reduce the burden on the healthcare system and prevent illnesses from arising in the first place. For instance, anti-smoking campaigns and initiatives promoting physical activity have been shown to be highly effective in reducing the incidence of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. Moreover, preventative measures such as vaccinations and screenings can help detect and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, thereby reducing the need for costly treatments.On the other hand, some may argue that diverting funds from treatment to prevention would leave those already suffering from illnesses without access to the care they need. However, this is a short-sighted view, as investing in prevention would ultimately lead to a reduction in the number of people requiring treatment in the future. Furthermore, preventative measures can also help reduce healthcare costs in the long run, as a healthier population would require fewer medical interventions.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment. While it is essential to provide adequate treatment for those in need, investing in health education and preventative measures can have far-reaching benefits for the overall health and wellbeing of a population. By prioritizing prevention, governments can create a sustainable healthcare system that promotes the health and prosperity of their citizens.
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;"The notion of removing non-academic subjects from school syllabi to prioritize academic success has sparked intense debate. While some argue that focusing solely on academics will lead to better grades, I firmly disagree. Non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery, are equally essential for a student's holistic development.Physical education, in particular, plays a vital role in promoting students' physical and mental well-being. If it were to be removed from the syllabus, there would be considerable negative effects on students' health. Regular physical activity has been proven to reduce the risk of obesity, improve concentration, and boost self-esteem. Without physical education, students would be more likely to lead sedentary lifestyles, leading to a plethora of health problems. Moreover, physical education provides a platform for students to develop teamwork and communication skills, which are invaluable in all aspects of life.Schools have a responsibility to develop their students into well-rounded individuals, equipped with a broad range of skills and knowledge. Non-academic subjects provide a unique opportunity for students to explore their interests and talents, which may not be evident in academic subjects. Cookery, for instance, teaches students about nutrition, meal planning, and budgeting, all of which are essential life skills.Success in life requires more than academic knowledge; it demands practical life skills, such as problem-solving, adaptability, and time management. Non-academic subjects provide students with hands-on experiences, allowing them to develop these skills in a fun and engaging environment. By removing these subjects, schools would be neglecting their duty to provide students with a comprehensive education.In conclusion, non-academic subjects are not dispensable extras, but rather an integral part of a student's educational journey. They provide students with essential life skills, promote physical and mental well-being, and help develop well-rounded individuals. Schools should prioritize a balanced curriculum, one that values both academic and non-academic subjects, to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in all aspects of life."
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When people move to another country, they are often faced with a difficult choice: whether to follow the customs of their new home or hold on to the traditions of their native land. This decision can have a significant impact on their ability to assimilate into their new surroundings and maintain their cultural identity.On one hand, following the customs of the new country can make the transition to a new life much easier. By adopting local traditions and practices, immigrants can quickly become an integral part of their new community. This can lead to stronger social connections, improved job prospects, and a greater sense of belonging. For instance, in a country where greeting people with a handshake is the norm, an immigrant who adopts this custom will be more likely to build relationships with their new colleagues and neighbors.On the other hand, some people may prefer to maintain their own customs and traditions, even in a foreign land. While this can be a great way to preserve cultural heritage and maintain a sense of identity, it can also lead to social isolation and difficulties integrating into the new society. When people insist on keeping their own customs and refuse to accept the new ones, they may be seen as a separate group, rather than as part of the broader community. For example, if an immigrant from a country where the traditional greeting is a bow, they may struggle to connect with locals if they insist on maintaining this custom in a country where it is not widely practiced.Personally, I believe that adopting the customs of the new country is the better choice. Not only does it facilitate integration and social connections, but it also shows respect for the culture and traditions of the host country. However, it is also important to maintain some cultural heritage and traditions, as this can provide a sense of comfort and continuity in a new and unfamiliar environment. Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance between adapting to the new customs and preserving one's own cultural identity.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;When it comes to achieving success, the debate over whether teamwork or independent work is more important has sparked intense discussion. While teamwork is undoubtedly crucial in many aspects of life, I firmly believe that the ability to work independently is more significant. In today's academic and professional landscape, being able to work alone is a vital skill that can make all the difference in achieving brilliant results.One compelling reason for this is that many assessments and evaluations are designed to test individual skills and knowledge. For instance, standardized tests, such as the SAT or ACT, do not allow team collaboration. To excel in these exams and secure a spot in a prestigious college or university, one must be able to work independently and rely on their own abilities. Similarly, final exams in school often require students to sit alone and demonstrate their understanding of the subject matter without any assistance. In these situations, the ability to focus, think critically, and solve problems on one's own is essential.Furthermore, independent work allows individuals to take ownership of their projects and ideas, which can lead to a greater sense of accomplishment and motivation. When working alone, one can also develop problem-solving skills, think creatively, and make decisions without needing to consult others. This autonomy can be particularly beneficial in fields like research, writing, and art, where originality and innovation are highly valued.In contrast, while teamwork is important in many industries, such as business, technology, and healthcare, it is often built on the foundation of individual skills and knowledge. In other words, team members must be able to contribute their unique expertise and perspectives to the group, which requires a certain level of independence and self-sufficiency.In conclusion, although teamwork is undoubtedly important, I believe that the ability to work independently is more significant. By developing this skill, individuals can achieve brilliant results, take ownership of their projects, and cultivate problem-solving skills, creativity, and motivation. As the academic and professional worlds continue to evolve, it is essential that we prioritize the development of independent work skills to succeed in an increasingly competitive and complex environment.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";Title: The Importance of Diversifying Hobbies and Physical Activities from One's WorkIn today's fast-paced world, the idea of work-life balance has become increasingly important. While some people believe that one should solely focus on their job, I strongly disagree. Engaging in hobbies and physical activities that differ from one's profession is essential for maintaining a healthy mind and body. In this essay, I will argue that having hobbies and doing physical activities that are distinct from one's work is crucial for overall well-being.On one hand, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Regular exercise and physical activity have been proven to improve cardiovascular health, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and boost mood. Moreover, engaging in hobbies that are not related to one's work can provide a sense of accomplishment and pride, which can translate to other areas of life. For instance, a software engineer who enjoys painting in their free time can experience a sense of fulfillment from creating something with their own hands.On the other hand, doing the same thing for a long time can be boring and lead to burnout. Having hobbies can refresh our minds and provide a much-needed break from the monotony of daily routine. For example, a teacher who spends most of their day speaking in front of a classroom can find solace in writing poetry or playing a musical instrument. Playing a musical instrument, in particular, is a great way to express emotions and relieve stress. When we feel depressed or pressured, music can be a healthy outlet for our emotions.In conclusion, having hobbies and doing physical activities that are different from one's work is essential for maintaining a healthy mind and body. It provides a sense of balance, accomplishment, and fulfillment. It also offers a much-needed break from the daily routine and can be a healthy outlet for emotions. I strongly believe that everyone should prioritize having hobbies and doing physical activities that bring them joy and fulfillment, regardless of their profession.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;The debate over whether governments should prioritize improving roads and highways or public transportation has been ongoing for years. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noise, and casualties for a long time, and from my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways. There are three crucial reasons that support this argument.Firstly, improving roads and highways can significantly reduce traffic congestion, which is a major contributor to pollution and noise pollution. When roads are in good condition and well-maintained, traffic can flow smoothly, reducing the time spent idling and minimizing the emission of harmful gases. Additionally, improved roads can accommodate more vehicles, reducing the likelihood of accidents and casualties. For instance, studies have shown that every dollar invested in road maintenance generates a return of approximately three dollars in reduced vehicle maintenance costs, reduced traffic congestion, and improved safety.Secondly, improving roads and highways can have a direct impact on economic growth. Good road infrastructure is essential for the transportation of goods and services, and its improvement can increase trade, commerce, and tourism. In many developing countries, poor road conditions hinder economic development by making it difficult to transport goods to markets, leading to losses and reduced economic opportunities. By improving roads and highways, governments can create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and improve living standards.Lastly, improving roads and highways is a more feasible and cost-effective solution compared to improving public transportation. While public transportation is essential for urban mobility, its improvement requires significant investment in infrastructure, including tracks, trains, and stations. In contrast, improving roads and highways can be done incrementally, with smaller investments in maintenance and upgrading. This makes it a more practical solution for many countries, especially those with limited financial resources.In conclusion, from my perspective, improving roads and highways is the most viable solution to the problems of pollution, noise, and casualties. By reducing traffic congestion, promoting economic growth, and providing a cost-effective solution, governments can create a safer, more sustainable, and more prosperous environment for their citizens.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;The quest for knowledge and understanding of life has been a perpetual pursuit for individuals across cultures and generations. There are two primary ways of acquiring insight into life: one is through the guidance of family and friends, and the other is by navigating personal experiences. In my opinion, both methods are valuable, as they possess unique benefits that complement each other.On one hand, seeking advice from family and friends offers a pragmatic approach to understanding life. Their experiences, successes, and setbacks provide valuable lessons that can help individuals avoid pitfalls and make informed decisions. This approach is more realistic, as it is grounded in the experiences of those who have traversed similar paths. Family and friends can offer emotional support, practical wisdom, and a unique perspective that can help shape one's worldview.On the other hand, learning through personal experience is a more immersive and transformative approach. By facing challenges and overcoming obstacles, individuals develop resilience, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Personal experiences also foster a deeper understanding of oneself, including strengths, weaknesses, and values. This approach allows individuals to develop their own perspective, unfiltered by the biases of others.While both methods are beneficial, I believe that learning through personal experience is more effective. Personal experiences provide a unique opportunity for self-discovery and growth, allowing individuals to develop their own voice and perspective. Furthermore, the lessons learned through personal experience are more likely to be retained, as they are often accompanied by strong emotions and memories. In conclusion, while seeking advice from family and friends is valuable, learning through personal experience offers a more comprehensive and lasting understanding of life.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;Childhood is often regarded as a carefree and joyful period of life, full of laughter, exploration, and discovery. In my opinion, childhood is indeed the happiest time of a person's life. During this stage, most people are happier than in adulthood, and this is due to the simplicity and innocence of childhood.A child's daily life is typically filled with routine activities such as school, playing, and sleeping. However, it is in these mundane tasks that children find joy and contentment. Without the burdens of adulthood, such as financial stress and relationship problems, children are free to enjoy the little things in life. They find happiness in playing with friends, learning new things in school, and spending time with family.Moreover, people are most creative when they were children. Childhood is a time of imagination and curiosity, where children are encouraged to explore and express themselves. Many artists, writers, and musicians attribute their creative spark to their childhood experiences. The freedom to dream and imagine without the constraints of reality is a unique aspect of childhood that fosters creativity and innovation.In addition, children are also more resilient and adaptable, able to bounce back from setbacks and disappointments with ease. They are not yet burdened by the complexities and expectations of adulthood, and are able to live in the moment, unencumbered by worries about the past or future.In conclusion, childhood is a special time of life, full of wonder, curiosity, and joy. While it is true that adulthood has its own rewards and happiness, I firmly believe that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. The simplicity, creativity, and resilience of childhood make it a time of unparalleled happiness and contentment.
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;The advent of modern technology has revolutionized the way people prepare food, making it easier, faster, and more convenient. With the proliferation of kitchen appliances such as microwaves, toasters, and slow cookers, cooking has become a breeze, transforming the way people live and interact with food.One significant impact of this change is the liberation of housewives from the tedious and time-consuming cooking process. Gone are the days of spending hours in the kitchen, slaving away over a hot stove, preparing meals from scratch. With the aid of modern appliances, cooking time has been significantly reduced, freeing up time for more meaningful pursuits. Housewives can now devote their time to personal interests, hobbies, or even pursue careers, leading to a more fulfilling and balanced life.Moreover, the ease of food preparation has also led to a shift in eating habits. People are now more inclined to cook at home, rather than relying on takeouts or restaurant meals. This has resulted in healthier eating habits, as home-cooked meals tend to be lower in calories, salt, and sugar. Additionally, with the help of slow cookers and pressure cookers, people can now prepare a wide variety of meals, including soups, stews, and casseroles, which are not only delicious but also nutritious.In conclusion, the ease of food preparation brought about by technological advances has indeed improved the way people live. It has liberated housewives from the drudgery of cooking, enabled healthier eating habits, and opened up new culinary possibilities. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that food preparation will become even more convenient, further transforming the way we live and interact with food.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;The age-old debate about whether young adults should strive for independence from their parents as soon as possible or live with their families for a longer period has been a topic of discussion for many years. In my opinion, living with one's family for a longer time is the better option. There are several reasons that support this stance, including the opportunity to create lasting memories, the financial benefits, and the invaluable advice that parents can offer.One of the most significant advantages of living with one's family for a longer period is the opportunity to create lasting memories with one's parents. These are the years when young adults are transitioning into independent individuals, and having their parents around can make a significant difference in their lives. For instance, they can share meals together, go on family vacations, and engage in activities that bring them closer. These memories can last a lifetime and provide a sense of security and belonging.Another significant benefit of living with one's family for a longer period is the financial benefits. By living with their parents, young adults can save a substantial amount of money on rent, food, and other expenses. This can be especially helpful for students or individuals who are just starting their careers and may not have a stable income. According to various studies, young adults who live with their parents can save up to 50% of their income, which can be a significant amount.Additionally, living with one's family for a longer period provides young adults with the opportunity to seek advice from their parents. Parents have a wealth of experience and knowledge that they can share with their children, which can be invaluable in helping them make important life decisions. For example, they can provide guidance on career choices, relationships, and financial management.In conclusion, living with one's family for a longer period has several benefits, including the opportunity to create lasting memories, the financial benefits, and the invaluable advice that parents can offer. While independence is an essential aspect of growing up, it is not necessary to rush into it. By living with their parents for a longer period, young adults can set themselves up for success in life and create a strong foundation for their future.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;The role of zoos in modern society has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that they serve no useful purpose. However, I strongly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, zoos play a vital role in education, conservation, and tourism, making them an essential part of our community.Firstly, zoos are very crucial for learning. They provide a unique opportunity for people, especially children, to learn about different animal species, their habitats, and their behavior. By observing animals in a controlled environment, visitors can gain a deeper understanding of the natural world and develop a greater appreciation for wildlife. For instance, the Singapore Zoo offers educational programs and interactive exhibits that teach visitors about conservation efforts and the importance of protecting endangered species.Secondly, zoos play a significant role in helping animals out of extinction. Many zoos participate in breeding programs for endangered species, which helps to increase population numbers and release animals back into the wild. For example, the California Condor Recovery Program, which involves several zoos in the United States, has successfully increased the population of California condors from just 22 birds in the 1980s to over 500 today.Finally, zoos are a great tourist attraction, generating revenue and creating jobs for local communities. According to the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, over 700 million people visit zoos each year, making them one of the most popular tourist attractions globally. The Toronto Zoo, for instance, attracts over 1.3 million visitors annually, contributing significantly to the local economy.In conclusion, I firmly believe that zoos have a multitude of useful purposes. They provide a valuable learning experience, contribute to conservation efforts, and serve as a popular tourist attraction. Rather than dismissing zoos as unnecessary, we should recognize their importance and continue to support and improve them to ensure the well-being of both animals and humans.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;The role of parents in a child's life is undeniable, and their influence on a child's development is immense. In my opinion, parents are indeed the best teachers for young children, and I agree with this statement to a great extent.From the moment a child is born, parents are their first teachers, guiding them through the earliest stages of life. They teach babies how to walk, speak, and interact with the world around them. This early guidance lays the foundation for a child's future development, shaping their physical, emotional, and cognitive abilities. Moreover, parents play a significant role in molding their children's values and character, instilling in them the principles of good behavior and moral values.One of the primary reasons why parents are effective teachers is that they act out of love and a genuine desire to see their children succeed. They create a nurturing environment that fosters growth and learning, providing their children with the support and encouragement they need to thrive. Based on this love, parents strive to create optimal conditions for their children's development, preparing them for future challenges and opportunities. Whether it is providing access to education, extracurricular activities, or simply being present and involved in their lives, parents make sacrifices and investments in their children's future.In conclusion, parents are the best teachers for young children. Their early guidance, love, and dedication lay the foundation for a child's future success. As the first teachers, parents have a profound impact on their children's development, shaping their values, behavior, and abilities.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;The debate about the impact of television on young children has sparked intense discussion among parents, educators, and child development experts. While many people argue that television has a detrimental influence on children, I believe that, if used judiciously, the positive effects of television can outweigh the negative ones.On the one hand, it is undeniable that many television programs contain content that is not suitable for young children. Violence, explicit language, and mature themes can be damaging to a child's emotional and psychological well-being. Furthermore, excessive exposure to television can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health problems. These concerns have led many to conclude that television is a corrupting influence on young minds.On the other hand, I firmly believe that television can be a valuable tool for learning and development when used wisely. Educational programs such as Sesame Street, Blue's Clues, and National Geographic Kids can foster a love for learning, promote social skills, and encourage creativity. Moreover, documentaries and informative programs can broaden a child's understanding of the world, cultures, and histories. If parents and caregivers exercise discretion in selecting television content and limit screen time, children can reap numerous benefits from watching television.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the negative effects of television on young children, I disagree that it has an entirely bad influence. By using television programs judiciously and in moderation, children can enjoy a wide range of educational, informative, and entertaining content that can enrich their lives.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;The notion that businesses should hire employees for their entire lives has been a topic of debate among entrepreneurs and scholars. Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of work. However, from my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ workers for the whole of their life due to three main crucial reasons.First and foremost, hiring employees for their entire lives restricts their opportunities for personal and professional growth. In today's fast-paced and dynamic work environment, employees need to adapt to new technologies, skills, and industries to remain relevant. Lifetime employment can lead to stagnation, as employees may become complacent and lack the motivation to acquire new skills or pursue new opportunities. For instance, companies like Google and Microsoft encourage their employees to take sabbaticals or pursue side projects to foster innovation and creativity. This approach allows employees to recharge, explore new interests, and bring fresh ideas back to their work.Secondly, lifetime employment can lead to a lack of diversity and innovation within a company. When employees are hired for life, they may become entrenched in their ways of thinking and working, leading to a lack of new perspectives and ideas. Companies need to inject fresh talent and ideas to stay competitive, which is not possible when employees are hired for their entire lives. For example, companies like Airbnb and Uber have disrupted entire industries by bringing in new talent and ideas, which would not have been possible if they had hired employees for life.Lastly, hiring employees for their entire lives can be detrimental to a company's bottom line. With the rapidly changing business landscape, companies need to be agile and adaptable to respond to changing market conditions. Lifetime employment can lead to a rigid workforce that is not responsive to changing business needs. For instance, companies like Amazon and Tesla have been able to disrupt entire industries by being agile and responsive to changing market conditions, which would not have been possible with a rigid workforce.In conclusion, while the idea of hiring employees for their entire lives may seem appealing, it is a conservative and out-of-date approach that can restrict employee growth, lead to a lack of diversity and innovation, and be detrimental to a company's bottom line. Businesses would do better to adopt a more agile and adaptable approach to employment, one that allows employees to grow, innovate, and respond to changing business needs.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";The statement that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life is one that resonates with many people, and for good reason. In several aspects, childhood is indeed the happiest period of one's life. One of the primary reasons for this is the sense of wonder and curiosity that comes with experiencing the world for the first time.Childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most. Every new discovery, whether it be the beauty of a butterfly's wings or the magic of a fairy tale, is a source of amazement and delight. This innocence and openness to the world allows children to see things with fresh eyes, unjaded by the cynicism and disappointment that can come with age.Another great thing about childhood is the freedom to imagine and say what you think. Children are not bound by the same social conventions and expectations that govern adult behavior. They are free to dream, to create, and to express themselves without fear of judgment or reprisal. This freedom allows them to explore their creativity and individuality, and to develop a sense of self that is unencumbered by the pressures of adulthood.Furthermore, childhood is often a time of simplicity and joy, unencumbered by the worries and responsibilities that come with growing up. Children are able to find happiness in the smallest things, whether it be a game of tag, a bedtime story, or a family outing. They are able to live in the moment, untroubled by the concerns of the past or future.
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";Learning about the past has been a topic of debate, with some people believing that it has no value for those living in the present. They argue that time never stops, and as such, the past is irrelevant to our current lives. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. In fact, studying the past can provide invaluable lessons that can be applied to our present and future.One of the most significant reasons to learn about the past is to understand the mistakes that have been made. By analyzing historical events, we can identify patterns of behavior and decisions that led to negative outcomes. For instance, the tragic events of World War II serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of nationalism and prejudice. By learning from these mistakes, we can avoid repeating them in the present and future.On the other hand, the past is also filled with stories of success and achievement. By studying the lives of great leaders, scientists, and innovators, we can gain insights into the qualities and characteristics that contributed to their success. For example, the life of Marie Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, is a testament to the power of determination and hard work. By learning from her experiences, we can draw inspiration and guidance for our own endeavors.Furthermore, the past is a treasure trove of knowledge in various fields of study. From the scientific discoveries of ancient civilizations to the cultural achievements of past societies, there is a wealth of information that can inform and enrich our understanding of the world. By ignoring the past, we risk losing this knowledge and the valuable lessons it contains.In conclusion, learning about the past is essential for those living in the present. By studying the mistakes, successes, and knowledge of the past, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world and our place in it. Rather than ignoring the past, we should make full use of it, applying its lessons to build a brighter future for ourselves and generations to come.
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;The investment of governments in space exploration has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people believe that the money spent on space travel is a waste, while others think it is a necessary investment for the future of humanity. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save the living of humanity in the future.Space exploration, which was possible for humans in the 20th century, has led to numerous discoveries and advancements in technology. By exploring outer space, we can gain a deeper understanding of the universe and its potential dangers. For instance, asteroid impacts have caused mass extinctions in the past, and by monitoring near-Earth asteroids, we can prevent such disasters from happening again. Moreover, space exploration can provide us with valuable resources, such as minerals and energy sources, which can sustain human life for generations to come.Additionally, space exploration has been used as a tool for military power, especially during the Cold War era. However, this does not diminish its importance for the greater good of humanity. In fact, the technological advancements made through space exploration, such as GPS and telecommunications, have greatly benefited society as a whole.Furthermore, space exploration can also serve as a catalyst for international cooperation and peaceful resolution of conflicts. By working together to explore space, nations can put aside their differences and achieve common goals. This, in turn, can lead to greater global understanding and cooperation, ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole.In conclusion, while some may view the investment in space exploration as a luxury, I firmly believe that it is a necessary investment for the future of humanity. The potential benefits, from disaster prevention to resource discovery, and from technological advancements to international cooperation, make it a worthwhile endeavor.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";"The advent of television has revolutionized the way people consume information and entertainment, making it one of the greatest innovations of our time.

In fact, television has played a significant role in fostering communication and strengthening relationships among loved ones.Firstly, television provides a common platform for discussion and sharing of experiences. Families and friends can watch the same shows or news programs, generating topics for conversation and debate. For instance, popular TV shows like ""Game of Thrones"" or ""The Walking Dead"" have sparked numerous discussions and theories among fans, encouraging social interaction and bonding. Moreover, TV shows and movies often depict real-life scenarios, prompting viewers to reflect on their own relationships and experiences, thereby promoting empathy and understanding.Secondly, television has made it possible for people to connect with others across geographical distances. With the rise of video conferencing and live streaming, friends and family can now share experiences and communicate in real-time, regardless of their physical location. For example, international sporting events like the Olympics or the World Cup have brought people together, transcending borders and fostering a sense of global community.Finally, television has also provided a platform for families to spend quality time together. Watching TV shows or movies can be a fun and engaging activity, allowing family members to bond and create shared memories. In fact, many families have made TV time a part of their daily routine, often discussing their favorite shows over dinner or during family gatherings.In conclusion, while some people may argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and families, I strongly believe that it has done the opposite. By providing a common platform for discussion, enabling long-distance connections, and fostering quality family time, television has actually strengthened relationships and promoted communication among loved ones."
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;The argument surrounding whether letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship is a complex one. On one hand, intervening can potentially prevent harm or negative consequences, but on the other hand, it may lead to resentment and damage to the relationship. After careful consideration, I agree that letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion.Firstly, letting a friend make a mistake allows them to learn and grow from their experiences. When we make mistakes, we often learn valuable lessons that help us become wiser and more cautious in the future. By intervening, we may deprive our friends of the opportunity to gain this valuable experience and insight. For instance, if a friend is considering quitting their job without having another one lined up, we may be tempted to advise them against it. However, by letting them make this mistake, they may learn the importance of planning and preparation, which can be a valuable lesson for their future career.Secondly, taking action that risks destroying a friendship can be damaging to the relationship in the long run. When we intervene in our friends' decisions, they may feel judged, criticized, or even betrayed. This can lead to feelings of resentment and mistrust, which can be difficult to repair. For example, if a friend is considering investing in a business venture that we think is risky, we may advise them against it. However, if they feel strongly about the investment, our advice may be seen as meddling, leading to a rift in the friendship.
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;In my view, it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare for their adult life for several reasons. Firstly, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. This helps them learn the value of money and understand that it is earned through hard work and dedication, rather than simply given to them. Moreover, having a part-time job teaches teenagers the importance of time management and balancing responsibilities. They learn to prioritize tasks, meet deadlines, and juggle multiple commitments, essential skills for success in adulthood.Another significant benefit of having a part-time job is that it instills a sense of responsibility and accountability. For instance, if a student is frequently late for work, the company may reduce their payment or even fire them. Under these circumstances, they will learn that they have to obey the rules and take responsibility for their work. This helps build their character and teaches them to be punctual, reliable, and dependable. Additionally, a part-time job provides an opportunity for teenagers to develop important life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. They learn to interact with people of different ages, backgrounds, and personalities, preparing them for the diverse and dynamic nature of the adult world.Furthermore, having a part-time job can also enhance a teenager's resume and college applications. Many universities and employers value applicants with work experience, as it demonstrates their ability to balance work and academic responsibilities. In conclusion, encouraging teenage children to take a part-time job is one of the best ways for parents to help them prepare for adult life. It teaches them valuable life skills, responsibility, and the importance of hard work, setting them up for success in their future careers.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;The debate about whether children should grow up in the countryside or in a big city has been ongoing for years. While some argue that the countryside offers a more peaceful and serene environment for children to grow, I firmly believe that it is better for children to grow up in a big city. There are several reasons that support this argument.Firstly, big cities offer a diverse and vibrant environment where children are exposed to people from different cultures, ethnicities, and backgrounds. This exposure helps shape their worldview, broadens their perspectives, and teaches them valuable lessons about tolerance and understanding. In contrast, the countryside can be isolating, with limited opportunities for socialization.Secondly, cities provide a wide range of activities, amenities, and services that cater to children's physical, emotional, and intellectual development. From parks and playgrounds to museums and libraries, cities offer endless possibilities for children to learn, play, and explore. In contrast, the countryside often lacks these amenities, forcing children to rely on limited resources and their own imagination for entertainment.Moreover, the countryside can be a breeding ground for gossip and rumors, where everyone knows each other's business. This can be stifling for children, who need freedom to make mistakes, learn from them, and grow without the weight of constant scrutiny. In a city, children can enjoy a relatively anonymous existence, free from the prying eyes of neighbors and the constraints of small-town life.Personally, if I were to have children, I would want them to grow up in a city. I believe that the city offers the perfect balance of opportunities, diversity, and freedom that are essential for a child's development. While the countryside may offer a peaceful environment, I believe that the benefits of city life far outweigh the drawbacks. In conclusion, while the countryside has its advantages, I firmly believe that it is better for children to grow up in a big city, where they can thrive, learn, and grow into well-rounded, open-minded individuals.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;I agree with the statement that parents are the best teachers. Parents have a profound impact on their children's lives, and their influence extends beyond the classroom. One of the primary reasons parents make excellent teachers is the power of their words. What parents say to their children has a lasting impact, carrying more weight than anything a friend or other adult could say. Children look up to their parents as role models and authorities, and their words are absorbed and internalized.Another significant advantage parents have is the amount of time they spend with their children. Typically, a child spends more time with their parents than with any other person, including teachers or peers. This extensive time allows parents to teach and guide their children in a way that no one else can. They can impart values, morals, and life skills through daily interactions, conversations, and shared experiences.Furthermore, children often mirror themselves on their parents, emulating their behavior, attitudes, and habits. This phenomenon is known as social learning theory, where children learn by observing and imitating their parents. Parents, therefore, have a unique opportunity to shape their children's character, work ethic, and relationships by modeling the behavior they wish to see in their child.In conclusion, parents are indeed the best teachers due to the significant influence they wield over their children's lives. Their words have power, they have ample time to teach and guide, and their children look to them as role models. By recognizing the importance of their role, parents can make a conscious effort to teach their children valuable lessons, values, and life skills, ultimately shaping them into capable, compassionate, and responsible individuals.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;"The advent of modern technology and industrialization has revolutionized the way people prepare and consume food. With the development of pre-packaged meals, microwave ovens, and a plethora of cooking gadgets, food has become easier to prepare than ever before. This change has undoubtedly improved the way people live in many aspects, but it also poses some concerns that need to be addressed.On the one hand, the ease of food preparation has saved people a significant amount of time and effort. With the availability of ready-to-cook meals and online grocery shopping, individuals can now allocate more time to other aspects of their lives, such as work, leisure, or personal development. Moreover, modern cooking techniques and ingredients have enabled people to create a wide variety of dishes that are not only delicious but also visually appealing. Food has become more than just a necessity; it has become an art form that brings people together and provides a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment.However, the convenience of modern food preparation also comes with a warning. Many industrial foods are high in unhealthy ingredients, such as preservatives, artificial flavorings, and excessive sugar and salt. Consuming these foods regularly can lead to a range of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, the over-reliance on pre-packaged meals can also result in a lack of essential nutrients and a diminished appreciation for traditional cooking methods.In conclusion, the development of easier food preparation has undoubtedly improved the way people live, providing more time, variety, and enjoyment. Nevertheless, it is crucial for individuals to be mindful of their food choices and strike a balance between convenience and health."
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The debate on whether students should be required to take regular standardized tests has been ongoing for years. While some argue that these tests are an unnecessary burden on students, others believe that they are essential in measuring a student's learning. In this essay, I will argue that students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning.First and foremost, standardized tests provide a fair and objective measure of a student's knowledge and understanding of a subject. Unlike other forms of assessment, such as classwork and projects, which can be subjective and biased, standardized tests ensure that all students are held to the same standards and are graded based on their performance alone. This is particularly important for teachers who rely heavily on exam results when grading their students. By administering regular standardized tests, teachers can get an accurate picture of a student's strengths and weaknesses, which informs their grading decisions.Another advantage of standardized tests is that they provide a common language and framework for measuring student learning. This allows teachers to compare student performance across different classrooms and schools, which is essential for identifying areas where students may need extra support. Furthermore, standardized tests help to prepare students for the rigors of higher education and the workforce, where they will be expected to perform well on standardized assessments.In conclusion, requiring students to take regular standardized tests is essential for ensuring that they are learning and meeting the expected standards. These tests provide a fair and objective measure of student knowledge, inform teacher grading decisions, and prepare students for the demands of higher education and the workforce. While some may argue that these tests are too stressful or burdensome, the benefits of standardized testing far outweigh the drawbacks.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";In today's world, where knowledge is power, a university education is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many aspiring scholars. The escalating costs of higher education have led to a surge in self-financed education, where students are forced to take on debt to pursue their academic dreams. However, I firmly believe that a university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars.The notion of free education has the potential to unlock the true potential of students who are eager to learn and contribute to society. When education is free, it inspires scholars to focus on their studies without the burden of financial constraints. This, in turn, fosters a culture of intellectual curiosity, creativity, and innovation, as students are empowered to explore their passions without worrying about the cost. Furthermore, free education promotes social mobility, as it provides opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to compete on an equal footing with their peers from more affluent families.In contrast, self-financed education can be a significant deterrent for many aspiring scholars, particularly those from low-income families. The weight of debt can stifle their enthusiasm and limit their career choices, as they are forced to prioritize high-paying jobs over their true interests. By providing free education, we can create a more equitable society where every individual has the chance to succeed, regardless of their financial background.In conclusion, I strongly agree that a university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars. It is an investment in the future of our society, and it has the potential to unlock the true potential of students, promote social mobility, and foster a culture of intellectual curiosity and innovation. By making education accessible to all, we can create a more enlightened, productive, and equitable society.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;The debate about whether university professors should prioritize research or education has been ongoing. While some argue that professors should focus more on educating students, I firmly believe that they should spend more time doing research. Professors are essentially teachers, and their primary responsibility is to impart knowledge to their students. However, there is another crucial aspect of their role that cannot be overlooked - conducting research.There are several reasons why I think professors should allocate more time to research. Firstly, research is essential for advancing knowledge in various fields. Professors are experts in their areas of specialization, and their research contributes significantly to the development of new ideas, theories, and innovations. By spending more time on research, professors can make groundbreaking discoveries that can benefit society as a whole.Secondly, research experience is vital for professors to stay updated with the latest developments in their field. If they are not actively engaged in research, their knowledge may become outdated, and they may not be able to provide their students with the most current and relevant information. By prioritizing research, professors can ensure that their teaching is informed by the latest research findings, making their classes more engaging and relevant.Thirdly, research is a key factor in a university's reputation and ranking. Universities that prioritize research are generally considered more prestigious and attractive to students, faculty, and funding agencies. By allocating more time to research, professors can contribute to their university's reputation and attract more resources, which can, in turn, benefit their students.In conclusion, while teaching is an essential part of a professor's role, I believe that they should spend more time doing research. Research is crucial for advancing knowledge, staying updated with the latest developments, and contributing to a university's reputation. By prioritizing research, professors can make a more significant impact on their field and provide their students with a more enriching educational experience.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;The impact of television and movies on people's behavior is a widely debated topic. While some argue that these forms of media have a positive influence, it is undeniable that they often have a more profound negative effect. In this essay, we will explore how television and movies shape our behavior, particularly highlighting the adverse consequences.On the one hand, television and movies can inspire and educate us. For instance, documentaries and historical dramas can raise awareness about significant social issues, promoting empathy and understanding. However, these positive influences are often overshadowed by the negative impacts of excessive screen time. The constant exposure to advertisements for unhealthy foods and drinks has led to a surge in junk food consumption, contributing to the growing obesity epidemic. Children and adults alike are enticed by the colorful packaging and catchy jingles, resulting in a rise in unhealthy eating habits.Furthermore, the rise of social media has been fueled by television and movies, which often portray unrealistic and glamorous lifestyles. This has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, as people spend more time staring at screens than engaging with friends and family. The fear of missing out (FOMO) and the pressure to present a perfect online persona have created a culture of isolation, where individuals prioritize their virtual lives over real-life connections.In addition, the constant bombardment of idealized characters and celebrities on television and movies has led to a rise in people trying to emulate these unattainable standards. This has resulted in a loss of individuality, as people strive to conform to societal norms rather than embracing their unique qualities. The constant pursuit of an unrealistic beauty standard, for example, has led to a rise in body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem.In conclusion, while television and movies can have some positive influences, it is clear that they often have a more profound negative impact on people's behavior. By promoting unhealthy habits, isolating individuals, and encouraging the suppression of individuality, these forms of media have the power to shape our behavior in detrimental ways. It is essential to be aware of these influences and strive for a balanced and mindful approach to our media consumption.
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;When traveling to new places, many people make it a point to visit museums. While it may seem like an obvious activity for tourists, the reasons behind this inclination are multifaceted and worth exploring. In this essay, we will delve into the motivations behind visiting museums, highlighting the educational value, social opportunities, and cultural significance.One of the primary reasons people visit museums is to gain a deeper understanding of the local history and culture. Museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, allowing visitors to gain a more nuanced appreciation of the region. For instance, a visit to the Louvre in Paris would offer insights into French art and history, while a trip to the National Museum of China in Beijing would provide a comprehensive look at Chinese civilization. By immersing themselves in these exhibits, visitors can develop a more informed perspective on the local customs, traditions, and ways of life.Visiting museums also offers an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals and establish new relationships. While exploring exhibits, visitors can engage in conversations with fellow travelers and locals, fostering connections and friendships. For example, striking up a conversation with a fellow art enthusiast in front of a famous painting can lead to a meaningful exchange of ideas and even a lasting friendship. Moreover, visiting museums can bring people the chance to make friends and participate in conversations, allowing them to engage with others who share similar interests.In conclusion, visiting museums is a popular activity among tourists due to its educational value, social opportunities, and cultural significance. By exploring the rich history and culture of a place, meeting fellow travelers, and engaging in meaningful conversations, museum-goers can create lasting memories and connections. Whether traveling alone or with others, visiting museums is an enriching experience that offers something for everyone.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"In today's fast-paced and crowded world, it's easy to get caught up in our own personal struggles and forget about the people around us. However, I strongly disagree with the statement that we should not expect people to be polite to others. Politeness is a fundamental aspect of human interaction that not only reflects our character but also has a profound impact on those around us.As the saying goes, ""a man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues."" A person with good manners is often perceived as respectful, considerate, and kind. They give others a fine personal impression, which can open doors to new opportunities and foster meaningful relationships. On the other hand, a person with poor manners can come across as rude, insensitive, and unapproachable.Politeness and tender words have the power to not only earn us a good reputation but also to uplift and encourage those around us. A simple ""please"" or ""thank you"" can go a long way in brightening someone's day. In a crowded and busy world, a kind word or gesture can be a beacon of hope and comfort to those who may be struggling. Moreover, politeness can have a ripple effect, inspiring others to pay it forward and creating a more positive and supportive community.In conclusion, politeness is not a luxury we can afford to discard in a busy and crowded world. On the contrary, it is a necessity that can make a significant difference in the lives of those around us. We should strive to maintain a culture of politeness and respect, even in the midst of chaos and hurry. By doing so, we can create a more harmonious and compassionate society where everyone feels valued and appreciated."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;"The age-old adage that ""when life gives you lemons, make lemonade"" resonates deeply with the notion that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Many people subscribe to the idea that some difficulties people encountered at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. From my point of view, I am in favor of the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their lives. For instance, a person who has experienced poverty may learn to appreciate the simple joys of life, such as having a warm meal or a comfortable place to sleep. This newfound appreciation can lead to a more fulfilling life, where one is not consumed by material possessions, but by the beauty of everyday experiences.Moreover, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of their ability to navigate through challenging situations. This sense of resilience can be a powerful tool in the face of adversity, allowing individuals to remain composed and focused, even in the most turbulent of times. For example, a student who struggled to learn a new language may initially feel frustrated, but with perseverance, they will develop a sense of determination and confidence that will serve them well in future academic pursuits.In conclusion, I firmly believe that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. By cherishing the little things and developing resilience, individuals can transform their struggles into stepping stones for success. As the ancient Greek philosopher, Heraclitus, once said, ""The way up and the way down are one and the same."" It is only by embracing our difficulties that we can truly appreciate the journey and reach our full potential."
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;The debate about whether life in a city is better than life in the countryside has been ongoing for centuries. While some people prefer the peace and tranquility of rural areas, others thrive in the hustle and bustle of urban life. In my opinion, life in a city is much better than life in the countryside due to its superior education system, abundant work opportunities, cultural diversity, and efficient communication.One of the primary advantages of city life is its access to quality education. Urban areas typically have better-funded schools, more experienced teachers, and a wider range of academic programs. This results in a more comprehensive education, preparing students for a successful career and a brighter future. In contrast, rural areas often struggle to provide the same level of educational resources, leaving students at a disadvantage.Another significant benefit of city life is the abundance of work opportunities. With a larger population and a more diverse economy, cities offer a wide range of jobs across various industries. This allows individuals to pursue their passions and interests, leading to greater job satisfaction and career advancement. In contrast, rural areas often have limited job opportunities, making it difficult for individuals to find employment that matches their skills and interests.Urban areas also boast a culturally diverse population, which enriches the lives of its citizens. With people from different backgrounds and ethnicities living together, cities become vibrant melting pots of traditions, customs, and ideas. This diversity fosters tolerance, understanding, and creativity, making cities exciting and dynamic places to live.In addition, cities have well-developed public transportation systems, with buses and trains running frequently and efficiently. This makes it easy for citizens to commute to work, school, or social events, connecting them to various parts of the city and beyond. While rural areas may have limited public transportation options, making it difficult for residents to access essential services and amenities.However, it is worth acknowledging that the countryside has its own unique advantages. The peaceful surroundings and natural beauty of rural areas make them ideal for rest and relaxation. The slower pace of life and stunning landscapes can be a welcome respite from the stresses of city life.In conclusion, while the countryside has its own charms, life in a city is generally better due to its superior education system, abundant work opportunities, cultural diversity, and efficient communication. Cities offer citizens a dynamic and exciting environment that fosters personal and professional growth, making them the preferred choice for many people.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;"The relationship between job, living environment, and happiness has long been debated. Some people argue that their job has a greater impact on their happiness, while others believe that their living environment plays a more significant role. The statement ""your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does"" is a topic of discussion. While I acknowledge that one's job can indeed bring happiness to some individuals, I firmly believe that living environment is more crucial to most people's overall happiness.In recent years, as people's living standards have improved, they have become increasingly affluent. As a result, they have shifted their focus from basic survival needs to mental requirements such as happiness. This shift in priorities has led to a growing awareness of the importance of both job satisfaction and living environment in contributing to one's overall happiness.While some individuals may find their job to be a significant source of happiness, I believe that living environment plays a more substantial role in shaping most people's happiness. A comfortable and secure living environment can provide a sense of stability and peace, which are essential for happiness. On the other hand, a job, no matter how fulfilling, can be stressful and demanding at times, which may negatively impact one's happiness. Furthermore, a good living environment can provide opportunities for socialization, community engagement, and access to amenities, all of which are vital components of happiness.In conclusion, while job satisfaction is important, I firmly believe that living environment has a greater impact on most people's happiness. A comfortable, secure, and supportive living environment is essential for overall well-being, and its importance should not be underestimated."
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;Communication is a fundamental aspect of human interaction, and in today's world, technology has transformed the way we connect with each other. With the rise of digital communication, people have various options to choose from, including voice mail, email, telephone, and face-to-face conversations. While each method has its own advantages, I personally prefer email as my primary means of communication, and I would like to explain why.Firstly, email offers convenience, which is essential in today's fast-paced world. With email, I can send and receive messages at any time and from any location, as long as I have an internet connection. This flexibility allows me to manage my time more efficiently, as I can respond to emails at my own pace, without being tied to a specific time or place. Whether I am at home, in the office, or on the go, email enables me to stay connected with others without being constrained by geographical or temporal limitations.Secondly, email allows for honest expression. When communicating in person or over the phone, it's easy to get caught up in the moment and say something that might be misinterpreted or regretted later. With email, I have the time to carefully craft my thoughts and choose my words, ensuring that my message is conveyed accurately and without unintended consequences. This allows me to be more authentic and honest in my communication, without the pressure of an immediate response.Lastly, email enables fluency in communicating, especially for non-native speakers. As someone who is not a native English speaker, I find that email allows me to take my time to look up words, phrases, and expressions that I'm not familiar with, ensuring that my message is conveyed correctly and without misunderstandings. This has helped me to communicate more effectively and confidently, which is essential in both personal and professional settings.In conclusion, while different people may prefer different modes of communication, I believe that email is an effective and convenient way to connect with others. Its advantages of convenience, honest expression, and fluency make it an ideal choice for me, and I believe that it can be beneficial for others as well.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";The advent of television has revolutionized the way we spend our leisure time, but it has also been accused of destroying communication among friends and family. I agree with this statement, as television has had a profoundly negative impact on interpersonal relationships. In my opinion, television has more bad effects than good, primarily because it has made people less inclined to engage in conversation with each other.Television shows, in particular, have a way of captivating our attention and making us forget what is truly important. When we watch TV, we often become so engrossed in the programs that we neglect our relationships with others. For instance, when a favorite show is on air, people often become obsessed with it, shutting out their family and friends. I have seen this happen in my own family, where my parents would often argue over what channel to watch, completely ignoring each other's opinions and needs.Furthermore, television has become a substitute for human interaction, leading to a decline in face-to-face communication skills. People are more likely to spend hours watching TV than engaging in meaningful conversations with each other. This has resulted in a lack of empathy, understanding, and deep connections among friends and family members. In extreme cases, it has even led to social isolation, where people prefer the company of their TV sets to that of real people.In conclusion, while television has its benefits, such as providing entertainment and education, its negative effects on communication among friends and family cannot be ignored. It is essential to recognize the impact of TV on our relationships and make a conscious effort to strike a balance between TV time and quality time with loved ones.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;The preference for communication methods varies among individuals, with some people favoring traditional face-to-face or telephone interactions, while others prefer the convenience of email or voicemail. While many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, I personally believe that communicating by emails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea, which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, it is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case, it is not so difficult to write a voice mail or send an email. This method of communication alleviates the nervousness and anxiety associated with cold-calling someone you don't know. Additionally, emails and voice mails provide a paper trail, which can be useful for reference or record-keeping purposes.Secondly, you can write an email at any time of the day. As for me, I am a night owl and tend to be more productive later in the day. With emails and voice mails, I can communicate at my own pace, without being restricted by traditional office hours. This flexibility is particularly useful in today's fast-paced world, where people's schedules can be unpredictable.Moreover, emails and voice mails allow for more time to think and reflect on the message being conveyed. This reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can occur in face-to-face or telephone conversations. It also enables the sender to articulate their thoughts more clearly and concisely, resulting in more effective communication.In conclusion, while many people may prefer traditional methods of communication, I firmly believe that communicating by emails or voice mails is better. The ease of use, flexibility, and clarity of thought that these methods provide make them an attractive option in today's digital age.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;"The age-old adage ""haste makes waste"" is a timeless wisdom that cautions against the perils of hasty decision-making. I firmly agree with this statement, as every fast and not well-thought-out decision is indeed a wasted one. In today's fast-paced world, where instant gratification is the norm, it's easy to fall into the trap of making quick decisions without considering the consequences.Making quick decisions leads to probable bad results, as they are often based on incomplete information, emotions, or impulse. For instance, a person who buys a car on impulse without researching its reliability, fuel efficiency, or maintenance costs may end up with a lemon that guzzles gas and breaks down frequently. Similarly, a student who rushes into a career choice without considering their interests, skills, or job market demand may end up in a dead-end job that leads to frustration and stagnation.Hurried decisions not only go to waste but also could affect the entire life of the person. A hasty marriage, for example, may lead to divorce, financial ruin, and emotional distress. A rushed investment decision may result in financial losses that take years to recover from. In extreme cases, a speedy decision to undergo a medical procedure without fully understanding the risks and alternatives may lead to permanent health damage or even death.In conclusion, the saying ""haste makes waste"" is a wise warning that encourages us to slow down, reflect, and deliberate before making decisions. By taking the time to gather information, weigh options, and consider the consequences, we can avoid the pitfalls of hasty decision-making and make choices that lead to positive outcomes. As the old adage goes, ""patience is a virtue"" - and in this case, it's a virtue that can save us from the waste and regret that comes with hasty decisions."
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;The automobile has been a staple of modern life for decades, and opinions about its impact vary widely. While some people believe that cars have improved modern life, others argue that they have caused serious problems. In my opinion, the automobile has had a largely positive impact on modern life, and I will provide specific reasons and examples to support this view.One of the most significant advantages of the automobile is its ability to facilitate travel and exploration. With a car, people can travel long distances easily and efficiently, allowing them to experience new places and cultures. This has opened up the world to people who may not have been able to travel otherwise, and has enabled us to connect with others across the globe. For example, many people use their cars to take road trips to national parks, beaches, or cities, which has helped to promote tourism and cultural exchange.Another benefit of the automobile is its impact on daily life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are to our modern way of life. Cars provide us with independence and freedom, allowing us to travel where we want, when we want. This has enabled us to live in suburban areas and commute to work, school, or other activities, which has helped to shape the modern suburban lifestyle.Overall, I believe that the automobile has improved modern life. It has enabled us to travel more often, experience new places and cultures, and live more independently. While there are certainly problems associated with car ownership, such as traffic congestion and air pollution, I believe that the benefits of the automobile far outweigh the drawbacks.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;The idea that children should choose jobs similar to their parents' has been a topic of discussion for many years. While some people believe that following in their parents' footsteps can be beneficial, others argue that it can limit a child's potential and creativity. In this essay, I will argue that it is better for children to choose jobs similar to their parents' jobs, as it can provide them with valuable support and guidance in their career.Choosing a job that is similar to one's parents' can be advantageous in many ways. For instance, parents who are already established in a particular field can offer their children valuable domain knowledge and industry-related information. This can help their children to gain a deeper understanding of the industry and make more informed decisions about their career path. Moreover, parents who are familiar with the work environment can provide their children with valuable connections and networks, which can be essential in securing job opportunities and advancing in their careers.Some may argue that the job market is constantly changing, and the conditions that parents faced in their careers may be different from those that their children will face. However, I believe that parents can still play an important role in guiding their children's career choices. While the job market may change, the principles of hard work, dedication, and perseverance remain the same. Parents can impart these values to their children and help them to develop the skills and mindset necessary to succeed in their chosen careers.Furthermore, parents can also provide emotional support and guidance to their children as they navigate their careers. They can offer advice on how to handle challenges and setbacks, and provide encouragement and motivation when needed. This can be especially important during the early stages of a child's career, when they may be facing uncertainty and self-doubt.In conclusion, while some may argue that choosing a job similar to one's parents' can be limiting, I believe that it can provide many benefits. Parents can offer valuable support, guidance, and industry knowledge that can help their children to succeed in their careers. By following in their parents' footsteps, children can gain a smoother transition into their careers and set themselves up for long-term success.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;The salaries of professional athletes and entertainers have long been a topic of debate. These individuals earn astronomical sums of money that are hard to fathom for the average person. Some argue that the vast disparity between their earnings and those of ordinary citizens is unfair. However, from my perspective, I firmly believe that professional athletes and entertainers deserve their high salaries.First and foremost, a worker's salary should be a reflection of their competence. Professional athletes and entertainers possess exceptional talents that are honed through years of dedication, hard work, and perseverance. Their skills are not easily replicable, and their performances are a result of intense training, discipline, and natural ability. It is only fair that their salaries mirror their extraordinary capabilities. The market dictates their worth, and if their services are in high demand, it is reasonable that they receive compensation that reflects their value.Secondly, high salaries are a necessary incentive for professional athletes and entertainers to maintain their exceptional standards. The pressure to perform at the highest level is immense, and the slightest drop in form can result in a significant loss of income. High salaries provide a safety net, allowing them to focus on their craft without worrying about financial stability. This, in turn, guarantees their great performances, which are a result of their unwavering dedication and passion for their sport or art.In conclusion, while the disparity in earnings between professional athletes and entertainers and the general public may seem unfair at first glance, it is essential to acknowledge that their salaries are a reflection of their extraordinary talents and the value they bring to their respective industries. High salaries are not only a well-deserved recognition of their hard work and dedication but also a necessary motivator to ensure their continued excellence.
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;Title: The Importance of Music and Art in Early Childhood EducationAs parents, we often prioritize our children's academic development, focusing on core subjects like math, science, history, and language. However, I firmly believe that music and art should also be an integral part of a young child's education, particularly between the ages of 5-10. In fact, many parents already recognize the value of music and art, including them in their child's must-learn list.In my opinion, it is essential to introduce music and art to children at a young age, as these subjects play a vital role in developing their senses and creativity. Research has shown that exposure to music and art can enhance a child's cognitive skills, improve their memory, and boost their self-esteem. Moreover, music and art education can foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, all of which are essential for a child's overall development.Music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing, as they can bring numerous benefits throughout a person's life. They can provide a means of self-expression, stress relief, and a sense of accomplishment. Moreover, music and art can nourish one's temperament, helping to develop empathy, patience, and discipline. By introducing these subjects at a young age, we can lay the foundation for a lifelong appreciation and understanding of the arts.Incorporating music and art into a child's curriculum can also have a positive impact on their academic performance. Studies have shown that students who receive music and art education tend to perform better in their core subjects, as they develop a more well-rounded and creative approach to learning.In conclusion, music and art are essential components of a well-rounded education, particularly for young children. By prioritizing these subjects, we can help our children develop their senses, creativity, and critical thinking skills, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and successful life.
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;The age-old question of how to pique students' interest in a subject has been a longstanding concern for teachers. In my opinion, the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school. This approach not only makes the learning experience more relevant but also instills a sense of purpose in the students.By explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have a vivid impression of its significance, thus becoming more active in acquiring the knowledge. When students can see the practical application of a subject, they are more likely to engage with it on a deeper level. For instance, a student who understands how mathematics is used in finance or economics is more likely to take an interest in the subject, as they can see how it will benefit them in their future careers.Moreover, this approach helps to break down the barriers between the classroom and the real world. Students often perceive school subjects as abstract and disconnected from their everyday lives. By bridging this gap, teachers can make the subject more tangible and accessible, leading to increased motivation and enthusiasm. Furthermore, when students can relate to a subject on a personal level, they are more likely to develop a genuine interest in it, rather than just seeing it as a means to pass an exam.In conclusion, explaining how a subject can be applied to daily life is, in my opinion, the most effective way for teachers to spark students' interest in a subject. By making the learning experience more relevant and purposeful, teachers can inspire students to take a more active role in their education, leading to a more engaging and rewarding learning experience.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;As the world grapples with the complexities of the 21st century, two pressing issues have emerged as the epicenter of global concern: environmental protection and economic development. Both are vital to human welfare and the future of our planet, yet they often find themselves at odds with one another. In my opinion, governments should prioritize environmental protection over economic development in their budget allocations.The reasoning behind this stance is rooted in the understanding that environmental degradation poses an existential threat to human existence. Climate change, deforestation, and pollution are just a few examples of the catastrophic consequences of neglecting our planet's well-being. If left unchecked, these issues will not only compromise our quality of life but also threaten the very foundations of our societies. In contrast, while economic development is crucial for improving living standards and alleviating poverty, it can be achieved in a sustainable manner that does not harm the environment.Furthermore, investing in environmental protection can have numerous economic benefits in the long run. For instance, renewable energy sources can create new job opportunities and stimulate local economies. Additionally, preserving natural resources can maintain ecosystem services that support agriculture, forestry, and tourism industries. Therefore, prioritizing environmental protection is not a zero-sum game where economic development must be sacrificed. Rather, it is a strategic investment in a sustainable future that can yield economic benefits while ensuring the well-being of our planet.In conclusion, as we navigate the intricate balance between environmental protection and economic development, governments must recognize the primacy of safeguarding our planet's resources. By prioritizing environmental protection in their budget allocations, governments can create a foundation for sustainable development that benefits both the environment and the economy, ultimately securing a livable future for generations to come.
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;The notion that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today is a topic of ongoing debate. Some individuals argue that the growing environmental concerns will lead to a decline in car usage, while others believe that personal vehicles remain essential for daily life. In my opinion, I concur with the former statement, and I firmly believe that the number of cars on the road will decrease in the future.On one hand, the escalating concerns about climate change, air pollution, and the overall environmental impact of fossil fuels have led to a significant shift in public opinion. Many people, particularly the younger generation, are becoming increasingly aware of the need to adopt sustainable modes of transportation. As a result, there has been a surge in demand for eco-friendly alternatives, such as electric vehicles, hybrid cars, and public transportation systems. Cities worldwide are also investing heavily in infrastructure to support cycling, walking, and other environmentally friendly modes of transport.On the other hand, some people still believe that owning a personal car is crucial for daily life. They argue that cars provide convenience, flexibility, and independence, especially in areas with limited public transportation options. However, I believe that the benefits of reduced car usage outweigh these perceived advantages. With the rise of car-sharing services, ride-hailing apps, and improving public transportation systems, the need for personal car ownership is slowly diminishing.In conclusion, I firmly agree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today. The growing environmental concerns, advancements in eco-friendly transportation alternatives, and shifting public opinion all point towards a future with reduced car usage. As the world continues to evolve and prioritize sustainability, I believe that we will witness a significant decline in the number of cars on the road.
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;The statement that university students do not need to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations is a contentious issue. On one hand, university students are given the independence to take charge of their learning, which includes deciding whether or not to attend classes. Some students may feel that they can manage their studies and ace their exams without attending classes, and thus, may not see the need to physically be present in the classroom.On the other hand, attending classes is an integral part of the learning process, particularly at the university level. In-class discussions, debates, and interactions with peers and instructors provide a rich and dynamic learning environment that is hard to replicate through solo studying. Not only do students learn from their instructors, but they also benefit from the collective knowledge and experiences of their peers. Moreover, attending classes helps students stay motivated, focused, and accountable, as they are more likely to keep up with the coursework and participate in class activities.Attending classes is not only beneficial for learning, but it is also a basic responsibility of students. By enrolling in a university program, students have committed to participating in the academic process, which includes attending classes. Not attending classes is not only a disservice to oneself, but also to the academic community, as it undermines the collaborative learning environment that universities strive to create.In conclusion, while some students may feel that they can manage their studies without attending classes, the benefits of attending classes far outweigh the perceived advantages of solo studying. Attending classes is essential for effective learning, and it is the responsibility of students to participate in the academic process.
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;"The age-old debate about the role of hard work and luck in achieving success has sparked intense discussion among scholars and the general public alike. The quotation, ""When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success,"" presents a strong stance on the matter. While some people think that luck is the primary cause of a lot of success, to be frank, I cannot agree with them.To begin with, famous people who have achieved greatness in their respective fields are usually diligent individuals who have put in countless hours of effort and perseverance to reach the top. Take, for instance, Thomas Edison, who is famously known for inventing the light bulb. It is said that he experimented with over 1,000 different filaments before finding the right one. This level of dedication and persistence cannot be attributed to luck, but rather to his unwavering commitment to his craft. Similarly, successful entrepreneurs, athletes, and artists have all spoken about the hard work and sacrifices they made to achieve their goals.Besides, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. Relying solely on luck would mean that our success is based on chance, rather than our abilities and efforts. This would undermine the value of hard work and the sense of accomplishment that comes with achieving our goals through our own merit. Furthermore, if luck were the primary cause of success, it would be impossible to replicate or sustain success over time, as luck is unpredictable and fleeting.In conclusion, while luck may play a minor role in achieving success, it is ultimately hard work and dedication that lead to success. I firmly believe that the quotation is correct in asserting that hard work, not luck, is the key to achieving success."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;The debate about whether one can learn better with a teacher or by themselves has been ongoing for quite some time. While some individuals believe that self-study is the most effective way to learn, others argue that having a teacher is essential for optimal learning. In my opinion, I prefer learning with a teacher, but I also acknowledge the benefits of self-study.On one hand, learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. A good teacher can provide clear explanations, offer guidance, and answer questions that may arise during the learning process. This personalized attention can help clarify any misconceptions and ensure that the student is on the right track. Moreover, a teacher can tailor their instruction to meet the individual needs of their students, which can lead to faster and more effective learning.On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learn on my own. Self-study allows me to learn at my own pace, review material as many times as I need, and focus on areas where I require more attention. Additionally, learning independently can foster self-motivation, discipline, and time management skills, which are essential for success in any field. With the abundance of online resources and study materials available, it is now easier than ever to learn without a teacher.However, I still believe that a good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. A teacher can provide expert insights, share their own experiences, and offer valuable feedback that can help me improve my understanding of the subject matter. They can also identify knowledge gaps and adjust their instruction accordingly, ensuring that I receive a comprehensive education.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the benefits of self-study, I believe that learning with a teacher is the most effective way to learn. A good teacher can provide personalized guidance, prevent confusion, and increase the rate of learning. However, it is also important to recognize the value of self-study and incorporate it into one's learning routine to develop essential skills such as self-motivation and time management.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;The rapid advancement of technology has transformed the way we work, with many individuals having the option to work from home using a computer and a phone. While some may argue that working from home is more convenient and efficient, I strongly disagree with the statement. In my opinion, working at a company's office is more beneficial than working from home.One of the primary reasons I disagree with the statement is that working from home can lead to missed opportunities and important events. When employees work from home, they are more likely to miss out on crucial announcements from their boss or colleagues, such as project updates, team meetings, or company-wide news. These events are essential for staying informed and aligned with the company's goals and objectives. By working from home, individuals may feel disconnected from the team and miss out on valuable information that can impact their work.Moreover, working from home can be less efficient due to the lack of structure and accountability. Without a traditional office environment, it can be easy to fall into bad habits, such as procrastination or distraction. In an office setting, employees are more likely to stay focused and motivated, as they are surrounded by colleagues who are also working towards a common goal.On the other hand, some may argue that with the right equipment, people can work from anywhere and be just as productive. However, while this may be true for some individuals, it is not the case for everyone. Human interaction and face-to-face communication are essential for building relationships, resolving conflicts, and fostering creativity. Working from home can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from the team, ultimately hindering productivity and job satisfaction.In conclusion, while technology has made it possible to work from anywhere, I firmly believe that working at a company's office is more beneficial than working from home. By working in an office, individuals can stay informed, connected, and motivated, ultimately leading to greater productivity and job satisfaction.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;The idea that in order to succeed, one should conform to societal norms and be like everyone else is a notion that has been debated for centuries. However, I strongly disagree with this statement. Being different from everyone else is often a hallmark of innovation, creativity, and success. When an individual dares to be different, it usually means that they have achieved something superior to others. This uniqueness is what sets them apart and earns them recognition.Moreover, being unique allows individuals to create their own value, which cannot be replicated or taken away by others. This is particularly evident in the business world, where companies that dare to be different often achieve unparalleled success. Take, for example, Apple, one of the most popular and prestigious technology companies in the world. Apple's success can be attributed to its willingness to challenge conventional norms and create products that are truly innovative and unique. The company's co-founder, Steve Jobs, was notorious for his unconventional approach to design and technology, which resulted in the creation of game-changing products like the iPod, iPhone, and iPad.By embracing their uniqueness, Apple was able to create a brand that is synonymous with innovation and style. The company's success is a testament to the fact that being different is not a liability, but rather a strength. In a world where conformity is often encouraged, it is the individuals and companies that dare to be different that truly make a lasting impact. Therefore, I firmly believe that being different from everyone else is not a hindrance to success, but rather a key to achieving greatness.
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;I disagree with the statement that the personal and work-related challenges faced by young people today are not different from those faced by their parents and grandparents when they were young. In fact, I firmly believe that the challenges faced by this generation are significantly different from those of the last generation.Firstly, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges are getting more complicated and challenging. Unlike their parents and grandparents, who had relatively stable and secure job prospects, young people today are facing a highly competitive and rapidly changing job market. With the rise of automation, artificial intelligence, and the gig economy, the notion of job security has become increasingly uncertain. Moreover, the skills required to succeed in the modern workplace are constantly evolving, making it difficult for young people to keep up with the demands of the industry. In contrast, previous generations faced relatively straightforward and predictable career paths.Secondly, this generation is encountering a unique set of personal challenges, particularly with regards to self-recognition. Unlike previous generations, young people today are constantly bombarded with curated and idealized images of others on social media, leading to unrealistic expectations and a distorted view of reality. This has resulted in increased anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem among young people. Additionally, the pressure to present a perfect online persona has created a sense of disconnection between their online and offline identities, leading to a crisis of self-recognition. This issue was not as prevalent in the past, where social media was not a dominant force in everyday life.In conclusion, the challenges faced by young people today are distinct from those faced by their parents and grandparents. The rapidly changing work landscape and the pressures of social media have created a unique set of difficulties that require new and innovative solutions.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;There are numerous viewpoints regarding the primary characteristics of successful individuals. Some may argue that being cautious and sticking to what they know is key to achieving success, while others believe that taking risks and trying new things is the path to greatness. In my opinion, the latter statement holds true. Successful people indeed try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.One of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. When individuals step out of their comfort zones and experiment with novel experiences, they are exposed to fresh perspectives, skills, and knowledge. This exposure enables them to grow both personally and professionally, broadening their understanding of the world and equipping them with the tools necessary to tackle complex challenges. For instance, Thomas Edison's persistence in experimenting with different filaments led to the invention of the light bulb, a revolutionary innovation that transformed the world. His willingness to try new things and take risks ultimately paved the way for his groundbreaking achievement.I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. Playing it safe and adhering to familiar routines may yield some success, but it is unlikely to lead to remarkable achievements. Successful people are often those who dare to challenge the status quo, push boundaries, and explore uncharted territories. Take, for example, Steve Jobs' bold decision to merge technology and art at Apple, which led to the creation of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, products that redefined the tech industry. His courage to take risks and try new things propelled him to unprecedented heights of success. In conclusion, embracing new experiences and taking calculated risks is a hallmark of successful individuals. It is through this willingness to venture into the unknown that they can uncover new opportunities, learn valuable lessons, and achieve greatness.
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;The statement that the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school for success in a future job is a complex one, and opinions on it vary greatly. In my view, I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job. Effective communication is also one of the other key factors for success in any career, and relating well with people plays a significant role in achieving this.By relating well with people, we are likely to have a wide network of communication, which can lead to opportunities, partnerships, and collaborations that are essential for professional growth. For instance, a salesperson who can build rapport with their clients is more likely to close deals and achieve their targets than one who is unable to connect with them. Similarly, a manager who can effectively communicate with their team members can motivate and lead them to achieve their goals.On the other hand, studying hard in school is crucial for acquiring the knowledge and skills required for a particular job. It provides a foundation for understanding the technical aspects of a profession and staying updated with the latest developments in the field. Without a strong educational background, it can be challenging to perform well in a job, regardless of how well one can relate to people.In conclusion, while relating well to people is a vital skill for success in a future job, it is not more important than studying hard in school. Both are equally important, and effective communication is the key that ties them together. By balancing academic achievement with interpersonal skills, individuals can set themselves up for success in their chosen careers.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;The role of advertising in shaping our eating habits has been a topic of discussion in recent years. Some argue that advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits, while others disagree. In this essay, we will examine this statement and provide arguments for and against it.On the one hand, advertising has become an integral part of modern society, influencing people's choices in various aspects of life, including food. Advertisements for unhealthy foods, such as junk food and sugary drinks, are ubiquitous and often targeted at children and young adults. These advertisements can create cravings and temptation, leading people to make unhealthy food choices.On the other hand, I disagree that advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits. In my opinion, the key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in the concept of wholesome diets and self-control. People need to be aware of the importance of a balanced diet and make informed choices about the food they eat. While advertising can influence people's choices, it is ultimately up to individuals to make healthy decisions.Furthermore, advertising can also lead to healthier eating habits. With the growing awareness of the importance of living a healthy lifestyle, many companies are now advertising healthy food options and promoting balanced diets. This can encourage people to make healthier choices and develop better eating habits.In conclusion, while advertising can play a role in shaping our eating habits, it is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in the concept of wholesome diets and self-control.
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";"The statement ""television has destroyed communication among friends and family"" is a debatable topic. While I understand where this perspective is coming from, I disagree with it. Television, in itself, is a great tool to learn, entertain, and inform people about what's happening around the world. It offers a wide range of programs that cater to different interests, age groups, and educational needs.However, it is undeniable that television has some negative effects among some people. Excessive television watching can lead to social isolation, which in turn can affect communication among friends and family. Some people spend a lot of time watching television, often at the expense of other activities that promote social interaction. Moreover, some people even eat while watching television, which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and a decline in face-to-face communication.Despite these negative effects, it is unfair to say that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Television can also bring people together, as seen in families gathering to watch favorite TV shows or sports events. It can also provide topics for conversation and stimulate discussions. Additionally, television can be a valuable educational tool, providing access to information and knowledge that can be shared among friends and family.In conclusion, while excessive television watching can have negative effects on communication, it is not accurate to say that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. A balanced approach to television watching, combined with other activities that promote social interaction, can help mitigate its negative effects and maximize its benefits."
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;The importance of sports and social activities in universities and colleges is a topic of ongoing debate. While some argue that these activities are just as important as classes and libraries, I disagree with the statement that they should receive equal financial support. University students can be broadly divided into two groups: those who are less interested in studying and those who are diligent and hardworking. For the former, sports and social activities can be a distraction, drawing them away from their academic pursuits. On the other hand, for students who are serious about their studies, these activities can be a welcome break, providing an opportunity to recharge and refocus. It is well established that regular exercise is essential for a healthy and happy life. Engaging in physical activity for at least 30 minutes daily has numerous physical and mental health benefits. However, I believe that the primary purpose of a university or college education is academic, and therefore, financial support should be prioritized accordingly. Academic facilities such as libraries and laboratories are fundamental to a student's learning experience. These facilities provide access to resources and equipment that are essential for academic success. In contrast, while sports and social activities are beneficial, they are not as crucial to a student's academic achievement. In conclusion, while sports and social activities have a role to play in university life, I do not think that they should receive equal financial support as academic facilities. The primary focus of a university education is academic, and financial support should be prioritized accordingly.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;The debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes or not has been ongoing for a while. Some people believe that attending classes is a must, while others think that it should be optional. In my opinion, I agree that university students should be required to attend classes, and I will explain my reasons in detail.Attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provides them with a variety of learning opportunities. For instance, being present in class allows students to interact with their peers, which is beneficial for understanding new material. Students can review and discuss topics during their free time in college, which helps to clarify any doubts they may have. Additionally, being in class gives students the opportunity to ask questions and seek help from their instructors, which is essential for comprehending difficult concepts.Moreover, attending classes is crucial for students who need assistance with complex problems. By being present in class, students can seek help from their instructors or classmates, which can make a significant difference in their understanding of the material. On the other hand, if students are not required to attend classes, they may miss out on these opportunities and struggle to keep up with the coursework.Furthermore, attending classes helps students to develop important skills such as time management, teamwork, and communication. By attending classes, students learn to prioritize their tasks, work in groups, and express their ideas effectively. These skills are essential for their future careers and personal growth.In conclusion, while some people may think that attending classes should be optional, I firmly believe that it should be mandatory. The benefits of attending classes, including the opportunity to interact with peers, seek help from instructors, and develop important skills, make it an essential part of the university experience.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;While some may argue that telephones and email have made communication between people less personal, I strongly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, the advent of telephones and email has not only made communication more convenient but also more effective. The ability to communicate with anyone, anywhere in the world, at any time, has revolutionized the way we interact with each other.First and foremost, telephones and email have enabled me to communicate directly with the people I want to connect with, regardless of their geographical location. With just a few clicks or a phone call, I can reach out to friends, family, or colleagues who live on the other side of the world. This has made my life easier, as I can now stay in touch with loved ones who are physically far away.Secondly, I find that telephones and email allow me to express important thoughts and feelings more effectively than face-to-face communication. When communicating in person, there can be distractions, interruptions, or even misinterpretations of nonverbal cues. In contrast, writing an email or sending a text message gives me the opportunity to carefully craft my message, ensuring that I convey my intended meaning without any misunderstandings.For instance, when I need to apologize or express gratitude, I find that writing an email or sending a heartfelt message allows me to articulate my feelings more sincerely and thoughtfully. This, in turn, has helped me to build stronger relationships, as my loved ones appreciate the effort and thoughtfulness I put into my digital communications.In conclusion, I firmly believe that telephones and email have enhanced the way we communicate, making it more personal and effective. These tools have opened up new avenues for connecting with others, and I am grateful for the convenience and flexibility they offer.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;When it comes to choosing the ideal place to live, people often find themselves torn between the tranquility of a small town and the vibrancy of a big city. As for me, I would unequivocally prefer to live in a big city, and for good reason.First and foremost, big cities offer a diverse array of social places that cater to various interests. For instance, one can indulge in a plethora of restaurants, explore museums, unwind at bars, join sporting clubs, catch the latest movies at cinemas, or appreciate a theatrical performance. This variety not only enhances one's social life but also provides numerous opportunities to meet new people and make friends. In stark contrast, small towns have limited options, often with only one bar or cinema, which can lead to a monotonous social life.Another significant advantage of living in a big city is access to advanced medical technologies. Metropolitan areas are typically equipped with state-of-the-art hospitals, specialized clinics, and cutting-edge medical research facilities. This ensures that residents have access to the best possible healthcare, which, in my opinion, outweighs the potential drawbacks of city living, such as noise pollution and crowds. The availability of superior medical care is a significant factor, especially for those who require ongoing medical attention or have specific health concerns.In conclusion, while small towns may offer a peaceful atmosphere, the benefits of living in a big city far outweigh the advantages of rural living. The abundance of social opportunities and access to advanced medical technologies make city living an attractive choice for those who value diversity, convenience, and top-notch healthcare.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;When it comes to personal preferences, people often find themselves at a crossroads - to stick with what they already do well or to venture into uncharted territory. As for me, I firmly believe that trying new things and taking calculated risks is the key to growth and success. While some may argue that focusing on what they are good at is the best way to achieve their goals, I believe that trying new things and taking risks offers a plethora of benefits that cannot be overlooked.Firstly, I love to try new things and take risks even if I am not good at them. This may seem counterintuitive, but I believe that it is through stepping out of my comfort zone that I truly learn and grow. For instance, I once tried my hand at painting, despite having no artistic talent. While my creations were far from masterpieces, the experience taught me the value of experimentation and creativity. Moreover, it allowed me to develop a new appreciation for art and the artists who create it.On the other hand, focusing on what one does well can indeed help them attain their goals. The more time one spends honing their skills, the more likely they are to achieve something great. For example, a musician who dedicates themselves to perfecting their craft is more likely to become a renowned performer. However, I believe that this approach has its limitations. By only doing what they already do well, individuals may miss out on opportunities for growth and development in other areas.In conclusion, while there is merit to focusing on what one does well, I believe that trying new things and taking risks is the key to success. Not only does it allow for personal growth and development, but it also opens up new avenues for achievement and exploration. So, the next time you are tempted to stick with what you know, I urge you to take a chance and try something new - you never know where it may lead you.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;The topic of when children should learn to manage their own money has long been a subject of debate among parents and experts. While many argue that financial responsibility should be taught in adulthood, I firmly believe that children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. This approach has numerous benefits that can shape their financial literacy and set them up for success in the long run.First and foremost, teaching children to manage their own money at a young age helps them develop a sense of financial discipline. By giving them a weekly allowance or earnings from odd jobs, parents can encourage their kids to prioritize spending, saving, and giving. This early exposure to money management helps children understand the value of money and make informed decisions about how to use it. Moreover, it helps them develop good habits, such as saving for short-term and long-term goals, that will serve them well into adulthood.Another reason why children should learn to manage their own money early on is that it prepares them for real-world scenarios. As they grow older, they will inevitably encounter situations where they need to make financial decisions, such as buying groceries, paying bills, or investing in education. By learning how to manage their money at a young age, children can develop the skills and confidence they need to navigate these situations effectively.In conclusion, teaching children to manage their own money at a young age is crucial for their financial development. By giving them hands-on experience with money management, parents can help their kids develop financial discipline, prepare them for real-world scenarios, and set them up for long-term financial success. As a society, we should prioritize financial literacy from a young age, empowering the next generation to make informed financial decisions and achieve their goals.

Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe.

Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture. For instance, I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom, king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture. The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.;The statement that dancing plays an important role in a culture is one that I wholeheartedly agree with. Dancing is a universal language that transcends cultural boundaries, and its significance can be seen in every country around the world. People dance for various reasons, including for fun, to entertain, and to decrease stress. Moreover, dancing is an integral part of a culture's identity, representing the values, beliefs, and traditions of a community.In every country, people dance to express themselves, tell stories, and showcase their heritage. For instance, the traditional Japanese Kabuki dance is a highly stylized form of dance that tells stories of love, honor, and loyalty. Similarly, the Indian classical dance form of Bharatanatyam is a highly revered art form that is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology. These dances not only entertain but also represent the rich cultural heritage of their respective countries.Furthermore, dancing can represent the civilization of a culture. The complexity and sophistication of a dance form can reflect the advancements and achievements of a civilization.

Similarly, the intricate footwork and ornate costumes of the traditional Chinese Lion Dance reflect the country's rich cultural history and imperial legacy.In addition to its cultural significance, dancing is also a popular form of entertainment.

Dancing brings people together, creates a sense of community, and provides a platform for self-expression. In conclusion, dancing plays a vital role in a culture, representing the values, beliefs, and traditions of a community, reflecting the civilization of a culture, and entertaining people around the world.
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;The debate regarding the importance of understanding ideas and concepts versus learning facts has been a longstanding one in the realm of education. While some argue that grasping ideas and concepts is the key to a student's future success, I firmly believe that learning facts has more significant advantages for students' future lives.First and foremost, when students learn a multitude of facts in school, they are better equipped to tackle problems that may arise in their personal lives. By having a vast reservoir of knowledge, students can draw upon this information to make informed decisions and navigate complex situations. For instance, a student who has learned about different historical events, cultural norms, and scientific principles can apply this knowledge to understand and address real-world issues. This ability to recall and utilize facts enables students to think critically and develop problem-solving skills, which are essential for success in their future endeavors.Secondly, learning facts can also have a profound impact on students' social behavior. When students are well-versed in various subjects, they are more likely to engage in meaningful conversations, participate in discussions, and interact with their peers in a more confident and respectful manner. This, in turn, fosters a sense of community and social cohesion, as students can bond over shared interests and knowledge. Furthermore, having a strong foundation in facts can also promote respect for others' opinions and perspectives, as students are better equipped to understand and appreciate different viewpoints.In conclusion, while understanding ideas and concepts is undoubtedly important, I firmly believe that learning facts has more significant advantages for students' future lives. By acquiring a vast array of knowledge, students can develop problem-solving skills, engage in meaningful social interactions, and cultivate a sense of respect for others. As such, I strongly advocate for a curriculum that places a strong emphasis on learning facts, as this will ultimately benefit students in their personal and professional lives.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;The importance of sports and social activities in universities and colleges has been a topic of debate for a long time. Some people believe that these activities are as important as classes and libraries, and should receive equal financial support. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement.Firstly, sports have a vital impact on students' health. Engaging in sports not only helps students maintain a good physical shape, but also boosts their energy levels and overall well-being. Regular exercise has been proven to improve mental health, reduce stress, and increase focus, all of which are essential for academic success. Moreover, sports provide students with valuable skills such as teamwork, discipline, and time management, which are transferable to other areas of life.On the other hand, social activities are equally important for students' personal growth. Participating in social events, clubs, and organizations helps students become familiar with different cultures, perspectives, and ways of thinking. This exposure broadens their understanding of the world and prepares them for an increasingly interconnected society. Furthermore, social activities provide students with opportunities to relax, have fun, and entertain themselves, which is essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.In conclusion, I strongly believe that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries, and should receive equal financial support. Both sports and social activities have a significant impact on students' physical and mental well-being, as well as their personal growth and development. By allocating equal resources to these areas, universities and colleges can provide students with a more comprehensive and well-rounded education, preparing them for success in all areas of life.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;The internet is considered one of the most important inventions of the past century, and its impact on our lives has been immense. While some people believe that the internet provides valuable information, others argue that it creates more problems than benefits. In my opinion, I agree with the latter, but with a twist: I believe that the internet's benefits, such as providing daily necessary information, gaining knowledge, and exploring the world, outweigh the drawbacks.On one hand, the internet has made it possible for people to access vast amounts of information from anywhere in the world. This has enabled us to learn new things, stay updated with current events, and explore different cultures and perspectives. For instance, online educational resources have made it possible for students to access high-quality learning materials, which has improved academic outcomes. Additionally, social media platforms have enabled people to connect with others across the globe, fostering global understanding and collaboration.On the other hand, some people believe that the internet creates several problems, such as misinformation, cyberbullying, and addiction. While these issues are real, I believe that they can be mitigated through responsible internet use and digital literacy. For example, fact-checking websites and critical thinking can help prevent the spread of misinformation. Moreover, parents and educators can play a crucial role in teaching children how to use the internet safely and responsibly.In conclusion, while some people may argue that the internet creates more problems than benefits, I firmly believe that its advantages, such as providing daily necessary information, gaining knowledge, and exploring the world, outweigh the drawbacks. By using the internet responsibly and promoting digital literacy, we can harness its power to improve our lives and create a better world.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;The university is an institution that provides individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in their future careers. When it comes to academic requirements, universities often adopt one of two approaches: either requiring students to take classes in many subjects or specializing in one subject. In my opinion, studying many subjects is superior to specializing in one, as it offers students a more comprehensive education and increased opportunities for their future.One of the primary advantages of studying multiple subjects is that it allows students to explore their interests and passions. By taking classes in various fields, students can discover what truly fascinates them and what they excel in. For instance, a student who is interested in both business and psychology can take classes in both subjects, gaining a deeper understanding of how human behavior impacts marketing strategies. This approach enables students to develop a broader range of skills and knowledge, making them more versatile and attractive to potential employers.Moreover, studying multiple subjects provides students with a more well-rounded education. In today's interconnected world, many fields overlap and intersect. By studying multiple subjects, students can gain a deeper understanding of how different disciplines interact and influence one another. For example, a student who studies both environmental science and economics can develop a more nuanced understanding of how economic policies impact the environment. This interdisciplinary approach prepares students to tackle complex, real-world problems that require a multifaceted perspective.In contrast, specializing in one subject can limit a student's scope of knowledge and skills. While it is true that specializing can provide a deeper understanding of a particular field, it can also lead to a narrow, tunnel-vision approach to problem-solving. By studying multiple subjects, students can develop a more adaptable and innovative mindset, better equipping them to succeed in an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world.In conclusion, while both approaches have their merits, I firmly believe that studying many subjects is better than specializing in one. By exploring multiple fields, students can discover their passions, develop a broader range of skills and knowledge, and gain a more well-rounded education. Ultimately, this approach provides students with the versatility, adaptability, and innovative thinking necessary to succeed in their chosen careers and make a positive impact in their communities.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;In my opinion, government should pay attention to the basic needs of people first before investing heavily in exploring outer space. There are several compelling reasons for this stance, which I will outline below.First and foremost, a significant portion of the global population struggles to meet their basic needs. According to the United Nations, one in every nine people in the world suffers from hunger, and many more lack access to basic necessities like clean water and sanitation. Spending vast amounts of money on space exploration seems frivolous when so many people are struggling to get by.Secondly, job creation is essential for economic growth and stability, yet many countries face high unemployment rates. Governments should focus on creating jobs and stimulating economic growth rather than pouring resources into space exploration. By doing so, they can ensure that citizens have a stable source of income, which is essential for meeting basic needs.Moreover, a good environment is crucial for human well-being, yet many parts of the world suffer from severe pollution and environmental degradation. Governments should prioritize investing in sustainable infrastructure, renewable energy, and conservation efforts rather than spending on space exploration. This would not only improve living conditions but also help mitigate the effects of climate change.Lastly, a loving family is an essential aspect of human life, and governments should support initiatives that promote family well-being. This can include investments in education, healthcare, and social welfare programs that help families thrive. By focusing on these basic needs, governments can create a more stable and supportive environment for their citizens.In conclusion, while exploring outer space is an exciting and ambitious pursuit, I firmly believe that governments should prioritize meeting the basic needs of their citizens first. By doing so, they can create a more stable, supportive, and prosperous society for all.

These make people get stress. Thus, many people try to reduce their stress. There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress. in my opinion, reducing stress by listening to music, playing sports, and doing meditation are easy and practical ways.First of all, listening to music is a great way to relax. For example, when I go to office, I use public transport. I see many things such as traffic jam, crowded people at bus stop, and all so crowded people in buses. These make me stress. So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me. Consequently, I feel happy when I listen music.Second, another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise. For instance, I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time. These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress. Thus, after work, I always do exercise, and jogging is my favorite sport. I feel that after working out, I am easily to fall asleep. Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health.Third, meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress. when I have many things to think about, and this make me stress, I will do meditation. Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment, and it take few minutes. A way to do meditation is that I just sit down, close my eyes, and count my breath. These could relieve me from stress. In conclusion, there are many ways to reduce the stress.

And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind.;"The demands of modern life can be overwhelming, causing stress and anxiety to build up. People have different ways of coping with these pressures, and finding the right stress-reduction technique can make a significant difference in one's overall well-being. In my opinion, some of the most effective ways to reduce stress are through music, exercise, and meditation.Listening to music is a simple yet powerful way to calm the mind and soothe the nerves. Research has shown that listening to music can lower cortisol levels, heart rate, and blood pressure, all indicators of stress. I have personally experienced the benefits of music as a stress-reliever. Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I put on my headphones and listen to my favorite playlist. The melodic tunes and rhythms help to calm my mind, and I feel my tension melting away.Playing sports is another excellent way to reduce stress. Exercise releases endorphins, also known as ""feel-good"" hormones, which help to improve mood and reduce anxiety. Playing sports like basketball, tennis, or swimming can also provide a much-needed distraction from daily worries, allowing individuals to focus on the game and have fun. Moreover, being part of a team or playing with friends can enhance social connections, which is essential for mental health.Meditation is a highly effective technique for stress reduction. By focusing on the breath and quieting the mind, meditation can help to reduce stress hormones and increase feelings of calm and relaxation. Even a short 10-15 minute meditation session can make a significant difference in one's stress levels. Many apps and online resources offer guided meditation sessions, making it easily accessible to anyone.In conclusion, I firmly believe that listening to music, playing sports, and practicing meditation are three of the best ways to reduce stress. These activities are easy to incorporate into daily life, and their benefits are numerous. By making these activities a regular part of our routine, we can better manage the pressures of modern life and improve our overall well-being."
282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;The notion that teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn has been a topic of debate in the educational sector. While some argue that this approach would motivate teachers to be more effective, I strongly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, teachers should not be paid based on their students' learning outcomes.In schools, the main task of a teacher is to impart knowledge to their students within a limited timeframe. Teachers have to cover a vast syllabus and complete the curriculum within a stipulated period. Given the time constraint, it is challenging for teachers to devote individual attention to each student in the class. Every student learns at their own pace, and it is unrealistic to expect teachers to cater to the diverse learning needs of all students.Moreover, the learning abilities of students vary significantly. Some students may grasp complex concepts effortlessly, while others may struggle to understand the same material. This disparity in learning abilities makes it unfair to judge a teacher's performance based on their students' test results. For instance, a teacher may have a student with special needs or one who is an English language learner, and it would be unjust to penalize the teacher for the student's lower test scores.Paying teachers based on their students' learning outcomes would create an unfair and high-pressure work environment. It would lead to teachers focusing on students who are already performing well, rather than supporting those who need extra attention. This approach would undermine the core principle of teaching, which is to provide equal opportunities for all students to learn and grow.In conclusion, while the intention behind paying teachers based on student learning outcomes may be to improve educational standards, it is an inherently flawed approach. Teachers should be paid based on their qualifications, experience, and dedication to their profession, rather than being judged solely on their students' test results.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;The statement that movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished is a topic of ongoing debate. On one hand, it is common for movies and dramas to follow a traditional narrative arc, where good triumphs over evil and justice is served. This can be seen in many classic tales, where the hero emerges victorious and the villain is punished. Such storylines often provide a sense of closure and satisfaction for the audience.However, I disagree with the statement. While it is true that many movies and dramas have a happy ending and punish bad people, I believe that it is not always proper to portray good people as always getting a happy ending. In reality, good people can sometimes experience bad endings, and it is essential to acknowledge this complexity. If we only show children that good people always win and bad people always lose, it can create a misunderstanding of the world. It can lead to unrealistic expectations and a lack of preparation for the challenges and uncertainties of life.By presenting stories that reflect the complexity of real life, we can help children develop a more nuanced understanding of the world. This can include stories where good people face adversity, make mistakes, or experience setbacks. By doing so, we can teach children valuable lessons about resilience, perseverance, and the importance of learning from failure. Ultimately, a more realistic portrayal of good and bad in movies and television programs can help children develop a more mature and informed understanding of the world around them.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;The concept of distance learning and online computer classes has gained immense popularity in recent years, with many institutions and experts advocating for its potential to replace traditional classroom learning. However, while there are indeed many advantages to distance learning, I strongly believe that it should not replace classroom learning entirely. In this essay, I will present reasons to support my opinion that online courses should not replace traditional classroom learning.First and foremost, distance learning lacks the essential human interaction and socialization that is inherent in classroom learning. Face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers is crucial for students' emotional and social development, as well as their ability to engage in discussions, debates, and collaborative learning. Online courses, on the other hand, often rely on pre-recorded videos, chat forums, and virtual meetings, which cannot replicate the richness and depth of human interaction.Another significant drawback of distance learning is the lack of hands-on experience and practical skills training. Many subjects, such as laboratory sciences, arts, and crafts, require students to engage in hands-on activities, experiments, and projects, which cannot be effectively conducted in an online environment. Moreover, online courses often struggle to provide students with the same level of feedback, guidance, and support that they would receive in a traditional classroom setting.Furthermore, while distance learning offers flexibility and convenience, it also requires students to be highly self-motivated and disciplined, which can be a significant challenge for many students. Without the structure and accountability of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track, manage their time effectively, and meet deadlines.In conclusion, while distance learning has its advantages, it should not replace traditional classroom learning. The benefits of face-to-face interaction, hands-on experience, and personalized guidance and feedback in a traditional classroom setting are essential for students' overall development and academic success. Instead, I believe that distance learning should be seen as a supplement to traditional learning, providing students with additional flexibility and convenience, but not replacing the richness and depth of human interaction and experiential learning that classroom learning provides.
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;As I reflect on my life, I am reminded of the numerous experiences that have significantly shaped my outlook and the way I live today. These experiences have not only molded my perspective but have also taught me valuable life skills that I continue to apply in my daily life.One such experience was my time studying in university. It was a transformative period that taught me the importance of being a prudent person. I learned to approach problems in a methodical and analytical manner, breaking them down into manageable parts and devising effective solutions. This experience has had a lasting impact on my life, as I now tackle challenges with a clear and level head. The university environment also taught me the value of self-discipline, time management, and perseverance – essential skills that have benefited me in all aspects of my life.Another set of experiences that have shaped my outlook are those related to self-care. I have learned that taking care of oneself is not a luxury, but a necessity. Through trial and error, I have discovered the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance, prioritizing physical and mental well-being, and nurturing meaningful relationships. These experiences have taught me to be more compassionate and empathetic towards others, as well as towards myself. By prioritizing my own well-being, I have become more resilient and better equipped to handle life's ups and downs.In conclusion, the experiences that have shaped my outlook and the way I live now are numerous and varied. From the academic rigors of university to the importance of self-care, these experiences have taught me valuable lessons that I continue to apply in my daily life. They have helped me develop into a more prudent, compassionate, and resilient person, better equipped to navigate life's challenges and make the most of its opportunities.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, learning a foreign language has become an essential skill for individuals seeking to broaden their cultural understanding, enhance their career prospects, and stay competitive in the global market. Many people have opted to learn a foreign language in their home country, while others have chosen to immerse themselves in the language by studying abroad. In my opinion, the latter option is more effective, and I will provide reasons to support this viewpoint.On one hand, learning a foreign language in one's own country has its advantages. It is often more convenient and cost-effective, allowing individuals to balance their language studies with work or other responsibilities. Additionally, many language schools and online resources offer structured lessons and flexible scheduling, making it easier to fit language learning into a busy lifestyle.On the other hand, learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken offers a more immersive and effective learning experience. When surrounded by the language and culture, learners are constantly exposed to authentic materials, such as signs, menus, and conversations, which helps to reinforce their understanding and usage of the language. Moreover, interacting with native speakers on a daily basis enables learners to pick up nuances of pronunciation, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references that may be difficult to grasp in a classroom setting.Furthermore, studying abroad provides opportunities to engage in cultural activities, attend language exchange events, and participate in homestays, all of which foster a deeper understanding of the language and its context. For instance, a student learning Spanish in Spain can attend a flamenco show, watch a soccer match, or participate in a tapas night, all while using their language skills in a real-life setting.In conclusion, while learning a foreign language in one's own country has its advantages, I firmly believe that studying abroad is a more effective way to learn a language. The immersive experience, cultural engagement, and constant exposure to the language make it an unbeatable way to achieve language proficiency. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the importance of speaking multiple languages will only continue to grow, and those who have taken the opportunity to learn a language abroad will be well-prepared to succeed in this globalized world.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;If I could change one important thing about my hometown, it would undoubtedly be the lack of adequate public transportation. While my hometown boasts an impressive array of public utilities, catering to the basic needs of its residents, the dearth of reliable and efficient transportation options has been a long-standing concern.For most people, public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors that influence their decision to live in a particular place. Fortunately, my hometown scores well in this regard, with access to essential services like water, electricity, and sanitation. However, when it comes to transportation, the community falls short. The existing public transportation system is limited, making it difficult for residents to commute to work, school, or other parts of town without relying on personal vehicles.Having more public transportation in my community would greatly benefit its residents. Firstly, it would provide a more affordable and environmentally friendly alternative to driving, reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. Additionally, an improved transportation system would increase access to employment, education, and healthcare opportunities, thereby enhancing the overall quality of life for residents.Moreover, a robust public transportation network would also boost local businesses and tourism, as visitors and shoppers would be able to easily navigate the town. To achieve this, I envision a comprehensive transportation plan that incorporates buses, trains, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. This would not only improve the daily commutes of residents but also make my hometown a more attractive and sustainable place to live.In conclusion, enhancing public transportation is the key change I would make to my hometown. By doing so, we can create a more connected, convenient, and sustainable community that better serves the needs of its residents, while also promoting economic growth and environmental responsibility.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;The debate about whether schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers has been ongoing. In my opinion, I strongly agree that schools should encourage students to evaluate their teachers. Gathering opinions from multiple sources can significantly enhance people's performance, and student evaluations are a valuable way to improve the quality of the educational system.Firstly, student evaluations provide teachers with constructive feedback that can help them refine their teaching methods. Students are the primary recipients of education, and their opinions can offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of a teacher's approach. By listening to their students' feedback, teachers can identify areas where they need to improve, such as communication, clarity, or engagement. This, in turn, can lead to better academic outcomes and a more positive learning experience for students.Secondly, student evaluations can have a broader impact on the entire education system. By analyzing student feedback, schools can identify systemic issues that need to be addressed, such as inadequate resources, outdated curricula, or insufficient support for students with special needs. This can lead to improvements in the overall quality of education, benefiting not just individual teachers but the entire school community.Furthermore, student evaluations can promote a culture of accountability and transparency in education. By involving students in the evaluation process, schools demonstrate their commitment to continuous improvement and their willingness to listen to their students' voices. This can foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among students, encouraging them to take a more active role in their own learning.In conclusion, asking students to evaluate their teachers is a valuable way to improve the quality of education. Not only can it help individual teachers refine their practice, but it can also lead to broader improvements in the education system as a whole. By harnessing the power of student feedback, schools can create a more effective, responsive, and student-centered learning environment.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;When it comes to choosing between working for a large company or a small one, I personally prefer to work for a large company. This preference stems from several compelling reasons that align with my career aspirations and personal interests.First and foremost, large companies are generally more visible and have more job openings than small companies. This visibility translates into a more accessible job market. For instance, multinational corporations often have well-established human resource systems that make job postings easy to find and apply for. In contrast, small companies may not have the same level of resources or visibility, making job opportunities harder to come by. The ease of finding a job with a large company is a significant advantage, especially for those just starting their careers.Second, large companies typically have more substantial financial resources than small companies. This often means they can offer better salaries and benefits to their employees. Working for a large company would provide me with financial stability and opportunities for professional growth, as these companies often invest in employee development and training programs.Third, and perhaps most excitingly, working for a large company offers the opportunity to work in an international context. Unlike small companies, which usually operate on a local scale, large companies often provide products or services across the nation or even globally. This aspect particularly appeals to me, as I have a strong desire to travel and experience different cultures. Working for a large company could provide me with opportunities to travel, not just within my own country, but internationally as well, which aligns perfectly with my passion for exploration.In conclusion, based on the factors of job accessibility, financial stability, and the opportunity for international travel, I firmly believe that working for a large company is the better choice for me. These advantages not only support my career goals but also cater to my personal interests, making it an ideal fit for my aspirations.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;The debate over whether a college or university education should be available to all students or only to good students has been ongoing. Some people believe that higher education should be exclusive to top-performing students, while others argue that it should be accessible to everyone.On one hand, the argument that higher education should only be available to good students seems to be based on the idea that it is a privilege that should be reserved for those who have demonstrated academic excellence. This view holds that good students are more likely to make the most of the opportunity and go on to achieve great things. However, this perspective neglects the fact that many students who may not have excelled in their early years of education may still have the potential to succeed with the right support and resources.On the other hand, the view that college and university education should be available to all students is more inclusive and recognizes that everyone deserves the opportunity to pursue their goals and aspirations. Colleges and universities play an important role in providing academic skills to people, and this opportunity should not be limited to a select few. By making higher education available to all, we can foster a more educated and skilled society, where everyone has the chance to reach their full potential.In my opinion, I agree that college and university education should be available to all students. Not only does it promote equality and fairness, but it also acknowledges that everyone learns at their own pace and that potential is not solely determined by academic achievement.
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.In today's digital age, a large number of students are obsessed with online computer games. This obsession has led to a decline in their performance at school, as they spend more time exploring virtual worlds than focusing on their studies. The hours spent playing games could be better utilized for academic pursuits, resulting in improved grades and a stronger foundation for future success.Moreover, the content of most computer games offers little to no educational value. Unlike books or documentaries, which can enrich a student's knowledge and broaden their perspectives, computer games primarily serve as a form of entertainment. They do not contribute to the cognitive development or the emotional intelligence of students. As a result, the time spent playing these games can be considered time wasted, as it does not yield any tangible benefits for their academic or personal growth.Furthermore, the majority of these games feature themes that are inappropriate for children, such as war, violence, bloodshed, and sexuality. These elements can desensitize young minds, promoting aggression and disrespect for others. By engaging in these games, students are exposed to harmful influences that can negatively impact their behavior and attitudes towards others.In conclusion, playing computer games is a wasteful activity for students, as it distracts them from their academic duties and exposes them to harmful themes. Rather than encouraging this habit, students should be discouraged from playing computer games and instead, be directed towards more productive and enriching activities. By doing so, we can ensure that our students are well-equipped with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to succeed in life.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;When it comes to working on projects in a team setting, the age-old debate of whether to collaborate in person or via email arises. In my opinion, I firmly believe that working on projects in person is the more effective and efficient approach.Working in person allows team members to communicate face-to-face, which can indirectly improve the quality and efficiency of the project. When individuals are able to discuss and brainstorm ideas in person, they are more likely to build a sense of camaraderie and trust, leading to fewer conflicts and fights amongst team members. This, in turn, leads to a more harmonious and productive working environment. In contrast, email communication can often lead to misinterpretations and misunderstandings, which can hinder the progress of the project.An experiment conducted by Beijing University reinforces this idea. The study found that people are able to reach an agreement quickly when they are able to talk to each other in person. This is likely due to the fact that nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone of voice, are able to convey more nuanced information than written communication. When team members are able to pick up on these cues, they are better able to understand each other's perspectives and come to a consensus.That being said, I do acknowledge that email communication is not without its advantages. In situations where team members are geographically dispersed or have conflicting schedules, email may be the only viable option. In such cases, email is certainly better than no communication at all. However, when possible, I believe that working in person is the superior choice.In conclusion, while email communication has its uses, I firmly believe that working on projects in person is the more effective and efficient approach. By allowing team members to communicate face-to-face, we can build trust, reduce conflicts, and ultimately produce a higher quality project.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;The role of university professors has long been debated, with some arguing that they should prioritize research, while others believe that their primary focus should be on educating students. In recent years, more and more university professors have become involved in scientific research, which has led to concerns that this may compromise the quality of education. However, based on my own experiences, I firmly believe that professors should be encouraged to focus primarily on research.First and foremost, research is a crucial aspect of a professor's job. By conducting research, professors are able to stay updated on the latest developments in their field, which enables them to provide students with the most current and relevant information. Furthermore, research helps to advance knowledge and understanding in various fields, which is essential for innovation and progress. By prioritizing research, professors are able to contribute to the development of new ideas and technologies, which can have a significant impact on society.In addition, research experience is invaluable for students. When professors are actively involved in research, they are able to provide students with hands-on experience and training in research methods and techniques. This not only enhances the learning experience but also prepares students for their own research endeavors. Moreover, research-oriented professors are often more enthusiastic and motivated, which can lead to a more engaging and stimulating learning environment.Some may argue that prioritizing research will lead to a decline in education quality. However, I have found that the opposite is true. Professors who are passionate about research are often more effective teachers, as they are able to convey their excitement and enthusiasm to their students. Moreover, research-oriented professors are often more likely to develop innovative and engaging teaching methods, which can lead to improved student outcomes.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the potential impact of prioritizing research on education quality, I firmly believe that professors should be encouraged to focus primarily on research. By doing so, professors are able to contribute to the advancement of knowledge, provide students with valuable research experience, and create a more engaging and stimulating learning environment.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;When it comes to learning, there are two distinct approaches: self-directed learning and teacher-led instruction. While some individuals thrive in independent study, I firmly believe that learning with a teacher is the more effective approach. In my opinion, having a teacher provides numerous benefits that solo learning simply cannot replicate.For one, learning with a teacher allows for immediate clarification and feedback. When faced with difficulties or questions, a teacher can provide personalized guidance and support, ensuring that misconceptions are addressed promptly. This real-time interaction facilitates a deeper understanding of the material, as learners can receive instant clarification and adjust their learning trajectory accordingly. In contrast, self-directed learners often rely on pre-recorded materials or online resources, which may not provide the same level of interactivity and responsiveness.Moreover, I think that relying solely on oneself in learning can hinder the development of essential soft skills, such as cooperation and effective communication. In a classroom setting, learners are encouraged to engage in discussions, debates, and group projects, which foster valuable skills like teamwork, problem-solving, and articulating one's thoughts. Without a teacher to facilitate these interactions, learners may miss out on opportunities to practice these critical skills, ultimately limiting their personal and professional growth.Furthermore, a teacher can offer diverse perspectives, experiences, and expertise, enriching the learning experience and broadening a learner's understanding of the subject matter. Teachers can also help learners stay motivated and focused, providing encouragement and support when needed.In conclusion, while self-directed learning has its advantages, I firmly believe that learning with a teacher provides a more comprehensive and effective learning experience. The benefits of immediate feedback, interactive learning, and opportunities for skill development make teacher-led instruction the superior choice for those seeking to maximize their learning potential.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;The advent of technology has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with one another. Many people believe that they are blessed to be living in this era of high technology, where information is readily available at their fingertips and tasks can be completed with unprecedented ease and speed. However, a closer examination of the impact of technology on our lives reveals a more nuanced reality. While technology was designed to make our lives simpler, it has, in many ways, made them more complicated.One reason for this complication is the sheer volume of information that technology has made available to us. With the internet at our fingertips, we are constantly bombarded with a deluge of data, much of which is irrelevant, misleading, or downright false. This has led to a state of perpetual distraction, where we are constantly switching between different sources of information, never fully engaging with any one of them. As a result, our attention spans have decreased, and our ability to focus on a single task has become increasingly impaired.Another example of how technology has complicated our lives is the rise of social media. While social media platforms were designed to facilitate communication and connection, they have ultimately led to a culture of curated perfectionism, where people present a highlight reel of their lives, hiding their true selves and experiences. This has led to unrealistic expectations and a sense of inadequacy, as people compare their lives to the seemingly perfect lives of others. Furthermore, social media has also enabled the spread of misinformation and hate speech, which has contributed to a breakdown in civil discourse and a polarization of society.In conclusion, while technology was designed to make our lives simpler, it has ultimately made them more complicated. The volume of information available to us has led to distraction and decreased attention span, while social media has created a culture of perfectionism and facilitated the spread of misinformation. As we move forward in this era of high technology, it is essential that we acknowledge these complications and strive to use technology in a way that truly simplifies our lives, rather than adding to their complexity.
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";The advent of distance-learning programs has undoubtedly transformed the educational landscape, offering students unparalleled flexibility and accessibility. However, the notion that these programs are inferior to traditional, in-person college or university attendance has sparked a lingering debate. While distance-learning has its merits, I firmly believe that classroom learning remains the most effective way to provide education.Classroom learning provides an immersive environment where students are compelled to complete study work on time, fostering a sense of discipline and responsibility. This, in turn, enhances their time management skills, an essential trait for success in both academic and professional spheres. In contrast, online classes often lack the structure and accountability that a physical classroom provides, leading to procrastination and poor time management.Moreover, professors play a vital role in classroom learning, offering valuable information, guidance, and support that is often missing in online courses. Face-to-face interactions with instructors enable students to clarify doubts, engage in discussions, and receive feedback, all of which are crucial for intellectual growth and development. Online courses, while providing pre-recorded lectures and virtual support, cannot replicate the dynamism and immediacy of human interaction.In conclusion, while distance-learning programs have their advantages, I strongly believe that classroom learning remains the superior choice. The benefits of a structured learning environment, time management skills, and personalized professorial guidance make it an unparalleled educational experience. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential to strike a balance between the flexibility of online learning and the richness of traditional classroom education. Ultimately, a well-rounded education requires a combination of both, but if I had to choose, I would unequivocally opt for the time-tested tradition of classroom learning.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";The concept of teenagers holding jobs while still in school is a contentious issue in many countries. While some people do not support this idea, believing it to be detrimental to their academic performance, I firmly believe that it is beneficial for teenagers to engage in part-time work alongside their studies.In my view, having a part-time job can be incredibly valuable for a teenager's personal and professional development. One of the most significant advantages is the opportunity to learn essential life skills, such as time management and money management. By balancing work and school responsibilities, teenagers can develop their ability to prioritize tasks, set schedules, and meet deadlines. Moreover, part-time jobs provide a platform for students to hone their communication skills, learning to effectively convince people through their words, whether it be with customers, colleagues, or managers.Furthermore, part-time jobs offer teenagers the chance to earn a steady income, which can significantly alleviate their parents' financial burdens. Many students use their earnings to support their families, cover educational expenses, or save for their future goals. This sense of financial responsibility can foster a sense of independence and motivation, as teenagers feel more invested in their studies and career aspirations.Additionally, part-time jobs can provide teenagers with a chance to explore different career paths, network with people from various backgrounds, and build valuable work experience. Many students use their part-time jobs as a stepping stone to full-time employment or as a means to gain skills relevant to their desired profession.In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is beneficial for teenagers to have part-time jobs while still in school. By engaging in part-time work, students can develop essential life skills, earn a steady income, and gain valuable work experience.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;Title: The Optimal Way to Learn a Foreign Language: At Home or Abroad?In today's interconnected world, it has become essential for an individual to learn at least one foreign language. As people increasingly interact with foreigners in their personal and professional lives, speaking a foreign language has become a valuable skill. The debate surrounding the optimal way to learn a foreign language has sparked intense discussion, with some advocating for learning in the country where the language is spoken, while others believe it is better to learn in one's own country. In this essay, I will argue that learning a foreign language in one's own country is the better option.One of the primary advantages of learning a foreign language in one's own country is the flexibility and convenience it offers. Students can attend language classes at a local institution, allowing them to balance their language learning with other commitments, such as work or family responsibilities. In contrast, moving to a foreign country to learn a language can be a significant upheaval, requiring major adjustments to one's lifestyle and often involving significant financial costs.Moreover, learning a foreign language in one's own country provides access to qualified teachers and structured learning programs. These programs often include a range of learning materials, such as textbooks, language learning software, and online resources, which can enhance the learning experience. Furthermore, learning a foreign language at home allows students to learn at their own pace, without the pressure of navigating a foreign environment.In conclusion, while there are advantages to learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken, such as immersion and authentic language practice, I firmly believe that learning a foreign language in one's own country is the better option. The flexibility, convenience, and access to quality learning resources make it an ideal choice for those seeking to acquire a new language skill.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;The debate surrounding the ideal vacation structure for students has been ongoing, with some advocating for one long vacation per year, while others propose several short breaks throughout the year. While many people promote the one long vacation system of the school because it would help students to start their course or academic year with a strong zeal of learning, I discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep the stress level of students low. Long periods of academic work without adequate breaks can lead to burnout, causing students to feel overwhelmed and anxious. By incorporating several short vacations, students can recharge and return to their studies with renewed energy and focus. For instance, a study conducted by the American Psychological Association found that students who took regular breaks exhibited lower levels of stress and anxiety compared to those who did not.Moreover, short vacations can also improve students' productivity and concentration. With frequent breaks, students can tackle their academic work with a clear mind, leading to better comprehension and retention of course material. Additionally, several short vacations provide students with the opportunity to pursue extracurricular activities and hobbies, which can help them develop important life skills, such as time management and teamwork.In contrast, one long vacation per year may lead to a long period of inactivity, causing students to lose momentum and struggle to get back into the academic rhythm. Furthermore, a single long break may not be sufficient to alleviate the stress and pressure that builds up over the course of the year.In conclusion, while the one long vacation system has its advantages, I firmly believe that several short vacations throughout the year are more beneficial for students. By incorporating regular breaks, students can maintain a healthy stress level, improve their productivity, and pursue activities that foster personal growth.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";"I firmly agree with the statement ""Never, never give up"" which emphasizes the importance of persistence and perseverance in achieving one's goals. This expression is not just a cliché, but a guiding principle that has been proven to be effective time and time again. In my own life, I have experienced the power of never giving up, and I strongly believe that it is a crucial mindset for success.Personally, I have had my fair share of struggles and setbacks in pursuit of my goals. However, I never lost sight of what I wanted to achieve, and I continued to work towards my objectives with unwavering dedication. One of the most significant accomplishments in my life was winning a medal, which I achieved at the age of nearly thirty. This experience taught me that success is often the result of persistence and hard work, rather than natural talent or luck. Despite facing numerous challenges and disappointments along the way, I refused to give up, and my perseverance ultimately paid off.This experience has had a profound impact on my outlook on life, and I now believe that a person should always keep trying to achieve their goals, no matter how difficult or impossible they may seem. By adopting this mindset, individuals can overcome obstacles, learn from their mistakes, and grow as a person. Moreover, the sense of accomplishment and fulfillment that comes from achieving one's goals is unparalleled, and it is an experience that I believe everyone should strive for.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly agree with the statement ""Never, never give up."" My personal experience has shown me that persistence and perseverance are essential for achieving one's goals, and I believe that this mindset is crucial for success in all areas of life."
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;The debate about whether it's better to enjoy one's money now or save it for the future has been ongoing for years. In recent years, a significant trend has emerged in developed countries, where the majority of people have a low saving rate. Many individuals opt to spend their earnings immediately or even take loans to finance their expenses. However, in my opinion, saving some part of one's earnings is essential due to the unpredictability of future developments.On one hand, spending one's earnings can provide immediate gratification and enjoyment. It allows individuals to take advantage of opportunities and experiences that may not be available in the future. For instance, traveling, learning a new skill, or pursuing a hobby can enrich one's life and create lasting memories. Moreover, spending can also boost economic growth by increasing demand for goods and services.On the other hand, saving for the future provides a safety net for unforeseen circumstances. Life is full of uncertainties, and unexpected expenses can arise at any moment. Medical emergencies, job losses, or natural disasters can be financially devastating if one is not prepared. Having a savings cushion can help individuals navigate these challenges with greater ease and reduce financial stress. Furthermore, saving can also provide long-term benefits, such as retirement security, wealth accumulation, and increased financial independence.In conclusion, while enjoying one's money now can provide immediate benefits, saving some part of one's earnings is crucial for preparing for the uncertainties of the future. It is essential to strike a balance between spending and saving, as excessive spending can lead to financial vulnerability, while excessive saving can lead to missed opportunities. By prioritizing savings and making it a habit, individuals can ensure a more secure and prosperous financial future.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;In today's fast-paced world, people are often divided into two groups: those who rush through life and those who prefer to take their time. While some individuals thrive in a hurried environment, I firmly believe that living life at a slower pace is essential for one's well-being. In my opinion, the importance of adopting a slower pace cannot be overstated, especially in the face of modern technologies and globalization, which have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously.Living in a hurry comes with several disadvantages. Firstly, it is extremely stressful and can have severe consequences on one's health. When we rush through life, we tend to neglect our physical and mental health. We skip meals, forget to exercise, and sacrifice sleep, all of which can lead to serious health problems. For instance, research has shown that chronic stress can lead to anxiety, depression, and even cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, living at a slower pace allows us to prioritize our health and well-being. We can take time to cook nutritious meals, engage in physical activities, and get enough rest.Furthermore, living life at a slower pace enables us to appreciate the beauty around us and foster meaningful relationships. When we rush, we often overlook the small joys in life, such as a beautiful sunset or a good conversation with a friend. By slowing down, we can cultivate stronger bonds with others and develop a greater sense of gratitude for the world around us. In conclusion, while some people may thrive in a fast-paced environment, I firmly believe that living life at a slower pace is essential for one's health, relationships, and overall well-being. By adopting a slower pace, we can lead more balanced, happy, and fulfilling lives.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;As the global population continues to soar, exceeding seven billion for the first time in history, the debate over prioritizing human needs versus saving land for endangered animals has intensified. While some argue that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry supersede conservation efforts, I firmly disagree. In my opinion, preserving natural habitats and ecosystems is crucial for the well-being of both humans and animals.In the past centuries, the steady growth of the population has led to the destruction of natural habitats, such as forests, jungles, and lakes. As we destroy these ecosystems, we rob ourselves of essential resources and disrupt the delicate balance of nature. The consequences of this destruction are far-reaching, with pollution being a major contributor to the deterioration of weather conditions on our planet. The alarming rate of climate change, resulting from human activities, is a stark reminder of the importance of preserving natural habitats.Moreover, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for regulating weather patterns. Forests, for instance, play a crucial role in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide, while jungles support rainfall patterns. By destroying these ecosystems, we not only harm endangered animals but also jeopardize our own survival.Rather than viewing human needs and conservation as mutually exclusive, we should strive to find a balance between the two. Sustainable development, which incorporates environmental considerations into urban planning and agriculture, can help alleviate the pressure on natural habitats. Furthermore, investing in renewable energy sources and reducing pollution can mitigate the devastating impact of human activities on the environment.In conclusion, saving land for endangered animals is not a luxury, but a necessity. By preserving natural habitats, we ensure a stable and sustainable environment, which is essential for the well-being of both humans and animals. As the global population continues to grow, it is imperative that we prioritize conservation efforts and adopt sustainable practices to safeguard the future of our planet.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;The question of whether university students should be required to attend classes or not has sparked intense debate. While some students believe that attending classes is crucial for academic success, others see it as an optional activity. According to my opinion, since university represents a higher level of education, students have matured enough to make their own choices.To begin with, attending classes can sometimes be a waste of time. Some lecturers simply read from the slides or handouts, which can be easily done at home. In such cases, students might not find it beneficial to spend their time in a classroom, especially if they have other academic or personal commitments to attend to. Moreover, with the advancement of technology, online resources such as recorded lectures, e-books, and online tutorials have made it possible for students to learn at their own pace.However, there are some lecturers who deliver lectures in a very informative and interesting way. These educators bring their subjects to life, provide real-life examples, and encourage class discussions and debates. For students, attending such classes is not only mandatory but also highly beneficial. Interacting with the lecturer and fellow students helps in clarifying doubts, gaining new insights, and developing critical thinking skills.In conclusion, considering the maturity level of university students, I believe that attending classes should be optional. While it is true that some classes can be highly informative and engaging, it is equally true that students have different learning styles and preferences. Some might prefer self-study, while others might thrive in a classroom environment. Ultimately, it is up to each student to decide how they want to manage their time and learning process. By making attendance optional, universities can give students the autonomy to make their own choices and take responsibility for their own learning.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with one another. With the rapid pace of technological advancements, many people are often confronted with the dilemma of whether technology simplifies or complicates their lives. While it is true that technology can be overwhelming and complicated in some aspects, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks, making our lives significantly simpler.On the one hand, it is conceded that technology can be complex and frustrating at times. The constant stream of information, the need to keep up with the latest software updates, and the risk of cyber security breaches can be daunting. Moreover, the over-reliance on technology can lead to a decline in face-to-face communication skills and deep thinking abilities. However, these complications are far outweighed by the numerous ways in which technology simplifies our lives.For instance, technology has made communication faster and more convenient than ever before. With the rise of social media, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools, staying in touch with friends and family across the globe has become effortless. Moreover, technology has simplified the way we access information, shop, and manage our finances. Online banking, e-commerce, and search engines have saved us time, energy, and resources, making our lives more efficient and streamlined.Furthermore, technology has improved our productivity and work-life balance. With the ability to work remotely, access files from anywhere, and automate tasks, we can manage our work and personal responsibilities more effectively. In conclusion, while technology may present some complexities, its benefits in terms of convenience, efficiency, and productivity far outweigh its drawbacks. Therefore, I firmly believe that technology makes people's lives simpler, rather than more complicated.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";The rise of mass media has undoubtedly led to a shift in the type of content being consumed by the public. The statement that television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people is one that I strongly agree with. Mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons, but ultimately, it is their desire for increased audience and readership that drives this focus.Television and newspapers, in particular, focus on famous people's lives in order to increase their audience or readership. This is because stories about celebrities and public figures are often sensationalized and attention-grabbing, allowing media outlets to boost their ratings and circulation. By dedicating a disproportionate amount of coverage to the personal lives of famous people, media outlets are able to attract a larger audience and stay ahead of the competition.However, I believe that there is a deeper societal issue at play here. We live in a society where appearance and gossip are often valued above substance and meaningful content. This is reflected in the way that mass media prioritizes coverage of celebrity scandals and romantic relationships over more serious issues like politics and social justice. By perpetuating this culture of superficiality, mass media outlets are contributing to a society that values the wrong things.In conclusion, I strongly agree that television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people. This focus is driven by a desire for increased audience and readership, but also reflects a broader societal issue. By valuing substance over superficiality, we can work towards creating a more meaningful and informed public discourse.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;As a lifelong resident of this charming small town, I have always been drawn to the comfort and familiarity that comes with staying in one place. Born and raised here, I have had the privilege of developing strong relationships with a close-knit community of friends, who have become an integral part of my life. The ease of navigating the town's streets, the warmth of the local culture, and the picturesque environment have all contributed to my deep affection for this place.One of the aspects I love most about our town is its tranquil atmosphere. The gentle pace of life, the minimal traffic, and the overall sense of calm create an ideal setting for relaxation and personal growth. In contrast, I have heard stories from friends who have moved to bigger cities in search of new opportunities, only to find themselves overwhelmed by the fast-paced and often chaotic environment. The stress and anxiety that come with navigating unfamiliar streets, finding new social circles, and adapting to a new lifestyle are not something I envy.Moreover, I strongly believe that staying in one place allows for a sense of continuity and stability that is essential for personal development. By staying in one place, I have been able to cultivate long-term relationships, pursue hobbies and interests without interruption, and feel a deep connection to my community. In my opinion, the benefits of staying in one place far outweigh the benefits of moving in search of another place. While I acknowledge that new experiences and challenges can be valuable, I firmly believe that the comfort, familiarity, and sense of belonging that come with staying in one place make it the better choice for me.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;The decision of where to live during university years is a crucial one, as it can significantly impact a student's academic, social, and personal growth. Two popular options available to students are living in university dormitories and living in apartments in the community. Both options have their advantages, and in this essay, we will compare and contrast these advantages, and ultimately, determine which option is preferable.On the one hand, living in university dormitories has its benefits. For one, it helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university, making it easier for them to navigate the campus and get accustomed to the university's rules and regulations. Additionally, dormitories provide students with a sense of community and belonging, as they are surrounded by fellow students who share similar interests and goals. University dormitories also offer various support services, such as tutoring, counseling, and academic advising, which can be incredibly beneficial for students.On the other hand, living in an apartment in the community has its own set of advantages. For instance, it prepares students for real life, teaching them essential life skills such as independence, responsibility, and time management. Students who live off-campus are more likely to develop a sense of self-reliance and self-motivation, as they are required to take care of themselves and manage their daily routines without the constant supervision of university staff. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. Moreover, living off-campus provides students with the opportunity to interact with people from different backgrounds, cultures, and age groups, broadening their social circles and enhancing their communication skills.Based on these advantages, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community. While living in university dormitories provides a sense of security and convenience, I believe that living off-campus offers more opportunities for personal growth, independence, and real-life experience. By living in an apartment, students can develop essential life skills, such as cooking, cleaning, and budgeting, which will benefit them in the long run. Furthermore, living off-campus provides students with the flexibility to create their own schedules and routines, allowing them to balance their academic, social, and personal responsibilities more effectively.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;In today's fast-paced world, the age-old debate about the importance of speed versus accuracy in the workplace has gained significant attention. While some argue that working slowly and ensuring everything is correct is the key to success, I agree with the statement that in today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal of achieving perfection. In many industries, such as technology and finance, speed is crucial to staying ahead of the competition. By working quickly, individuals can complete tasks more efficiently, allowing them to take on more projects and responsibilities. This, in turn, provides them with more opportunities to learn and study, enabling them to improve their skills and knowledge. For instance, a software developer who works rapidly can complete multiple projects in a short span, giving them the chance to study and learn from their mistakes, ultimately leading to personal and professional growth.Moreover, with the rising expenses in today's world, individuals are often forced to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. By working quickly and efficiently, people can manage to work in two or three firms in a week, juggling multiple responsibilities and increasing their earning potential. This is especially true for freelancers, consultants, and entrepreneurs who need to manage multiple clients and projects simultaneously.On the other hand, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks and responsibilities, limiting their career advancement and earning potential. In today's fast-paced work environment, employers value employees who can work efficiently and effectively, completing tasks quickly without compromising on quality. Those who work slowly may find themselves struggling to keep up with the demands of their job, leading to frustration and stagnation.In conclusion, while accuracy and attention to detail are important, working quickly and risking mistakes is more important in today's world. By embracing this approach, individuals can increase their productivity, learning opportunities, and career advancement, ultimately leading to personal and professional success.
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;"I disagree with the notion that it is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam. The idea that students can bypass classes and still acquire university knowledge is not entirely accurate. While it is true that some students may not be experts in every part of a subject, attending classes provides a comprehensive learning experience that goes beyond mere knowledge acquisition.Attending classes allows students to engage with the subject matter in a more nuanced and multifaceted way. Lectures, discussions, and interactions with professors and peers provide opportunities for students to ask questions, clarify doubts, and gain a deeper understanding of complex concepts. Moreover, classes offer a structured learning environment where students can develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration skills, which are essential for academic and professional success.Furthermore, the notion that students can acquire university knowledge without attending classes overlooks the importance of social learning and community engagement. Classes provide a space for students to connect with others who share similar interests and passions, fostering a sense of belonging and motivation. This social aspect of learning is particularly important for students who may be new to a subject or field, as it helps them navigate unfamiliar terrain and build confidence.While it is possible for students to pass exams without attending classes, this approach can lead to a superficial understanding of the subject matter. University education is not just about passing exams; it is about cultivating a deeper understanding of the world, developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and preparing students for a lifetime of learning and growth. Attending classes is an essential part of this process, and I firmly believe that it is necessary for university students to attend classes, even if they can pass exams without doing so."
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;University education is always an important part of one's life. As a vital part of the educational journey, it lays the foundation for future success and plays a significant role in shaping individuals into responsible and informed members of society. In recent years, there has been an ongoing debate about how to improve the quality of university education, with some arguing that universities should spend more money on salaries for professors. While professors are essential to the educational process, I disagree with this statement.While professors are the backbone of the educational system, the primary focus of universities should always be on the students. The best way to orientate students is by providing them with a conducive learning environment, equipped with modern facilities and updated resources. Spending money on salaries for professors alone may not necessarily translate to improved educational quality. In fact, investing in facilities such as libraries, laboratories, and recreational spaces can have a more direct impact on students' learning experiences.Furthermore, updating resources such as textbooks, technology, and online platforms can also greatly enhance the quality of education. These investments can provide students with hands-on experience, expose them to new ideas and perspectives, and better prepare them for the demands of the modern workforce. By prioritizing the needs of students, universities can create an environment that fosters intellectual growth, creativity, and innovation.In conclusion, while professors are essential to the educational process, I believe that universities should prioritize spending on facilities and resources that directly benefit students. By doing so, universities can create an environment that is conducive to learning, growth, and success, ultimately leading to improved educational quality.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;The notion that pets should be treated like family members has sparked a heated debate. While some people wholeheartedly agree with this statement, others vehemently disagree, arguing that pets are merely animals that lack the capacity for complex thought processes. However, I firmly believe that pets should indeed be treated like family members, and for good reason.First and foremost, pets are our companions, often providing us with unwavering loyalty and companionship. They listen to us, respond to our emotions, and offer comfort in times of need. In many cases, pets prove to be better listeners than some human beings, who may be too busy or too self-absorbed to lend a sympathetic ear. For instance, talking to pets can be a therapeutic outlet for people to express their feelings, and pets will often respond with affection and empathy.Secondly, pets have proven to be incredibly useful in a variety of ways. One notable example is pet therapy, which has gained immense popularity in recent years. Trained therapy pets are now being used in hospitals, nursing homes, and rehabilitation centers to provide emotional support and comfort to patients. The benefits of pet therapy are undeniable, with studies showing that it can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression in individuals. Moreover, pets can also assist people with disabilities, such as guide dogs for the visually impaired or hearing dogs for the hearing impaired.In conclusion, pets are far more than just animals - they are our friends, companions, and often, our lifelines. Their ability to listen, comfort, and assist us makes them an integral part of our families.
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;When it comes to choosing the ideal place to live, people often find themselves torn between the charm of small towns and the vibrancy of big cities. As for me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, a personal attitude shaped by many factors.Firstly, I find the excitement of big cities to be utterly attractive. Living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience, where every day brings something new. From the sound of traffic and chatter to the endless options of entertainment and cultural activities, big cities are always alive. The diverse range of people, food, and events creates a unique and thrilling atmosphere that is hard to find in smaller towns. The excitement of big cities is not just about noise and activity, but about the opportunities to engage with people from different backgrounds and cultures, learn from them, and grow as an individual.Secondly, big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a higher chance of a higher income than small towns do. Cities are hubs for various industries, and the job market is more competitive and diverse. This diversity allows individuals to explore different career paths and find what suits them best. Furthermore, the higher cost of living in cities is often offset by higher salaries, making it possible to enjoy a better quality of life. In contrast, small towns often have limited job opportunities, and career advancement can be restricted.In conclusion, for me, the choice between living in a big city and a small town is clear. The excitement and opportunities that big cities offer make them the ideal place to live. While small towns may have their charm, the benefits of city living far outweigh them, making big cities the perfect choice for those who crave a dynamic and fulfilling lifestyle.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";I disagree with the statement that it is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.On the one hand, the government should prioritize the construction of new buildings to meet the basic needs of its citizens. Building more accommodating constructions, such as apartments and houses, provides people with a decent place to live in. In a society where everyone has a roof over their heads, people can live in harmony and have a sense of security and stability. This, in turn, contributes to the overall well-being and happiness of the citizens.On the other hand, preserving historic or traditional buildings and homes is also crucial. These buildings are a part of the country's cultural heritage and play an important role in shaping the nation's identity. They serve as a reminder of the past and provide a glimpse into the lives of our ancestors. By preserving these buildings, the government can promote cultural tourism, create jobs, and stimulate local economies.In conclusion, while building new constructions is important to meet the basic needs of citizens, preserving historic or traditional buildings and homes is equally crucial for promoting cultural heritage and national identity. The government should strike a balance between the two and allocate funds accordingly.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;I strongly agree with the statement that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. This notion resonates with me, as I firmly believe that every challenging experience we encounter plays a pivotal role in shaping our personal and professional growth.In my opinion, the primary reason why difficult experiences become valuable lessons is that they enhance our skillset and decision-making abilities. When we navigate through tough situations, we are compelled to think critically and devise innovative solutions to overcome obstacles. This process of trial and error enables us to develop our problem-solving skills, making us more adept at tackling similar challenges in the future. For instance, a student who faces difficulties in mastering a new language may initially feel frustrated, but as they persist and eventually grasp the language, they become proficient and develop a valuable skill that can benefit them in various aspects of their life.Another significant advantage of difficult experiences is that they inadvertently make us more resilient and robust. When we face adversity, our initial response may be to feel overwhelmed and vulnerable. However, as we work through the challenges, we begin to build our emotional strength and develop coping mechanisms that enable us to navigate through tough times. This resilience, in turn, empowers us to confront future challenges with confidence and poise. For example, an individual who has experienced a job loss may initially feel defeated, but as they work through the setback, they develop a stronger sense of self-reliance and learn to adapt to new situations.In conclusion, I firmly believe that difficult experiences are essential for our personal and professional growth. Every challenging experience we encounter makes us more skilled, improves our decision-making abilities, and builds our resilience. By embracing these experiences, we can transform what seems like a setback into a valuable lesson that can benefit us in the long run.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";"The debate on whether drivers should pay a fee for driving in busy city streets during peak hours has sparked intense discussion. Critics have castigated drivers for their role in exacerbating traffic congestion, with some arguing that they should be charged an extra fee for their supposedly ""selfish"" conduct. However, I firmly disagree with this notion.In my opinion, imposing an additional fee on drivers during rush hour is not only unfair but also impractical. Firstly, traffic congestion is an inevitable and natural phenomenon that arises from the sheer volume of people commuting to and from work. It is not something that drivers can control or avoid. No matter how carefully they plan their routes or departure times, they are often at the mercy of circumstances beyond their control.Moreover, drivers are already paying a significant amount in terms of fuel, maintenance, and vehicle wear and tear due to the stop-and-go nature of traffic during peak hours. Adding an extra fee would only serve to further burden them financially, without providing any tangible solutions to the problem of congestion.Rather than penalizing drivers, cities should focus on investing in infrastructure and public transportation systems that can help alleviate congestion. This could include expanding public transportation options, optimizing traffic light timings, and implementing intelligent traffic management systems.In conclusion, while I understand the frustration with traffic congestion, I firmly believe that drivers should not be charged an additional fee for driving during peak hours. Instead, we should focus on finding more constructive and equitable solutions to this complex problem."
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";Title: The Value of Part-Time Jobs in Preparing Teenagers for AdulthoodAs teenagers transition into adulthood, they face numerous challenges that require them to be independent, responsible, and self-sufficient. While parents play a crucial role in guiding their children through this transition, one effective way to prepare them for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job. I firmly believe that part-time employment is an invaluable experience that allows teenagers to grasp the realities of adult life, making it an essential aspect of their development.One of the primary advantages of part-time jobs is that they provide teenagers with a taste of real-life experiences. Parents often warn their children that adult life is far more demanding than school life, but without firsthand experience, it is difficult for teenagers to fully comprehend the level of responsibility and pressure that comes with adulthood. By working part-time, teenagers can gain a deeper understanding of the expectations and challenges that they will face in their future careers. This exposure can help them develop essential skills such as time management, communication, and problem-solving, which are vital for success in any profession.In contrast to spending their free time playing computer games, part-time jobs offer a more productive and enriching way for teenagers to spend their holidays. Not only do part-time jobs provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, but they also offer a chance to earn money, develop a work ethic, and build confidence. Furthermore, part-time jobs can help teenagers discover their passions and interests, guiding them towards a career path that aligns with their strengths and aspirations.In conclusion, encouraging teenagers to take part-time jobs is one of the best ways parents can prepare them for adult life. By experiencing the realities of work, developing essential skills, and gaining a sense of responsibility, teenagers can transition into adulthood with confidence and poise. As a result, I firmly agree that part-time jobs are an invaluable investment in a teenager's future, providing them with the tools and knowledge necessary to thrive in an increasingly competitive world.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is the pattern of work that one tends to choose while studying. As for me, I favor individual study over group study, and this preference stems from several reasons.To begin with, my type of temperament is one of the primary reasons that make me choose individual work instead of team work. Being an introverted person, I tend to be more productive and focused when I study alone. I find that group study settings often involve a lot of distractions, such as side conversations and conflicting opinions, which hinder my ability to concentrate. In contrast, individual study allows me to create a conducive environment that suits my learning style, enabling me to grasp concepts more effectively.Another reason I prefer individual study is that it enables me to work at my own pace. In a group setting, I may feel pressured to keep up with others or wait for them to catch up, which can be frustrating and inefficient. When I study alone, I can allocate my time and energy as I see fit, allowing me to make the most of my study sessions. Furthermore, individual study encourages me to take ownership of my learning, as I am solely responsible for my progress and outcomes. This sense of accountability motivates me to stay on track and strive for excellence.While some students may thrive in group study environments, I firmly believe that individual study is the best approach for me. By working alone, I can tailor my study routine to my unique needs and preferences, ultimately leading to more effective learning and better academic outcomes.
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;When it comes to employment options, people often find themselves at a crossroads, weighing the pros and cons of being self-employed, working for someone else, or owning a business. Despite the potential problems that come with each option, personally, I would prefer to have my own job.First and foremost, time is the most valuable thing I have in my life, and being my own boss would allow me to manage it more effectively. As a self-employed individual, I would have the flexibility to set my own schedule, allowing me to prioritize tasks, and allocate time according to my needs. This flexibility would also enable me to pursue other interests and hobbies, leading to a better work-life balance.Second, earning money is the fundamental reason why people work, and the amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. Being self-employed would give me the opportunity to earn unlimited income, as my earnings would be directly tied to my efforts and creativity. In contrast, when working for someone else, my earning potential is limited to my salary or hourly wage, which may not reflect the true value I bring to the organization. By owning my own business, I would be able to capitalize on my skills and expertise, potentially leading to greater financial rewards.In addition, being self-employed would give me the autonomy to make decisions, take risks, and pursue opportunities that align with my passions and values. While there are potential drawbacks to being self-employed, such as financial uncertainty and increased responsibility, I believe that the benefits of having my own job far outweigh the costs.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";The preservation of old, historic buildings in cities is a topic of much debate. While some argue that these buildings should be destroyed and replaced with modern structures, I firmly believe that they should be preserved and protected. Historic buildings are not just mere structures, but are important treasures that provide a window into the past, offering valuable lessons and insights into the lives of people who lived thousands of years ago.These buildings serve as a tangible link to our heritage, allowing us to understand the culture, customs, and lifestyles of previous generations. For instance, the ancient city of Pompeii in Italy, which was frozen in time by the devastating volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius, provides a unique glimpse into daily life in ancient Rome. Similarly, the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, with its stunning architecture and intricate designs, offers a glimpse into the lives of Chinese emperors and their courtiers.Moreover, historic buildings can also play a significant role in developing tourism industries, attracting millions of visitors each year. Cities like Paris, Rome, and Barcelona, with their rich cultural heritage and well-preserved historic buildings, are among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. The Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Colosseum in Rome, and La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, are just a few examples of iconic buildings that draw tourists from all over the globe, generating significant revenue for local economies.In addition to their cultural and economic significance, historic buildings can also serve as a source of inspiration for architects, designers, and artists. By studying and preserving these structures, we can gain a deeper understanding of the design principles, materials, and techniques used in their construction, which can inform and influence contemporary design.In conclusion, preserving old, historic buildings is essential for maintaining our cultural heritage, promoting tourism, and inspiring future generations of architects and designers. Rather than destroying them and replacing them with modern buildings, cities should strive to protect and restore these valuable structures, ensuring that they continue to stand as testaments to our rich history and cultural diversity.
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;"The statement ""Parents are the best teachers"" has sparked a longstanding debate among many individuals. While some people firmly believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teaching, others disagree. In my opinion, I concur with the former, and I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my stance.From the moment we are born, our parents play a pivotal role in shaping our lives. They teach us the most basic yet essential things, such as how to smile, walk, and perform ordinary routines like eating. As we grow bigger, their role as teachers becomes even more significant. They impart valuable ethical lessons that have a lasting impact on our lives. For instance, they teach us the importance of honesty, respect, and responsibility, which are crucial for our development into responsible individuals.One of the primary reasons why I believe parents are the best teachers is that we spend most of our time at home with our families, rather than at school. This prolonged exposure allows them to have a profound influence on our behavior, values, and beliefs. Unlike teachers at school, who may only see us for a few hours a day, parents are able to observe and guide us throughout our daily lives. They can correct our mistakes, encourage our strengths, and provide us with the emotional support we need to grow and thrive.In conclusion, while some may argue that parents are not the best teachers, I firmly believe that they play a vital role in our education and development. From teaching us basic skills to imparting important life lessons, parents are always there to guide us. With their unwavering support and influence, it is no wonder that many people consider them to be the best teachers of all."
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;I agree with the statement that in order to succeed in a new job, the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of the job. While having excellent knowledge of the job is crucial, it is the ability to adapt that sets the foundation for success.Research has proven that adaptability is a key aspect of job performance. It enables individuals to navigate unfamiliar surroundings, build relationships with new colleagues, and understand the company culture. Adaptability is a short-term necessity, but it has long-term benefits. When an individual can adapt quickly, they can focus on developing their skills and knowledge, leading to greater job satisfaction and productivity.On the other hand, working independently with excellent knowledge of the job is a longer-term aspect of job performance. While it is true that excellent knowledge of the job will benefit an individual throughout their career, it is not as crucial in the initial stages of a new job. In fact, excellent knowledge can be developed over time, but if an individual is unable to adapt to the new environment, they may struggle to apply their knowledge effectively.Moreover, a company benefits from every worker having excellent knowledge of their job, but it is the adaptable employees who can respond to changing circumstances, collaborate with others, and drive innovation. In today's fast-paced and dynamic work environments, adaptability is essential for individuals to thrive and for companies to stay competitive.In conclusion, while excellent knowledge of the job is important, the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is more crucial for success in a new job. Adaptability sets the foundation for learning, growth, and productivity, and it is essential for individuals and companies to navigate the challenges of an ever-changing work environment.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;The advent of computers has brought about a significant impact on modern life, with some people hailing them as a boon and others viewing them as a bane. While I acknowledge the validity of both perspectives, my opinion is that computers have made life easier and more convenient, despite some drawbacks. Computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other parts of societies, transforming the way we live, work, and interact.One of the primary advantages of computers is their ability to automate repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency and productivity. In many industries, such as manufacturing, banking, and healthcare, computers have reduced the need for human labor, freeing up time for more complex and creative tasks. For instance, computerized accounting systems have replaced manual bookkeeping, allowing accountants to focus on financial analysis and planning. Similarly, online banking has reduced the need for physical bank branches, making banking services more accessible and convenient.However, it is undeniable that the rise of computers has also led to the displacement of certain jobs. With automation and artificial intelligence, some roles have become redundant, leaving workers without employment. For example, the introduction of self-service kiosks in restaurants and supermarkets has reduced the need for human cashiers. Furthermore, the increased reliance on computers has also created new stressors, such as the pressure to constantly update skills and deal with technical issues.Despite these challenges, I firmly believe that the benefits of computers far outweigh the drawbacks. Computers have opened up new avenues for communication, education, and innovation, enabling people to connect with each other and access vast amounts of information. Moreover, computers have enabled businesses to operate more efficiently, reducing costs and improving customer service.In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly made life more complex and stressful in some ways, their overall impact has been positive. By embracing the benefits of computers and addressing the challenges they present, we can harness their potential to create a more convenient, efficient, and productive society.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;I strongly agree with the statement that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Acquiring a foreign language at a young age is not only beneficial for their cognitive development but also broadens their understanding of diverse cultures and perspectives.Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Research has shown that children who learn a second language at a young age perform better academically and have improved cognitive skills. This is because learning a foreign language enhances their memory, concentration, and problem-solving abilities. For instance, a study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that students who studied a foreign language scored higher on standardized tests, such as the SAT, compared to those who did not.Moreover, learning a foreign language not only helps children improve their minds and memories but can also extend their visions about other countries. By studying a foreign language, children gain insight into the culture, customs, and history of the country associated with the language. This can foster a deeper appreciation and understanding of global diversity, allowing children to become more empathetic and open-minded individuals. For example, a child learning Spanish may develop an interest in Latin American culture, leading them to explore the rich history, literature, and art of the region.In conclusion, introducing foreign language learning at the onset of schooling is a valuable investment in a child's educational journey. It not only enhances their cognitive abilities but also expands their cultural awareness and appreciation. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the ability to communicate across linguistic and cultural boundaries will become a vital skill, and by starting early, children can reap the numerous benefits of foreign language learning.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;I disagree with the statement that boys and girls should attend separate schools. In my opinion, studying together in a co-educational setting provides numerous benefits for both boys and girls, preparing them for a lifetime of interactions with the opposite sex.One of the primary advantages of co-education is that it allows boys and girls to learn how to interact with each other in a natural and respectful manner. By studying together, they have the opportunity to get to know each other, learn how to behave with the opposite sex, and develop essential social skills. A boy, for instance, will learn how to speak with a girl in various situations, from casual conversations to more formal discussions, and vice versa. This helps to break down social barriers and fosters a deeper understanding and respect for one another.On the other hand, some experts argue that attending the same school can cause many disadvantages for boys and girls, such as distractions, social conflicts, and decreased academic performance. However, I believe that these issues can be effectively addressed through proper guidance, supervision, and education. In fact, many co-educational schools have implemented measures to minimize these problems and promote a positive learning environment.In conclusion, I firmly believe that boys and girls should study together in the same school. Not only does it provide them with essential social skills, but it also prepares them for a lifetime of interactions with the opposite sex. By learning how to interact with each other in a respectful and natural manner, boys and girls can develop into well-rounded, confident, and socially adept individuals.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";"The concept of success has been debated by many, with some attributing it to taking risks and others to careful planning. In my opinion, success is a combination of both, but it is the willingness to take risks that ultimately sets the foundation for achieving one's goals.As Aristotle once said, ""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" This quote highlights the importance of stepping out of one's comfort zone and embracing uncertainty. Many people are afraid to take risks and face the possibility of failure, but it is precisely this fear that holds them back from reaching their full potential. On the other hand, those who are willing to take risks and learn from their mistakes are more likely to achieve success.A prime example of this is Walt Disney, whose career was marked by numerous failures and setbacks. Despite being fired from a newspaper job for ""lacking creativity,"" Disney persevered and went on to create some of the most iconic animated films of all time. His determination and willingness to take risks led him to revolutionize the entertainment industry and become a household name.Careful planning, however, also plays a crucial role in achieving success. It is essential to have a clear vision and strategy in place to guide one's efforts. Nevertheless, planning alone is not enough. It is the courage to take risks and adapt to changing circumstances that ultimately sets successful individuals apart from those who remain stuck in their comfort zones.In conclusion, while careful planning is essential, it is the willingness to take risks that truly drives success. By embracing uncertainty and learning from failures, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve their dreams."
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";I completely agree with the statement that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. This is a basic part of life, and it is essential to accept that not every task or activity will be enjoyable. In fact, many aspects of our personal and professional lives require us to do things that we may not particularly enjoy.In professional settings, for instance, there are numerous tasks that are necessary parts of the job but may not be enjoyable. Attending boring conferences, working with difficult colleagues, or completing tedious paperwork are just a few examples. However, these tasks are often crucial to the smooth operation of a business or organization, and neglecting them can have negative consequences. By doing these tasks, individuals can ensure the success of their organization and advance their careers.Moreover, doing something that an individual does not really enjoy can sometimes lead to enjoyment. For example, a person who dislikes public speaking may be required to give presentations at work. Initially, they may find this task daunting and unpleasant. However, as they practice and become more confident, they may discover a hidden talent and even begin to enjoy the experience of sharing their ideas with others. Similarly, a person who dislikes exercising may be required to do so for health reasons. As they continue to exercise, they may find that they start to enjoy the physical and mental benefits that come with it.In conclusion, people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. This is an inevitable part of life, and it is essential to accept that not every task or activity will be enjoyable. By doing things that we may not enjoy, we can ensure our personal and professional success, and may even discover new sources of enjoyment.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;The question of when young adults should leave their parents' home is a contentious one, with some arguing that independence should be achieved as soon as possible, while others prefer to live with their families for a longer time. In my opinion, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.On the one hand, it is natural for young adults to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. Living independently allows them to take responsibility for their own decisions and actions, which can be a valuable learning experience. However, I believe that this desire for independence should not come at the expense of their financial and emotional stability.On the other hand, living with parents for a longer time has numerous benefits. For one, it allows young adults to save money on living expenses, which can be used to pay off student loans or invest in their future. Additionally, living with parents provides a sense of security and support, which can be especially important during times of uncertainty or stress. Moreover, it gives young adults the opportunity to develop important life skills, such as cooking, cleaning, and managing finances, under the guidance of their parents.Personally, I think that the benefits of living with parents for a longer time outweigh the benefits of independence. Young adults who live with their parents for a longer time are more likely to achieve financial stability, develop important life skills, and have a sense of security and support. While independence is important, I believe that it should not be achieved at the expense of one's financial and emotional well-being.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way people interact with each other, leading to a significant shift in the types of relationships formed over the past hundred years. In my opinion, this development has been overwhelmingly positive, despite some drawbacks.To begin with, technology has made it easier than ever to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places. With the rise of social media, video conferencing, and instant messaging apps, geographical distances are no longer a barrier to maintaining relationships. This has enabled people to stay connected with friends and family who may be physically distant, fostering a sense of community and togetherness.Moreover, technology has opened up new avenues for people to meet and form relationships. Online platforms and social media have enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests, hobbies, or passions, leading to the formation of new friendships and communities. This has been particularly beneficial for people who may be isolated or have difficulty forming relationships in person, such as those with disabilities or living in remote areas.However, it is also important to acknowledge some of the negative consequences of technology on relationships. The rise of social media has led to the proliferation of superficial relationships, where people present curated versions of themselves online, rather than engaging in meaningful, face-to-face interactions. Additionally, the constant availability of technology can lead to an expectation of instant responses, creating a sense of urgency and stress in relationships.Despite these drawbacks, I firmly believe that the benefits of technology on relationships far outweigh the costs. Technology has democratized communication, enabling people to connect with others across the globe, and fostering a sense of global citizenship. As we continue to navigate the complexities of technology and relationships, it is essential to strike a balance between the benefits of technology and the importance of meaningful, human interaction.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The increasing use and development of new technology has led to a significant shift in the way work is performed. Many machines are now capable of doing tasks that were previously done by humans. This trend has both advantages and disadvantages.On the one hand, machines are undoubtedly bringing many benefits to society. For one thing, machines are more effective than humans. Unlike humans, machines do not need rest, which means they can work for as long as employers want, consistently producing high-quality products without mistakes. This has led to a significant increase in productivity and efficiency in various industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. Additionally, machines can perform tasks that are repetitive, boring, or hazardous, freeing up human workers to focus on more complex and creative tasks.On the other hand, there are also some disadvantages to this trend. One major concern is the loss of jobs. As machines take over tasks that were previously done by humans, many workers are facing the risk of unemployment. This can have serious consequences, particularly in industries where machines are replacing entire workforces. Furthermore, the increased reliance on machines can also lead to a lack of skills and knowledge among human workers, making it difficult for them to adapt to new technologies and innovations.In conclusion, while machines are undoubtedly bringing many benefits to society, it is important to consider the potential disadvantages of this trend. It is crucial for governments, industries, and individuals to work together to mitigate the negative effects of automation and ensure that the benefits of technology are shared by all. This can include investing in education and training programs, as well as implementing policies to protect workers who are displaced by machines.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;The field of information technology (IT) has witnessed tremendous growth over the past two decades, revolutionizing the way we communicate and access information. The World Wide Web and email have been instrumental in bridging geographical gaps and facilitating global connectivity. However, there is a growing concern that future developments in IT may have more negative consequences than benefits. While I agree that there are potential downsides to IT advancements, I also believe that the positive impacts will continue to outweigh the negative effects.Every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers, laptops, and tablets, which have an incredible resolution. These innovations have transformed the way we learn, work, and interact with each other. For instance, online educational resources have made learning more accessible and convenient, while video conferencing has enabled remote communication, saving time and resources. Moreover, the widespread adoption of IT has led to significant economic growth, job creation, and improved healthcare outcomes.However, there are some negative aspects of information technology that cannot be ignored. The excessive use of IT devices has led to concerns about screen time, social isolation, and decreased attention span. Furthermore, the rapid pace of IT development has created new challenges, such as cybersecurity threats, data breaches, and the digital divide. These issues need to be addressed through responsible innovation, education, and policy-making.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the negative impacts of future IT developments, I believe that the benefits will continue to outweigh the drawbacks. By acknowledging the potential risks and taking proactive measures to mitigate them, we can ensure that IT advancements contribute to a brighter, more connected future.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;The proliferation of celebrity news and gossip has become an integral part of modern media, with many people voicing concerns about its potential impact on children. In my opinion, the extensive media coverage of celebrities can indeed have a negative effect on children, and I agree with this sentiment to a considerable extent.On one hand, the intense scrutiny of celebrities can serve as a double-edged sword. While it can inspire and motivate children to pursue their passions and interests, it also places a tremendous burden of responsibility on public figures. Their every move is under the microscope, and their actions can have a profound impact on their young admirers. As a result, celebrities must be mindful of the influence they wield and conduct themselves in a manner that is respectful and admirable. This can be a challenging task, especially when considering the immense pressure to maintain a public image.On the other hand, excessive media coverage of celebrities can have a detrimental influence on children's career aspirations. The constant bombardment of glamorous and often unrealistic portrayals of fame can lead children to develop unrealistic expectations about the entertainment industry. Many may be swayed into pursuing a career in the spotlight, not for the love of their craft, but for the promise of fame and fortune. This can result in disappointment and disillusionment when reality fails to live up to their lofty expectations. Furthermore, it can also distract from other, more meaningful and rewarding career paths that may be of greater benefit to society as a whole.In conclusion, while celebrity news and gossip can serve as a harmless form of entertainment for many, its impact on children cannot be ignored. It is crucial for parents, educators, and the media to promote a balanced and realistic understanding of fame and its consequences, as well as to encourage children to explore a wide range of interests and career options.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";The widespread use of mobile phones has undoubtedly brought about numerous benefits, including convenience and entertainment, into our daily lives. People of all ages have seamlessly integrated these devices into their routines, making it an indispensable part of modern life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems that cannot be ignored.In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and rely on their phones, they may lose their interest in daily activities. This can lead to social isolation, where individuals prefer the virtual world to real-life interactions. For instance, many people would rather spend their time scrolling through social media than engaging in face-to-face conversations with friends and family. This not only hinders meaningful relationships but also erodes essential social skills.Furthermore, the continuous use of mobile phones can have severe physical consequences, particularly for children. Prolonged screen time can damage their eyesight, leading to myopia and other vision-related problems. Additionally, the sedentary nature of mobile phone use can result in poor physical posture, contributing to long-term musculoskeletal issues. This is especially alarming, given the crucial role physical activity plays in a child's overall development.In conclusion, while mobile phones have revolutionized the way we live, it is imperative to acknowledge the social problems they pose. It is our responsibility to ensure that we use these devices judiciously, striking a balance between technology and real-life interactions. By doing so, we can harness the benefits of mobile phones while minimizing their detrimental effects on our social fabric.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;The advent of modern forms of communication, such as email and messaging, has revolutionized the way people interact with each other. On one hand, these advancements have made it possible for individuals to connect with others across geographical boundaries and time zones, facilitating global communication without the constraints of time and space. This has enabled people to maintain relationships with friends and acquaintances who may be physically distant, thereby expanding their social circles.On the other hand, I agree that the over-reliance on modern forms of communication has had a negative impact on people's social lives. The ease of sending a message or email can sometimes replace face-to-face interactions, leading to a decline in the quality of relationships. People may spend more time interacting with their screens than engaging in meaningful conversations with friends and family. This can result in feelings of isolation, loneliness, and disconnection, ultimately affecting their mental and emotional well-being.Furthermore, the lack of nonverbal cues and depth in digital communication can lead to misinterpretations and misunderstandings, potentially straining relationships. Additionally, the constant availability of messaging apps can create unrealistic expectations of instant responses, leading to stress and anxiety when these expectations are not met.In conclusion, while modern forms of communication have opened up new avenues for social interaction, it is essential to strike a balance between digital communication and face-to-face interactions. By being mindful of the potential drawbacks of excessive digital communication, people can harness the benefits of modern technology while nurturing their social relationships and overall well-being. Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize that technology is a tool, not a replacement, for human connection.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";The debate on whether to encourage a sense of competition or cooperation in children has been ongoing for years. While some argue that competition fosters confidence and independence, others believe that cooperation breeds innovative thinkers and team players. In this essay, we will delve into the merits of both approaches and explore their implications on children's development.On the one hand, competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle situations independently. Competition drives them to push beyond their limits, strive for excellence, and develop a strong sense of self-reliance. This confidence can translate to various aspects of life, such as academics, sports, and even professional pursuits. Competitive children learn to set goals, work towards them, and take calculated risks, essential skills for success in today's fast-paced world.On the other hand, co-operative children have the potential to structure and implement new and innovative ideas with the help of a team. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate diverse perspectives, share ideas, and build on each other's strengths. This collaborative approach fosters creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability, skills that are highly valued in the modern workplace. By working in teams, children develop essential social skills, such as communication, empathy, and conflict resolution, which are vital for effective teamwork and leadership.Both these factors have their own values, and it is not necessarily a question of either/or. Ideally, children should be encouraged to develop both competitive and cooperative skills. By striking a balance between individual achievement and teamwork, children can develop a unique blend of confidence, creativity, and social skills that will serve them well in all aspects of life. Ultimately, the key is to provide children with a supportive environment that nurtures both their competitive and cooperative instincts, allowing them to grow into well-rounded, capable, and innovative individuals.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;The advent of technology has undoubtedly revolutionized the way people interact with each other, transforming the dynamics of relationships in profound ways. While technology has been blamed for eroding traditional forms of communication and fostering social isolation, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks, positively impacting the relationships people form and maintain.On the one hand, it is undeniable that technology has negative influences in many respects. The proliferation of social media platforms, for instance, has been linked to increased feelings of loneliness and disconnection. The curated online personas people present often create unrealistic expectations and promote comparison, leading to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Furthermore, the ease of digital communication can sometimes lead to shallow relationships, where meaningful interactions are sacrificed for the sake of convenience and brevity.However, I strongly agree that technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. Social media, for example, has enabled people to connect with others across geographical distances, fostering global communities and friendships that transcend borders. Video conferencing tools have also made it possible for people to maintain relationships despite physical distance, ensuring that loved ones can stay in touch regardless of their location. Moreover, technology has provided a platform for people to find and connect with others who share similar interests and passions, facilitating the formation of meaningful relationships that may not have been possible otherwise.In conclusion, while technology has its drawbacks, its positive impact on relationships far outweighs its negative influences. By providing a platform for global connectivity, fostering meaningful relationships, and facilitating communication across distances, technology has revolutionized the way people interact with each other. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that its positive effects on relationships will only continue to grow, enriching our personal and professional lives in ways previously unimaginable.
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;The notion that traditional skills and ways of life become obsolete with the advancement of technology is a topic of ongoing debate. While some argue that it is pointless to try and keep them alive, I strongly disagree with this opinion. Traditional skills and lifestyles continue to play a vital role in modern society, contributing significantly to healthcare, environmental protection, and cultural heritage.On one hand, traditional skills and lifestyles offer valuable insights into ancient practices that can be utilized to tackle modern problems. For instance, many indigenous communities have developed unique medical practices that have been proven to be effective in treating various ailments. By studying and preserving these traditional practices, we can gain a deeper understanding of the medicinal properties of plants and develop new treatments for diseases. Furthermore, traditional farming practices have been shown to be more environmentally sustainable, promoting biodiversity and soil conservation.On the other hand, the protection of traditional skills and lifestyles is crucial for preserving cultural heritage. Many traditional practices are deeply rooted in a community's history and identity, and their loss would result in a significant cultural deficit. Moreover, the preservation of traditional skills and lifestyles provides a unique opportunity for cultural exchange and education. By learning about and appreciating traditional practices, we can foster greater cross-cultural understanding and respect.In conclusion, while technology has undoubtedly transformed modern society, it is essential to recognize the value of traditional skills and lifestyles. Rather than allowing them to die out, we should strive to preserve and promote them, recognizing their contributions to healthcare, environmental protection, and cultural heritage. By doing so, we can ensure that our rich cultural diversity is preserved for future generations and that we can continue to learn from and be inspired by the wisdom of the past.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;The debate surrounding whether to encourage a sense of competition or cooperation in children has been a longstanding one. While some people believe that fostering a competitive spirit in children is beneficial, others argue that teaching them to cooperate is more valuable. In this essay, we will discuss both views and provide our opinion on the matter.On the one hand, some people think that it is better to make children competitive than cooperative. They argue that a strong sense of competition helps children develop an urge to learn and practice, striving to be the best among their peers. This competitive spirit can drive them to achieve academic excellence, win sports competitions, and excel in extracurricular activities. Moreover, a competitive environment can prepare children for the real world, where they will face challenges and need to compete for resources, jobs, and recognition.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children to develop. By working together towards a common goal, children learn important skills such as communication, empathy, and problem-solving. In school activities and community projects, cooperation is crucial for achieving success. Furthermore, cooperation helps children develop social skills, build strong relationships, and understand the value of teamwork. It also teaches them to appreciate diversity, respect each other's opinions, and resolve conflicts peacefully.In conclusion, both competition and cooperation have their own arguments and benefits. While competition can drive children to achieve excellence, cooperation teaches them valuable social skills and prepares them for teamwork. As a student, I believe that a balance between both is necessary. Children should be encouraged to develop a competitive spirit, but also learn to cooperate and work together towards a common goal. By doing so, they will become well-rounded individuals, equipped with the skills and qualities necessary to succeed in all aspects of life.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;The impact of advertising on our society is a topic of debate among people. While some argue that advertising brings more harm than good, others refute this claim. In this essay, we will discuss both views and present my opinion on the matter.On the one hand, some people claim that the advantages of advertisement outweigh the harms to our lives. They argue that advertising informs consumers about new products and services, helps businesses to reach their target audience, and creates a sense of competition in the market, which can lead to better quality products and lower prices. Furthermore, it is undeniable that the advertising market gives lots of working opportunities to people, from producers and writers to models and cameramen.On the other hand, others argue that advertising has more negative effects on our society. For instance, it can create unrealistic expectations and promote materialism, leading to overspending and debt. Additionally, some advertisements can be misleading or deceptive, which can harm consumers. Others argue that advertising can also contribute to the erosion of traditional values and cultural norms.In recent years, online advertisement has become one of the easiest approaches for businesses to reach their target audience. Online advertisements have several potential gains, including cheaper costs, convenience, and the ability to easily observe the effectiveness of the advertisement. However, online advertising also raises concerns about privacy and the potential for cyberbullying.In my opinion, while advertising can have some negative effects, its benefits outweigh its harms. Advertising is a necessary part of a functioning market economy, and it provides many benefits to consumers and businesses alike. However, it is important for businesses and regulatory bodies to ensure that advertisements are truthful and do not promote harmful products or behaviors.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";The art world has long been plagued by a stark contrast between the financial fortunes of modern artists. While some creatives are lavished with exorbitant sums for their works, others struggle to make ends meet. This glaring disparity has sparked a contentious debate: should the government intervene to rectify this situation?On one hand, the current state of affairs is indeed unfair. A modern artist may receive a hefty paycheck for a single masterpiece, while laborers toil for years to earn a similar amount. This raises questions about the value we place on different types of work. It is arguable that the government should take steps to address this inequity, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their profession, are fairly compensated for their efforts.On the other hand, critics of government intervention argue that the art market is subject to the forces of supply and demand, and that the prices of artworks are determined by what buyers are willing to pay. They contend that government meddling would disrupt the natural market equilibrium and potentially stifle artistic innovation. Moreover, it is challenging for the government to determine the value of artistic creations, as it is often subjective and influenced by factors like cultural significance, originality, and aesthetic appeal.In conclusion, while the government may have a role to play in addressing the financial disparities within the art world, its intervention should be approached with caution. A balanced solution could involve initiatives that provide support for struggling artists, such as grants, subsidies, or affordable studio spaces, rather than direct market manipulation. By adopting a nuanced approach, the government can help mitigate the unfair situation without stifling the creative industry.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";"The notion that people should work longer hours has become a pervasive trend in today's fast-paced society. However, I strongly agree that working extended hours has a detrimental impact on individuals, their families, and society as a whole, and therefore, working hours should be restricted.Research has consistently shown that people who work long hours are more likely to experience adverse effects on their physical and mental health, as well as their personal lives. Prolonged working hours can lead to chronic fatigue, making individuals feel lethargic and apathetic, ultimately resulting in a lack of motivation to engage in physical exercise, a crucial aspect of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This sedentary lifestyle can exacerbate health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.Furthermore, working excessively long hours can lead to an unhealthy addiction to work, transforming individuals into ""workaholics."" This obsessive behavior can cause burnout, strain relationships with family and friends, and disrupt work-life balance. The consequences of this addiction can be far-reaching, affecting not only the individual but also their loved ones. Families may suffer from neglect, as parents or spouses devote excessive time to their jobs, leading to feelings of abandonment and resentment.Additionally, the societal implications of prolonged working hours are also noteworthy. Overworked employees are less productive, more prone to errors, and may experience decreased job satisfaction, ultimately affecting the overall quality of work. Moreover, the lack of leisure time can lead to a decline in community engagement, cultural participation, and social cohesion, which are essential for a healthy and thriving society.In conclusion, the negative effects of working long hours on individuals, families, and society are undeniable. Therefore, it is essential to restrict working hours to promote a better work-life balance, reduce health risks, and foster a more productive and harmonious society."
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;The idea that a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money is a widely held notion in today's society. However, I disagree with this perspective, as I believe that success encompasses a broader range of achievements beyond mere financial gain.In my opinion, a truly successful individual is one who has attained certain accomplishments in life, such as personal growth, meaningful relationships, and contributions to the community. These achievements are not necessarily measured by one's bank account, but rather by the positive impact they have on others and the sense of fulfillment they bring to the individual. For instance, a person who has dedicated their life to a noble cause, such as working for a non-profit organization or volunteering for a worthy charity, can be considered successful, regardless of their financial compensation.It is undeniable that money plays a significant role in our lives, providing us with the means to sustain ourselves and pursue our passions. However, the ways of earning it are diverse, and not all successful individuals have amassed wealth through lucrative careers or business ventures. Some may have achieved success through hard work, dedication, and passion in their chosen field, regardless of the financial rewards.Ultimately, a person's accomplishments are a direct result of their efforts, perseverance, and commitment to their goals. A successful person is one who has strived to achieve their aspirations, overcome obstacles, and remained true to their values. While financial success may be a byproduct of these efforts, it is not the sole defining factor of a person's success. Therefore, I firmly believe that success encompasses a broader range of achievements than just financial gain, and that a successful person is one who has attained personal fulfillment and made a positive impact on the world.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;The notion that high sales of popular consumer goods are driven by the power of advertising rather than real societal needs has been a topic of debate. While it is true that advertising plays a significant role in shaping consumer behavior, I only partially agree with this statement.In today's world, people's choice of consumption is heavily influenced by various forms of advertising, including those on television, streets, and magazines. Advertisers use persuasive techniques to create a perceived need for their products, often successfully convincing people to buy things they do not necessarily need. This can lead to a phenomenon where people prioritize material possessions over essential goods and services. For instance, the widespread desire for luxury brands and the latest gadgets can be attributed, in part, to the effective advertising strategies employed by these companies.However, it is essential to recognize that buying habits are highly personal and influenced by a multitude of factors, including individual needs and financial capabilities. While advertising can certainly sway people's purchasing decisions, it is not the sole determinant. Many people prioritize their spending based on their real needs, and advertising merely provides information to aid in their decision-making process. Furthermore, consumers are becoming increasingly discerning, with many individuals actively seeking out reviews, comparing products, and making informed choices that align with their values and requirements.In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly has a significant impact on consumer behavior, it is not the only driving force behind the high sales of popular consumer goods. Personal needs and consumption abilities also play a crucial role in shaping purchasing decisions. Therefore, I only partially agree with the statement, recognizing the influence of advertising while acknowledging the complexity of individual consumer behavior.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;The notion that paying taxes is enough contribution to society is a debatable topic. While paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfill apart from paying taxes.On the one hand, taxes play a vital role in supporting public goods and services that benefit society as a whole. The revenue generated from taxes is used to fund infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social welfare programs. In this sense, paying taxes is a necessary contribution to the well-being of society. However, I disagree with the idea that paying taxes is enough.There are impoverished or disabled people in every society who need help and support from others. These individuals often require assistance that goes beyond what the government can provide. Volunteering, donating to charity, and participating in community service are all essential ways that citizens can contribute to society. By engaging in these activities, citizens can make a tangible difference in the lives of those in need. Furthermore, active citizenship involves not only paying taxes but also participating in the democratic process, staying informed about local issues, and advocating for positive change.In conclusion, while paying taxes is an important responsibility of citizens, it is not enough to consider it the only contribution to society. Citizens have a range of responsibilities to fulfill, including volunteering, donating to charity, and participating in community service. By recognizing the value of these activities, we can work towards creating a more compassionate and engaged society.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";The idea that schools should focus solely on teaching academic subjects closely related to future careers, thereby relegating subjects like music and sports to secondary importance, is a notion that garnishes significant debate. Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects such as mathematics, physics, and engineering because these subjects are deemed necessary for securing well-paying jobs in the future. However, I strongly disagree with this perspective, as I believe there are many things far more important than merely having a job.Firstly, subjects like music and sports play a pivotal role in a child's holistic development. Music, for instance, enhances cognitive skills, memory, and spatial-temporal skills, all of which can indirectly benefit academic performance. Similarly, sports contribute to physical health, team building, and stress management - essential life skills that cannot be overlooked. By integrating these subjects into the curriculum, schools can foster well-rounded individuals equipped to handle the demands of life beyond their careers.Secondly, the value of education extends far beyond career preparation. Education is meant to enrich lives, foster curiosity, and create informed, empathetic members of society. Music and arts, in particular, offer perspectives and understanding of diverse cultures, histories, and human experiences, thereby broadening one's worldview. By sidelining these subjects, we risk producing a generation that, while professionally adept, lacks the depth and breadth of knowledge needed to navigate our complex world.Furthermore, many careers now value skills such as creativity, teamwork, and adaptability - skills that are often developed through extracurricular activities like music and sports. By dismissing these subjects, we may inadvertently disadvantage our students in their future professional pursuits.In conclusion, while academic subjects are undeniably crucial, it is misguided to believe that they are the sole purpose of education. Music, sports, and other often-overlooked subjects play vital roles in the development of well-rounded, informed, and happy individuals. Therefore, I strongly believe that schools should continue to value and teach a diverse range of subjects, ensuring that future generations are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and character needed to thrive in all aspects of life.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The advent of the internet has led to a significant shift in the way people consume information, with many believing that this will ultimately lead to the demise of traditional paper media, such as newspapers and magazines. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet-based media. However, many others still think they are going to stay. In my opinion, I agree with the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with time.The internet has made it possible for people to access a vast amount of information from anywhere in the world, at any time. This has led to a decline in the sales of newspapers and magazines, as people are no longer reliant on them for their daily dose of news and information. Moreover, online news websites and blogs have made it possible for people to stay updated on current events in real-time, making traditional paper media seem outdated and slow. Additionally, the environmental impact of paper media, such as deforestation and waste, has led many to opt for digital alternatives.Furthermore, the rise of social media has also contributed to the decline of traditional paper media. Many people now get their news and information from social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, rather than from newspapers and magazines. This shift in consumer behavior has forced many traditional paper media outlets to go online, in an attempt to stay relevant. However, this shift has also led to a decline in the quality of journalism, as online news outlets often prioritize clicks and shares over in-depth reporting and investigative journalism.In conclusion, while some people may still prefer traditional paper media, I believe that the internet has marked the beginning of the end for newspapers and magazines. As technology continues to advance and more people turn to the internet for their news and information, it is likely that traditional paper media will become a relic of the past.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;When it comes to choosing a job, many people prioritize salary as the most important consideration. While a decent salary is undeniably crucial for a comfortable life, I disagree that it is the only factor to consider. In many societies, the size of the salary offered often influences an individual's decision, but I firmly believe that other aspects play a significant role in determining one's overall job satisfaction and quality of life.Firstly, a job with friendly colleagues can greatly enhance one's work experience. A supportive and collaborative work environment fosters a sense of belonging, reducing stress and increasing motivation. A harmonious workplace culture can lead to stronger relationships, improved communication, and a more positive attitude towards work. Conversely, a toxic work environment can lead to burnout, anxiety, and a decrease in job satisfaction, regardless of the salary.Secondly, the physical and psychological environment of the workplace is equally important. A well-designed and well-maintained workspace can boost productivity, concentration, and overall well-being. Moreover, a safe and healthy work environment is essential for preventing work-related injuries and illnesses. A job that offers a healthy work-life balance, flexible working hours, and opportunities for growth and development can also contribute significantly to an individual's happiness and job satisfaction.In conclusion, while a decent salary is essential for a comfortable life, it is not the only consideration when choosing a job. Friendly colleagues, a positive work environment, and favorable work-place conditions can have a more profound impact on a person's happiness and quality of life. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these aspects when evaluating job opportunities, rather than solely focusing on the salary offered.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;Using a computer every day is a widespread phenomenon in today's world, where technology has become an essential part of everyday life. The impact of computers is evident globally, and children are no exception. However, I disagree with the notion that using a computer daily can have more negative than positive effects on children.On the contrary, I firmly believe that computers have a profoundly positive impact on children's lives, especially when used daily. One of the primary advantages of computers is the vast resources available on the internet. The internet provides children with an unparalleled wealth of information, educational resources, and learning tools. By using computers daily, children can tap into this vast repository of knowledge, which can significantly enhance their learning experience.The internet offers a wide range of educational websites, online libraries, and learning platforms that cater to different age groups and learning styles. These resources can help children develop their language skills, improve their understanding of complex concepts, and explore their interests in a more engaging and interactive way. Moreover, computers also provide children with opportunities to develop essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and digital literacy, which are crucial for their future success in an increasingly technology-driven world.Furthermore, computers also enable children to access online educational resources that may not be available in their local schools or communities. This can be particularly beneficial for children from disadvantaged backgrounds or those living in remote areas, where access to quality education may be limited.In conclusion, while there may be some negative effects associated with excessive computer use, I firmly believe that the benefits of using a computer daily far outweigh the drawbacks for children. By leveraging the vast resources available on the internet, computers can provide children with a wealth of knowledge, skills, and opportunities that can help them succeed in life.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;The notion that children from less affluent families are better prepared to tackle the problems of adult life has been a subject of debate. According to some people, a child who is brought up in a less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle the problems of adult life better than one from an affluent family. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are more prone to developing bad habits, such as crime, thievery, and thuggery. Growing up in an environment where financial struggles are a daily reality can often lead to desperation and a lack of opportunities, causing some individuals to turn to illicit activities. Moreover, these individuals will often not have access to good education, which is a crucial tool for preparing one for the challenges of adulthood. Without a proper education, they may lack the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate the complexities of adult life.On the other hand, children from wealthy families are more likely to have access to quality education, extracurricular activities, and resources that can help them develop important life skills. While it is true that some children from wealthy families may be sheltered from the harsh realities of life, many are also taught the value of hard work, discipline, and responsibility. These traits are essential for overcoming the obstacles that inevitably arise in adulthood.Furthermore, children from affluent families are more likely to have a support system in place, which can provide them with a safety net in times of need. This support system can be a crucial factor in helping them overcome the challenges of adult life.In conclusion, while it is possible for children from less affluent families to develop the skills and resilience necessary to tackle the problems of adult life, I firmly believe that children from wealthy families are better prepared. With access to quality education, resources, and a support system, they are more likely to have the tools necessary to navigate the complexities of adulthood.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;The notion that a sedentary lifestyle is the primary cause of many medical problems people face today has gained significant attention in recent years. Indeed, modern people are experiencing a multitude of health issues that were less prevalent in the past. Proponents of this view argue that the lack of physical activity is the main culprit behind these problems. However, I tend to disagree with this stance, as I believe that other factors play an even more significant role in contributing to these health concerns.While a sedentary lifestyle can certainly lead to various health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, it is not the sole cause of these problems. Other factors, such as a poor diet, stress, and environmental pollution, also play a substantial role in the development of these health issues. For instance, the widespread consumption of processed and high-calorie foods, which are often high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats, can lead to weight gain and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Similarly, chronic stress, which is often caused by work-related pressures and the fast pace of modern life, can also contribute to a range of health problems, including anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular disease.Moreover, environmental pollution, particularly air pollution, has been linked to a range of health issues, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even mental health concerns. In contrast, a sedentary lifestyle, while certainly a contributing factor, may not be the primary cause of these problems. Therefore, while it is true that a sedentary lifestyle can lead to various health issues, I believe that other factors, such as a poor diet, stress, and environmental pollution, have an even greater impact on our overall health.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";The debate on when foreign language instruction should begin has been a longstanding one, with some arguing that it should start in pre-school, while others contend that it should be introduced in later years. As for me, I firmly believe that kindergarten is the ideal time to start teaching children a secondary language.Firstly, research has shown that young children are more adept at learning languages than adults. Their brains are wired to absorb and process new sounds, grammar, and vocabulary more easily, making kindergarten an optimal time to introduce a foreign language. By starting early, children can develop a strong foundation in the language, which can be built upon in subsequent years.Moreover, learning a foreign language has been proven to have numerous cognitive benefits for children. It enhances their memory, concentration, and problem-solving skills, while also broadening their cultural understanding and appreciation. In today's increasingly globalized world, being proficient in multiple languages can also give children a competitive edge in their future careers.On the other hand, some may argue that introducing a foreign language too early can be overwhelming for young children, or that it may interfere with their native language development. However, I believe that with careful planning and implementation, these concerns can be mitigated. In fact, many kindergarten programs have successfully incorporated foreign language instruction into their curriculum, with positive results.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that kindergarten is the perfect time to start teaching children a secondary language. Not only does it take advantage of their natural ability to learn languages, but it also provides them with a valuable skill that will benefit them throughout their lives.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;International tourism has indeed boomed in the last few decades, transforming into a massive industry that generates substantial revenue for many countries around the world. However, some individuals argue that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh its benefits. While I acknowledge the drawbacks of mass tourism, I firmly believe that the advantages of international tourism far outweigh the disadvantages.On the one hand, it is true that the influx of tourists can lead to a range of problems, including environmental degradation, cultural homogenization, and strain on local resources. The sheer number of visitors can put pressure on local infrastructure, leading to issues such as overcrowding, pollution, and erosion of natural habitats. Additionally, the commercialization of tourism can result in the displacement of local communities and the loss of traditional ways of life.On the other hand, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of the local economy. Tourism creates jobs, stimulates economic growth, and generates revenue for local businesses, contributing to the overall well-being of the community. Furthermore, tourism can also promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange, fostering global citizenship and appreciation for diverse cultures.Moreover, many countries have implemented sustainable tourism practices, which aim to minimize the negative impacts of tourism while maximizing its benefits. These initiatives include eco-tourism, responsible travel, and community-based tourism, which prioritize environmental conservation, cultural preservation, and local community involvement.In conclusion, while international tourism does pose some problems, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. With careful planning, management, and implementation of sustainable tourism practices, the industry can continue to thrive while promoting cultural exchange, economic growth, and environmental conservation.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;The idea that children can learn more efficiently by watching TV has sparked a heated debate among parents, educators, and experts. While it is true that some children may benefit from watching educational programs, I firmly disagree with the notion that children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home.Watching TV is a very passive action, which can have a detrimental effect on children's cognitive and physical development. By spending more time watching TV, children are less likely to engage in active learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving activities. Moreover, excessive TV watching can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to a range of health problems, including obesity and decreased attention span.On the other hand, research has shown that children who participate in activities that foster creativity, cooperation, and competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. Engaging in hands-on activities, such as arts, crafts, sports, and group projects, can enhance children's cognitive skills, promote social skills, and build confidence. These activities also encourage children to think critically, solve problems, and develop essential life skills.In contrast, TV watching is a solitary activity that does not provide opportunities for social interaction, feedback, or self-expression. While educational programs may be informative, they lack the interactive and dynamic elements that are essential for children's holistic development.In conclusion, while TV can be a useful tool for learning, it should not be promoted as a primary means of education. Instead, schools and parents should encourage children to engage in a variety of activities that promote creativity, cooperation, and competition. By doing so, children can develop essential skills, build confidence, and achieve their full potential.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;The widespread use of the internet has enabled people to work or study from home, a trend that has sparked debate about its advantages and disadvantages. While some consider this arrangement to be beneficial, others reject it as detrimental to productivity and learning.On the one hand, working or studying from home offers numerous benefits. It saves time and energy that would be spent on commuting, allows for a flexible schedule, and provides a comfortable and distraction-free environment. Moreover, it enables people with disabilities or those living in remote areas to participate in the workforce or pursue education without facing significant barriers.On the other hand, some employers argue that working from home can be counterproductive. They claim that employees spend an inordinate amount of time communicating with colleagues via phone or email, which can hinder their deliverables and overall performance. Similarly, teachers believe that students who study from home may struggle to clarify doubts and questions in a timely manner, as they lack the instant feedback and guidance that a traditional classroom setting provides.Despite these drawbacks, I believe that the advantages of working or studying from home outweigh the disadvantages. With the right mindset and tools, individuals can stay focused and motivated while working remotely. Moreover, technology has made it easier for people to stay connected with colleagues and teachers, mitigating the negative effects of isolation.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the impact of working or studying from home, I believe that the benefits of flexibility, comfort, and accessibility make it a worthwhile arrangement for many people.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;The rapid growth of international tourism has transformed it into the largest industry worldwide, attracting millions of travelers every year. While some argue that it creates tension between people from different cultures, others believe it fosters understanding between nations. In my opinion, both perspectives hold some truth, and I will discuss the extent to which I agree with each viewpoint.On the one hand, international tourism can indeed lead to cultural clashes and misunderstandings. When people from diverse backgrounds interact, they may unintentionally offend each other due to differences in customs, norms, and values. For instance, a Western tourist's casual attitude towards dressing may be perceived as disrespectful in a conservative country. Such incidents can create tension and reinforce negative stereotypes. Moreover, the influx of tourists can also disrupt local traditions and ways of life, causing frustration among residents.On the other hand, international tourism can also bridge cultural gaps and promote understanding. When tourists and locals engage in open-minded dialogue, they can dispel misconceptions and gain insight into each other's perspectives. Many tourists make an effort to learn about the local culture, history, and customs, demonstrating respect and interest in the host country. Furthermore, tourism can also facilitate people-to-people diplomacy, where individuals from different nations build relationships, exchange ideas, and develop empathy.It is worth noting that even when conflicts or debates arise, they can ultimately lead to a deeper understanding between people from different cultures. When individuals engage in constructive discussions, they can clarify misunderstandings, challenge their own biases, and develop a more nuanced appreciation for each other's differences. In this sense, international tourism not only causes tension but also provides opportunities for growth, learning, and mutual understanding.In conclusion, while international tourism can lead to cultural clashes, it also has the potential to foster greater understanding and empathy between nations. By embracing the opportunities for cross-cultural exchange and dialogue, we can harness the power of tourism to build bridges between different cultures and promote global unity.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;The world of celebrity culture has always been a topic of fascination for young people. However, some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. I partially agree with this statement, as while some celebrities do prioritize their image over their craft, others use their platform to inspire and motivate young minds.On one hand, it is undeniable that many celebrities are more famous for their wealth and glamour than for their actual work. Their social media feeds are filled with pictures of their luxurious lifestyles, high-end fashion, and exotic vacations. This can create a false narrative that success is solely based on material possessions and physical appearance. Young people, who look up to these celebrities as role models, may feel pressure to prioritize superficial qualities over hard work and dedication. This can lead to a distorted view of what it takes to achieve success and can be detrimental to their self-esteem and motivation.On the other hand, there are many celebrities who use their platform to promote positive values and inspire young people to pursue their passions. For instance, celebrities like Malala Yousafzai and Leonardo DiCaprio are known for their philanthropic work and dedication to social and environmental causes. They show young people that success is not just about achieving fame and fortune, but also about making a positive impact on the world. These role models demonstrate that hard work, perseverance, and a commitment to one's values are essential to achieving success and making a difference.In conclusion, while it is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public, it is also true that many celebrities lead young people in the right direction. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to choose which celebrities to look up to and to remember that true success is not just about glamour and wealth, but about the positive impact one has on the world.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;The notion that children can effectively learn from watching television is a widely debated topic. While it is true that TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it, I disagree with the idea that they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school.On one hand, television can be a valuable tool for learning. Educational programs, documentaries, and children's shows can teach kids about various subjects such as science, history, and literature. TV can also help children develop important skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and language skills. Moreover, TV can expose children to different cultures, traditions, and ways of life, broadening their perspectives and understanding of the world.On the other hand, allowing students to watch TV at both school and home can have an adverse impact on their overall growth. Excessive TV watching can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity, eye problems, and other health issues. Moreover, TV can be a distraction from more important activities like reading, writing, and outdoor play, which are essential for a child's cognitive, emotional, and physical development.Furthermore, TV can also have a negative impact on children's social skills and behavior. Exposure to violent or inappropriate content can lead to aggression, fear, and anxiety in children. Additionally, TV can also create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism, materialism, and unhealthy values.In conclusion, while TV can be a useful tool for learning, it is crucial to maintain a balance between TV watching and other activities. Schools and parents should encourage children to watch educational TV programs, but also ensure that they engage in other activities that promote their overall growth and development. Limiting TV time and monitoring content is essential to ensure that children reap the benefits of TV without compromising their physical, emotional, and social well-being.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;The notion that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that younger workers are to be preferred is a contentious issue. While it is true that older workers may struggle to adapt to new concepts, it is unfair to generalize that they are less capable than their younger counterparts. However, there is some merit to the idea that older workers may be less responsive to change, and this can be attributed to their unchanged paradigm and preference for monotony and safe ideology.Older workers may have developed a fixed mindset and be more set in their ways, making it more challenging for them to adapt to new ideas and technologies. Their years of experience and familiarity with traditional methods can make them more resistant to change, and they may be less likely to take risks or embrace innovation. This rigidity can be a significant disadvantage in today's fast-paced and ever-evolving work environment.On the other hand, younger workers have grown up in a world of rapid technological advancements and are more likely to be open to new ideas and ways of thinking. They are also more likely to possess the latest knowledge and skills, which can give them an edge over older workers. Knowledge is a key factor that can help young workers outrank their older counterparts. Younger workers are often more proficient in the latest software, tools, and technologies, making them more valuable to employers.In conclusion, while it is not entirely fair to say that older workers are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas, there is some truth to the idea that they may be less adaptable than younger workers. However, this does not mean that older workers are not valuable assets to the workplace. Employers should recognize the strengths and weaknesses of workers of all ages and provide training and support to help older workers adapt to new ideas and technologies.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The increasing reliance on machines in our daily lives has sparked a debate about the impact of automation on human physical work. While some people argue that machines are detrimental to human health, others believe that they make work easier and more efficient. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and present my opinion on whether the advantages of machines outweigh the disadvantages.On one hand, some people think that the usage of machines is harmful to human health. With machines taking over physical tasks, humans are engaging in less physical activity, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. This can result in a range of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, the reduced physical activity can also lead to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Therefore, it is essential to consider the negative consequences of relying too heavily on machines.On the other hand, many people believe that using machines makes work easier and less time-consuming. Machines can perform tasks with greater speed and accuracy, freeing up human time and energy for more complex and creative tasks. For instance, machines can automate manufacturing processes, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing productivity. Additionally, machines can also assist in tasks that are difficult or impossible for humans to perform, such as space exploration or deep-sea diving. By leveraging machines, humans can focus on higher-level tasks that require creativity, problem-solving, and innovation.In my opinion, the advantages of machines outweigh the disadvantages. While it is essential to acknowledge the potential negative consequences of relying on machines, the benefits of increased productivity, efficiency, and innovation cannot be ignored. Moreover, with the advancement of technology, machines can be designed to promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles, such as fitness trackers and exercise machines. Ultimately, a balanced approach that incorporates both human physical activity and machine automation can lead to a healthier and more productive society.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;The notion that traditional skills and ways of life are doomed to die out with the advancement of technology is a widespread one. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. However, I totally disagree with this opinion.First and foremost, traditional skills and ways of life belong to the value of culture. They are the very fabric that makes each country unique and distinguishes it from others. The intricate craftsmanship, the vibrant art, and the rich folklore that are characteristic of a nation's heritage are what make it special. If we were to eliminate these traditional ways of life, we would be stripping our culture of its individuality and reducing it to a homogenous, technologically-driven entity.Consequently, people feel proud of their country and its rich cultural heritage, and this sense of pride is what motivates them to keep these conventions alive. In fact, many countries have made conscious efforts to preserve their traditional skills and ways of life, recognizing the value they bring to their cultural identity. For instance, Japan's dedication to preserving its ancient tea ceremonies, India's efforts to safeguard its intricate textile traditions, and Mexico's commitment to maintaining its vibrant folk music are all testaments to the importance of traditional skills and ways of life.Moreover, traditional skills and ways of life are not mutually exclusive with technological advancement. In fact, technology can be a powerful tool in preserving and promoting these traditional practices. For example, digital platforms can be used to showcase and teach traditional crafts, while social media can be leveraged to raise awareness about the importance of cultural heritage.In conclusion, while it is true that technological advancement can pose a threat to traditional skills and ways of life, it is by no means a guarantee of their demise. On the contrary, with careful preservation and promotion, these conventional ways of life can continue to thrive, enriching our cultural landscape and providing a sense of identity and belonging for generations to come.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;The rapid growth of urbanization has transformed big cities into melting pots, where people from diverse backgrounds converge to pursue opportunities. However, this phenomenon has also led to the problem of traffic overload, which has become a pressing concern for city planners. Overpopulation has resulted in an overwhelming number of vehicles on the road, leading to congestion, air pollution, and decreased quality of life. In this essay, I will argue that reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education, or shopping is not the only solution to alleviate traffic woes, but rather one of several strategies that can be employed.While it is true that reducing the need for travel can mitigate traffic congestion, it is not a feasible or realistic solution for many cities. For instance, some jobs require employees to be physically present, and online education cannot replace the social and interactive aspects of traditional learning. Moreover, shopping is often a sensory experience that cannot be replicated online. Therefore, city planners must explore alternative solutions to address traffic overload.One approach is to promote the use of non-personal vehicles, such as public transportation, cycling, and walking. By investing in efficient and reliable public transportation systems, cities can reduce the number of private vehicles on the road. Additionally, city planners can incentivize the use of bicycles and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, which not only reduces traffic but also promotes a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.Another strategy is to exploit the potential of suburb areas. By developing suburban areas into vibrant hubs of activity, complete with amenities and services, cities can reduce the need for people to travel to city centers. This approach can also help to decentralize population growth, reducing pressure on urban infrastructure.In conclusion, while reducing the need for travel is one way to alleviate traffic congestion, it is not the only solution. City planners must adopt a multi-faceted approach, incorporating non-personal vehicles, suburban development, and other strategies to address the complex issue of traffic overload. By doing so, cities can create more sustainable, livable, and efficient environments for their citizens.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;The lives of celebrities are often synonymous with glamour and wealth, making them household names. However, their fame is not solely based on their achievements, but rather on their public image and personal lives. This raises concerns about the impact of their influence on young people. In this essay, we will explore the extent to which it is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth.Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. They are constantly exposed to their lives, styles, and habits through various media platforms. As a result, many young individuals look up to these celebrities as role models, emulating their behavior and lifestyle choices. However, this can be detrimental to their health and personality development.On one hand, the health of young people can be negatively affected by following celebrities. For instance, celebrities often portray unattainable beauty standards, promoting unhealthy dieting habits and unrealistic body shapes. This can lead to body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and eating disorders among young people. Moreover, celebrities' lavish lifestyles and substance abuse can also encourage young people to engage in similar behaviors, putting their physical and mental health at risk.On the other hand, the personality of young people can also be influenced by celebrities. The constant exposure to their luxurious lives and fame can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of entitlement among young people. This can lead to a lack of empathy, narcissism, and a distorted view of reality. Furthermore, the constant need for validation and attention on social media, as seen in celebrities' lives, can also promote self-centeredness and a decrease in face-to-face communication skills.In conclusion, it is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. The constant exposure to their lives and habits can negatively impact young people's health and personality development. It is essential for parents, educators, and media platforms to promote positive role models and realistic expectations, ensuring that young people are not misled by the glamour and wealth of celebrities.
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;The issue of gender equality in university admissions has been a topic of discussion for many years. In recent times, many institutions have taken steps to address this issue by accepting an equal number of male and female students in various courses. I agree to a great extent that universities should strive to achieve a balanced gender ratio in every subject.One of the primary reasons for this is to ensure equal opportunities for both men and women to develop their skills and pursue their careers. Gender issues have been a long-standing concern, and realizing an equal proportion of developing human resources is crucial for a balanced society. By accepting equal numbers of male and female students, universities can play a significant role in bridging the gender gap and promoting equality.In recent years, there has been a noticeable rise in the proportion of women enrolling in various courses across many parts of the world. This trend is encouraging, and universities should continue to build on this momentum. By maintaining a balanced gender ratio, universities can create a diverse and inclusive learning environment that fosters collaboration, creativity, and innovation.However, it is also important to note that some subjects may have inherent gender imbalances due to various social and cultural factors. For instance, certain fields like engineering and technology have traditionally been male-dominated, while fields like nursing and education have been female-dominated. In such cases, universities may need to adopt flexible admission policies to address these imbalances.In conclusion, I strongly believe that universities should strive to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. This approach can help promote gender equality, create a diverse learning environment, and provide equal opportunities for all students to develop their skills and pursue their careers.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;The hazards of smoking have been well-documented, and it is undeniable that it is a lethal habit that claims millions of lives worldwide every year. In light of this, many countries have taken the bold step of banning smoking in all public places, except in designated areas. This essay argues in favor of implementing such rules in all countries, citing the risks posed by smoking to both smokers and non-smokers alike.People around the world have come to recognize smoking as a shameful practice that is not only detrimental to one's own health but also to those around them. The dangers of second-hand smoke, also known as passive smoking, cannot be overstated. Those who are exposed to second-hand smoke are at risk of developing serious health problems, including respiratory diseases and cancer. This is especially concerning in public places such as bus and railway stations, where people are often in close proximity to one another.By prohibiting smoking in these areas, governments can significantly reduce the risks associated with second-hand smoke. Moreover, such a ban can also help to reduce the social acceptability of smoking, which is a crucial step in discouraging people from taking up the habit in the first place. Many countries have already seen a significant decline in smoking rates since implementing such bans, and it is likely that others would experience similar results.In conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the argument that smoking should be prohibited in public places. It is a matter of protecting the health and wellbeing of citizens, and it is the responsibility of governments to take proactive steps to prevent unnecessary harm. Therefore, all countries should follow the lead of those that have already implemented such bans and make smoking in public places a thing of the past.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;The assertion that tourism is a modern form of colonialism is a contentious issue, with valid arguments on both sides. On one hand, some people believe that tourism is a contributing factor to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation, and irreparable damage to the exploited places. This perspective is substantiated by the fact that the influx of tourists can lead to inflation, displacement of local communities, and degradation of natural habitats.However, in my opinion, the statement is too sweeping and does not account for the benefits that tourism can bring when managed responsibly. I strongly believe that a combination of tourism and teaching process can foster a harmonial relationship between humans and their surroundings. By educating tourists about the local culture, environment, and history, tourism can become a tool for promoting cross-cultural understanding, environmental conservation, and sustainable development.In fact, many countries have successfully harnessed tourism as a means to preserve their cultural heritage and natural resources. For instance, ecotourism initiatives have been instrumental in protecting biodiversity and supporting local conservation efforts. Moreover, tourism can generate income and create employment opportunities for local communities, thereby contributing to their economic empowerment.Rather than rejecting tourism outright, we should focus on promoting sustainable tourism practices that prioritize the well-being of local communities and the environment. This can be achieved through measures such as implementing eco-friendly policies, supporting local businesses, and educating tourists about responsible travel behaviors.In conclusion, while tourism can have negative consequences if not managed properly, I do not entirely support the idea that it is a modern form of colonialism. Instead, I believe that tourism can be a powerful tool for promoting cultural exchange, environmental conservation, and sustainable development when combined with education and responsible practices.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;The rapid evolution of Information Technology (IT) over the past 20 years has undoubtedly transformed the way we live and work. The advent of the World Wide Web and email communication has revolutionized the way we access information, connect with others, and conduct business. These developments have significantly improved our standard of living and work efficiency, enabling us to access vast amounts of information, collaborate with others globally, and automate various tasks.However, despite these numerous benefits, there is a growing concern that future developments in IT may have more negative effects than positive. I tend to agree with this view, as the rapid pace of IT development seems to be having a detrimental impact on our lives. With the constant stream of information and the pressure to stay connected, IT appears to be turning its users into its slaves. People are becoming increasingly dependent on technology, spending excessive amounts of time staring at screens, and losing touch with the physical world.Moreover, the rise of social media and the internet has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication skills, deepened social isolation, and increased the spread of misinformation. The constant notifications, emails, and messages can be overwhelming, leading to stress, anxiety, and decreased productivity. Furthermore, the collection and misuse of personal data by IT companies have raised concerns about privacy and security.In conclusion, while IT has undoubtedly brought numerous benefits, its rapid evolution is also having negative consequences. As we move forward, it is crucial that we acknowledge these drawbacks and strive to find a balance between harnessing the power of IT and maintaining a healthy, balanced lifestyle. By doing so, we can ensure that IT continues to improve our lives without controlling them.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;The adoption of a vegetarian diet has gained significant momentum in recent years, with a rapid increase in the number of people embracing this lifestyle. While some may attribute this trend to concerns about animal rights, it is clear that there are other compelling reasons driving this shift. In my opinion, the primary motivations behind the growing popularity of vegetarianism lie in its perceived health benefits and religious affiliations.On the one hand, health improvement is a major factor contributing to the widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet. A plant-based diet has been consistently shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. With the rising awareness of the importance of healthy eating, many individuals are turning to vegetarianism as a means of improving their overall wellbeing. The emphasis on consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has resonated with people seeking to enhance their physical health.On the other hand, religious beliefs also play a significant role in the decision to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle. In many Eastern cultures, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, a plant-based diet is deeply rooted in spiritual and philosophical beliefs. The principle of non-violence and compassion towards all living beings is a core tenet of these faiths, leading many adherents to adopt a vegetarian diet as a way of life. Furthermore, some Christian denominations also promote vegetarianism as a means of spiritual purification and self-discipline.In conclusion, while animal rights issues may be a factor in some individuals' decision to adopt a vegetarian diet, it is clear that health improvement and religious beliefs are significant contributors to the growing popularity of vegetarianism. As people become increasingly aware of the benefits of a plant-based diet, it is likely that this trend will continue to gain momentum in the years to come.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;The rapid advancement of technology in various countries has sparked a heated debate about the fate of traditional skills and ways of life. Some argue that it is futile to attempt to preserve these customs, as they inevitably succumb to the onslaught of modernization. While it is undeniable that technological progress often ushers in novel skills and lifestyles, I firmly believe that traditional skills and ways of life can adapt and evolve, rather than disappear entirely.There is no doubt that the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied by modern skills and new lifestyles. The rise of automation, artificial intelligence, and digital communication has undoubtedly transformed the way people live, work, and interact. However, from my point of view, what can be expected is a change of the role of tradition, but not its disappearance from society. Traditional skills and ways of life can be repurposed to coexist with modern advancements, rather than being mutually exclusive.For instance, traditional craftsmanship can be adapted to incorporate modern materials and techniques, breathing new life into age-old practices. Similarly, cultural festivals and celebrations can be reimagined to incorporate contemporary themes and technologies, ensuring their continued relevance and appeal. Furthermore, the preservation of traditional skills and ways of life can also serve as a vital link to a country's cultural heritage, fostering a sense of identity and community.In conclusion, while technological advancements will undoubtedly reshape traditional skills and ways of life, I firmly believe that it is possible to preserve and adapt these customs in a way that is compatible with modernization. By embracing innovation and evolution, traditional skills and ways of life can continue to thrive, enriching our lives and connecting us to our cultural past.
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;I disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. On the contrary, I firmly believe that zoos play a vital role in education, research, and conservation, making them an indispensable institution in our society.One of the primary functions of a zoo is to serve as a means of education, providing learners with real and vivid materials to enhance their understanding of the natural world. By visiting a zoo, students can observe and interact with various animal species, gaining hands-on experience and a deeper appreciation for the diversity of life on our planet. This is particularly beneficial for young learners, as it helps to foster a sense of wonder, curiosity, and responsibility towards the environment.At a higher level, zoos offer university students a unique opportunity to conduct biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings. By studying animals in a controlled environment, researchers can gather valuable data and insights that would be difficult or impossible to obtain in the wild. This has led to numerous groundbreaking discoveries and a better understanding of animal behavior, physiology, and ecology.Furthermore, the process of globalization has led to the encroachment upon natural habitats, resulting in the destruction of ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity. In this context, zoos can serve as a safe haven for endangered species, providing a secure environment for breeding programs and conservation efforts. By supporting these initiatives, zoos can contribute to the preservation of species and the protection of ecosystems, ultimately helping to mitigate the negative impacts of globalization.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. On the contrary, zoos play a vital role in education, research, and conservation, making them an essential institution in our society. By providing a platform for learning, research, and conservation, zoos can inspire future generations to appreciate, respect, and protect the natural world.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";The debate surrounding the preservation of minority languages has sparked intense discussion, with some arguing that governments should allocate public funds to save these languages, while others claim that such efforts would be a waste of resources. In this essay, we will delve into both perspectives and ultimately present a case for why governments should prioritize the preservation of minority languages.On one hand, those who oppose government intervention argue that the cost of preserving minority languages outweighs the benefits. They claim that with the increasing globalization and dominance of widely-spoken languages, it is more practical to focus on languages that have a broader reach and utility. Furthermore, they argue that the limited number of speakers and the relatively small impact of these languages on the global stage render them less worthy of investment.On the other hand, proponents of government involvement contend that minority languages are an integral part of the world's cultural diversity and heritage. They argue that these languages possess unique characteristics, histories, and cultural contexts that are worth preserving for future generations. Moreover, they emphasize that language preservation is not solely about practicality, but also about respecting the identity and traditions of the communities that speak them.Despite the above arguments, I still strongly believe that governments should try to preserve minority languages. The formation of a language is a gradual process that unfolds over thousands of years, shaping the collective identity and experiences of its speakers. As such, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Language is one of the essential factors that create the differences and unique cultures that enrich our world. By preserving minority languages, we are not only safeguarding the cultural heritage of the communities that speak them but also contributing to the rich tapestry of human expression and understanding. Therefore, governments should prioritize the preservation of minority languages, recognizing their inherent value and the significant role they play in shaping the diverse cultural landscape of our world.
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";"The allocation of a country's health budget is a crucial decision that can significantly impact the overall well-being of its citizens. The statement suggests that a large proportion of the health budget should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. I agree with this statement to a great extent.The age-old saying in medicine, ""prevention is better than cure,"" holds true in this context. Investing in health education and preventative measures can help prevent the onset of various diseases, reducing the need for costly treatments. By allocating a larger proportion of the health budget towards prevention, a country can significantly reduce its healthcare expenditure in the long run. It will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, which are often caused by lifestyle choices and can be prevented through education and awareness.Moreover, health education should start from a young age. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food, as well as harmful food, to instill healthy eating habits from an early age. This can help prevent childhood obesity and related health problems, which can have long-term consequences on their health and well-being. Furthermore, health education can also focus on other important areas such as mental health, stress management, and disease prevention, enabling individuals to take control of their health and make informed decisions.While treatment is essential for those who are already ill, diverting a large proportion of the health budget towards prevention can have far-reaching benefits for the country as a whole. It can lead to a healthier population, reduced healthcare costs, and a more productive workforce. Therefore, I strongly agree that a significant proportion of a country’s health budget should be allocated towards health education and preventative measures."
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The notion that university education should be restricted to the very best academic students has been a topic of debate in recent years. While some argue that this approach would ensure that only the most intellectually gifted individuals have access to higher education, others contend that it would be counterproductive and unfair. In my opinion, I disagree with the idea of restricting university education to only the best academic students.On one hand, it is undeniable that outstanding academic students have an intellectual advantage that would enable them to excel in a university setting. They would be able to take full advantage of the academic resources and opportunities available, and their presence would likely elevate the overall academic standards of the institution. However, this narrow focus on academic excellence overlooks the fact that university is not just about academic studies. It is also a place where students can nurture their artistic talents, develop their soft skills, and explore their passions.By restricting university education to only the best academic students, we would be depriving many young people of the opportunity to develop these important skills and pursue their interests. University is a place where students can discover their strengths and weaknesses, learn from their failures, and develop important life skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. Furthermore, many successful individuals have achieved greatness not solely due to their academic prowess, but also due to their creativity, innovative thinking, and ability to work well with others.In conclusion, the idea of restricting university education to only the best academic students has both pros and cons. While it may ensure that only the most intellectually gifted individuals have access to higher education, it would also deprive many young people of the opportunity to develop important skills and pursue their passions. Ultimately, I believe that university education should be accessible to a large proportion of young people, as it provides a unique opportunity for personal growth, development, and exploration.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;"I disagree with the statement ""Parents are the best teachers."" While parents play a significant role in a child's development, I believe that teachers are better equipped to provide a well-rounded education in some aspects. Children grow up with two important people in their lives, their parents and teachers, who shape their knowledge, values, and behaviors.On one hand, parents are the first point of contact for children, providing them with basic life skills, moral values, and emotional support. They are responsible for instilling good habits, discipline, and a sense of responsibility in their children. However, when it comes to formal education, I think teachers have an edge over parents. Teachers are trained professionals with specialized knowledge in specific subjects, which enables them to provide in-depth information and guidance to children.In a classroom setting, teachers can cater to the needs of multiple students, using various teaching methods and techniques to engage and motivate them. They can also provide a structured learning environment, which is essential for children to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills. Furthermore, teachers can offer a broader perspective on various subjects, exposing children to different viewpoints and ideas, which is crucial for their intellectual and emotional growth.In contrast, parents, no matter how well-intentioned, may not have the expertise or resources to provide a comprehensive education. They may also be biased in their teaching, unintentionally passing on their own prejudices and limited experiences to their children. Additionally, parents may not have the patience, time, or energy to devote to their child's education, especially if they have other responsibilities and commitments.In conclusion, while parents play a vital role in a child's upbringing, I believe that teachers are better suited to provide a well-rounded education in some aspects. Their specialized knowledge, training, and experience make them more effective in imparting knowledge, skills, and values to children."
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;When choosing a job, the notion that salary is the most important consideration has gained significant traction in recent years. In fact, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers for everyone. However, I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects that should be seen as important as income when people choose a job.On one hand, I agree that money is very essential in order to meet human basic needs. A decent salary enables individuals to afford the necessities of life, such as food, shelter, and healthcare, which are fundamental to human survival. Furthermore, a good salary can provide a sense of financial security, which is crucial for overall well-being and happiness. It is understandable that many people prioritize salary when selecting a job, as it can directly impact their quality of life.On the other hand, I firmly believe that there are other factors that should be considered equally important as income when choosing a job. For instance, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and personal growth opportunities are essential aspects that can significantly impact an individual's happiness and fulfillment. A job that offers a sense of purpose, autonomy, and opportunities for skill development can lead to a more meaningful and satisfying career, even if the salary is not the highest. Moreover, a job that aligns with one's values and passions can bring a sense of joy and motivation, which can be just as valuable as a high salary.In conclusion, while salary is undoubtedly a crucial consideration when choosing a job, I disagree that it is the most important consideration. Other aspects, such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and personal growth opportunities, should also be given significant weight. By considering these factors equally, individuals can make more informed decisions that lead to a more fulfilling and satisfying career.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;The burning of oil for transportation, particularly in private cars, is indeed a wasteful and environmentally irresponsible practice. The proposition to increase taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to very high levels as a means to discourage the use of private cars warrants consideration, but it also raises concerns about its broader implications.On one hand, it is undeniable that the excessive consumption of oil for private transportation has exerted severe pressure on both the environment and the economy. The combustion of fossil fuels is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, with severe consequences for climate change, public health, and ecosystem degradation. Furthermore, the economic burden of oil consumption is significant, with many countries struggling to balance their trade deficits due to costly oil imports. Increasing taxation on petrol and diesel could effectively reduce the demand for these fuels, thereby mitigating some of these issues.On the other hand, there are potential downsides to this approach. One significant concern is that higher fuel prices would inevitably lead to increased costs for transporting goods, including essential products such as rice, meat, and vegetables. This could have a disproportionate impact on low-income households, which already spend a larger fraction of their income on basic necessities. Consequently, the policy might exacerbate economic inequality.Additionally, countries that import oil would likely become even more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially, as they would be forced to negotiate for more favorable terms or seek alternative, potentially more expensive, energy sources. This could undermine their energy security and sovereignty.In conclusion, while increasing taxation on petrol and diesel to discourage private car use has environmental and economic merits, its implementation needs to be carefully considered to mitigate the potential negative impacts on the cost of living and national dependencies. A balanced approach might involve investing the tax revenues in public transportation and renewable energy infrastructure to offer viable alternatives to private car ownership.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;The debate over whether arming police forces contributes to higher levels of violence in society has been a contentious issue in recent years. While some argue that carrying guns by police is necessary for their protection and to maintain law and order, others believe that it perpetuates a cycle of violence. I agree with the latter opinion to a significant extent.On one hand, the increasing number of street criminals has led to the justification of police carrying guns as a necessary measure for self-protection. However, this trend has sparked concerns among many, who assume that it reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. One of the primary reasons for this concern is that the presence of guns can escalate situations, leading to the use of deadly force. When police officers are armed, they may be more likely to resort to shooting in tense situations, which can result in unnecessary loss of life and further fuel violence.Furthermore, the visibility of guns in the hands of police officers can also contribute to a culture of fear and intimidation, particularly in communities that have historically been marginalized or oppressed. This can lead to a breakdown in trust between law enforcement and the public, creating an environment in which violence is more likely to thrive. In addition, the normalization of guns in police forces can also set a dangerous precedent, where the use of firearms becomes a standard response to conflicts, rather than a last resort.In conclusion, while the argument for arming police forces is rooted in concerns for officer safety, I firmly believe that this trend contributes to a higher level of violence in society. By perpetuating a culture of fear and intimidation, and escalating situations through the use of deadly force, the presence of guns in police forces can create a vicious cycle of violence that is difficult to break.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;"The integration of technology in education has revolutionized the way students learn and acquire knowledge. The statement ""With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly"" resonates with me, and I strongly agree with it. In my opinion, the richness and convenience of technology are the two primary factors that contribute to the students' progress.Firstly, technology provides students with an unparalleled wealth of information at their fingertips. The internet, online libraries, and educational websites have made it possible for students to access a vast array of learning materials, including e-books, articles, and videos. This abundance of resources enables students to explore topics in-depth, broaden their knowledge, and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in their field of study. For instance, online platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera offer free courses and tutorials on various subjects, allowing students to learn at their own pace and convenience.Secondly, technology has made learning more convenient and efficient. With the help of digital tools, students can organize their study materials, set reminders, and track their progress. Mobile apps like Evernote and Quizlet enable students to take notes, create flashcards, and practice quizzes on-the-go. Moreover, online collaboration tools like Google Docs and Slack facilitate group work, discussion, and feedback, promoting teamwork and communication skills. These technological advancements have significantly reduced the time and effort required to complete assignments, allowing students to focus on the learning process itself.In conclusion, I firmly believe that technology has transformed the learning landscape, enabling students to acquire more information and learn it more quickly. The richness and convenience of technology have empowered students to take charge of their learning, explore new subjects, and develop essential skills for the digital age. As technology continues to evolve, I am confident that its role in education will only become more prominent, leading to better scholastic performances and a more informed, tech-savvy generation."
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;The last hundred years have witnessed tremendous technological advancements, revolutionizing various aspects of human life. While some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives, I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.On the one hand, it is undeniable that technological progress has some negative consequences. For instance, the over-reliance on technology has led to decreased face-to-face communication skills among people, resulting in social isolation. Moreover, the excessive use of digital devices has been linked to various health problems, including obesity, sleep disorders, and eye strain. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological change has created a culture of disposability, contributing to environmental degradation and waste.On the other hand, I firmly believe that the benefits of technological progress far outweigh its drawbacks. Technology has improved healthcare outcomes, enabled instant global communication, and increased access to information. It has also created numerous job opportunities, transformed the way we learn, and made many tasks more efficient. For example, telemedicine has expanded healthcare access to remote areas, while online education has made learning more flexible and convenient. Additionally, technological advancements have enabled people to work remotely, promoting a better work-life balance.In conclusion, while acknowledging the negative effects of technological progress, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. Rather than viewing technology as a hindrance, we should focus on harnessing its potential to improve our lives. By being aware of the potential drawbacks and taking steps to mitigate them, we can maximize the advantages of technological progress and create a better future for all.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";The proliferation of violence in television programs has become a pressing concern in recent years. As the impact of television on our daily lives continues to grow, it is imperative that we reassess the content being broadcasted. In my opinion, it is crucial that we reduce the amount of violence in television programs, particularly those targeted at children.Governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children's television programs in order to tackle this problem more effectively. Children are highly impressionable, and exposing them to violent content can have long-lasting effects on their mental and emotional well-being. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, and may emulate the violent behaviors they witness on television. This can lead to an increase in aggressive behavior, desensitization to violence, and a lack of empathy towards others.However, implementing a blanket ban on violent content in all television programs may not be the most effective solution. It would be a violation of adults' civil liberties if governments implement such a restricted regulation on TV shows or movies that are intended for mature audiences only. Adults have the capacity to distinguish between fiction and reality, and should be able to choose what they watch. Moreover, some TV shows and movies may depict violence in a way that is thought-provoking and raises important social issues.Therefore, a more nuanced approach is needed. Governments should focus on regulating children's television programs, while allowing adults to make informed choices about what they watch. Additionally, television networks and producers should take responsibility for creating content that promotes positive values and respectful behavior. By working together, we can reduce the amount of violence in television programs and create a more positive viewing experience for audiences of all ages.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The debate on whether arming police forces contributes to higher levels of violence in society has been ongoing for quite some time. Some argue that equipping police with guns leads to an escalation of violence, while others believe this is a necessary measure for maintaining law and order. In my opinion, the relationship between armed police forces and societal violence is more complex than a straightforward cause-and-effect scenario.It is true that the number of criminal incidents is increasing rapidly worldwide. Some inhabitants argue that this surge in crime rates is directly related to the use of guns by police to resolve criminal situations. However, I tend to disagree with this statement. While it is possible that the presence of guns in policing can lead to an increased risk of violence in certain situations, I believe that other factors contribute significantly to the incline in violence levels.One such factor is the socioeconomic conditions prevalent in a society. Poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to education can all contribute to higher crime rates and violence. Moreover, the media's portrayal of violence and the glorification of crime in popular culture can also have a desensitizing effect on individuals, potentially leading to an increase in violent behavior.Furthermore, the training and protocols in place for police officers also play a significant role in determining the likelihood of violence in policing situations. When officers are adequately trained in de-escalation techniques and follow strict protocols for the use of firearms, the risk of unnecessary violence is significantly reduced.In conclusion, while the use of guns by police may contribute to a slight increase in the level of violence in certain situations, it is not the primary factor driving the rise in criminality. Rather, it is the complex interplay of various socioeconomic, cultural, and policing factors that together shape the level of violence in a society.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";The statement that classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school is a topic of ongoing debate. While some may argue that parents have the most significant impact, I firmly believe that classmates play a more crucial role in shaping a child's academic success.Firstly, classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements. The reason is that children spend a significant amount of time with their peers in school, engaging in various academic and extracurricular activities. This prolonged exposure to classmates creates a unique environment that fosters a sense of belonging, motivation, and competition. As a result, classmates have a profound impact on a child's academic performance, as they are constantly influenced by their peers' values, attitudes, and work habits.Moreover, classmates create a competitive atmosphere that incents children to perform better. When children are surrounded by their peers, they naturally feel the need to keep up with their peers' academic achievements. This sense of competition drives them to work harder, strive for excellence, and push beyond their limits. For instance, a child who is surrounded by classmates who are high achievers is more likely to be motivated to study harder and perform better, simply because they do not want to be left behind.From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exerts enormous pressure on the children's academic performances. Children are highly susceptible to peer pressure, and the fear of being ostracized or ridiculed by their peers can be a powerful motivator. For example, a child who is struggling in a particular subject may feel compelled to seek help and improve their grades simply because they do not want to be perceived as weak or incompetent by their peers.In conclusion, while parents undoubtedly play a significant role in a child's academic success, I firmly believe that classmates are a more important influence. The competitive atmosphere, sense of belonging, and peer pressure that classmates create have a profound impact on a child's academic performance. As such, classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements, and their role in shaping a child's academic success should not be underestimated.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. While life in those cities is good in some ways, such as access to various job opportunities and modern facilities, people's health would therefore be affected negatively. I strongly agree with the opinion that living in big cities is bad for people's health.One of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before is environmental pollution. The high levels of air, water, and noise pollution in cities have severe impacts on both physical and mental health. For instance, research has shown that people living in cities with high levels of air pollution are more likely to develop respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, the stress of living in a crowded and noisy environment can lead to anxiety and depression, which can have long-term effects on mental health.Another reason why city living is detrimental to health is the lack of green spaces and the sedentary lifestyle that often comes with it. Unlike rural areas, cities often have limited green spaces, making it difficult for people to engage in outdoor activities and sports. Additionally, the availability of fast food and the lack of time for physical activity due to busy work schedules contribute to unhealthy eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle, leading to obesity and other diet-related health problems.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;The notion that arming police officers leads to increased violence in society has sparked a contentious debate. While some individuals believe that carrying guns encourages higher levels of violence, I disagree with this stance to a significant extent.On one hand, some people may argue that allowing policemen to carry firearms can increase violence in society. They may contend that the presence of guns can escalate confrontations and lead to more violent outcomes. However, this argument oversimplifies the issue. Most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally, rather than those wielded by law enforcement. The root cause of violence is not the guns themselves, but rather the individuals who misuse them.In reality, the crux of the problem lies in the actions of the people, not the tools they use. If a government truly wants to control crime in a community, it is crucial to manage the actions of its people rather than the guns used in violent crimes. This involves addressing underlying social issues, such as poverty, lack of education, and unemployment, which often drive individuals to commit crimes. By tackling these root causes, governments can reduce the likelihood of violent crimes, regardless of whether police officers carry guns or not.Furthermore, arming police officers can actually help to prevent violent crimes. When law enforcement is equipped with the necessary tools to respond to threats, they can more effectively protect the community and deter potential offenders. In many cases, the presence of armed police officers has helped to resolve situations peacefully, without the need for shots to be fired.In conclusion, while some may argue that arming police officers leads to increased violence, I firmly believe that this argument is unfounded. By addressing the root causes of violence and providing police officers with the necessary tools to respond to threats, governments can create a safer, more secure society for all.
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;The assertion that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country is a widely debated topic. While some argue that other factors such as economic growth, infrastructure development, and technological advancements play a more significant role, I firmly believe that education is indeed the most crucial element in a country's development.In a developing country, the harsh reality is that not many can afford to send their children to school. However, this should not undermine the significance of education in these nations. In fact, it is in these countries that education can have the most profound impact. Education has the power to break the cycle of poverty and inequality, empowering individuals to make informed decisions that can improve their socio-economic status.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers, or engineers. Rather, it is about cultivating a well-informed and enlightened citizenry. A well-informed individual can act sensibly and make sound judgments, which is essential for a country's progress. Education enables people to think critically, solve problems, and innovate, leading to a more productive and efficient workforce.Furthermore, education has a ripple effect, impacting not only the individual but also their community and the country at large. Educated individuals are more likely to participate in the democratic process, contribute to the economy, and engage in civic activities, all of which are vital for a country's development. In conclusion, while other factors are important, education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. It has the power to transform individuals, communities, and nations, leading to a brighter and more prosperous future. Therefore, it is essential that governments and organizations prioritize education, making it accessible and affordable for all, especially in developing countries.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";The influence of celebrities on young people has been a topic of discussion for many years. Some people argue that nowadays, celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. I partially agree with this statement, as I believe that the impact of celebrities on adolescents is not entirely negative.On one hand, it is true that some people become famous not because of their talents or achievements, but due to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. These individuals may promote a materialistic and superficial lifestyle that can have a negative influence on young people. Adolescents may start to value wealth and fame over hard work and genuine accomplishments, which can lead to a distorted perception of what is truly important in life.On the other hand, I believe that the young generation these days is very conscious towards positive lifestyles. Many young people are aware of the importance of hard work, education, and personal development, and are not easily swayed by the superficial allure of celebrity culture. Moreover, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well-equipped with life skills and critical thinking. With the rise of social media, young people have access to a vast amount of information and are able to make informed decisions about what they want to achieve in life.Additionally, it is worth noting that not many people can exist in the celebrity world without any talents or achievements. While some may become famous due to their wealth or lifestyle, many others have worked hard to develop their talents and achieve success in their field. These individuals can serve as positive role models, inspiring young people to pursue their passions and work towards their goals.In conclusion, while I agree that some celebrities may set a bad example for young people, I do not think that this is a universal truth. Many young people are aware of the importance of positive values and are not easily influenced by superficial celebrity culture. Furthermore, there are many celebrities who are talented and hardworking, and can serve as positive role models for young people.
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way people communicate, and its widespread use has been a defining feature of the 21st century. With people of all ages utilizing these devices, it is undeniable that mobile phones have become an integral part of our daily lives. However, I firmly believe that this great invention has a darker side, causing numerous problems in our society.One of the most significant issues associated with excessive mobile phone use is its adverse effect on our social skills. Spending too much time on mobile phones can lead to social isolation, as individuals substitute face-to-face interactions with virtual communication. This can result in a decline in empathy, deep thinking, and problem-solving skills, all of which are essential for building and maintaining meaningful relationships. Moreover, the constant distraction of notifications and social media updates can lead to a decrease in attention span, making it challenging for people to engage in profound conversations.Furthermore, the over-reliance on mobile phones can also lead to a decline in community involvement and social cohesion. People are more likely to spend their free time scrolling through their feeds rather than engaging in community activities, volunteering, or participating in group sports. This can lead to a breakdown in social bonds and a sense of disconnection from the community.In conclusion, while mobile phones have undoubtedly made communication more convenient and accessible, I believe that the negative consequences of excessive mobile phone use far outweigh the benefits. It is essential for individuals to be aware of these risks and establish a balance between mobile phone use and face-to-face interaction to maintain healthy social skills and a strong sense of community.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;The notion that government and large companies should solely be responsible for reducing environmental damage has been a topic of discussion among environmentalists. While it is true that some environmental problems require vast resources and advanced technology, making it seem like a task only governments and large corporations can undertake, I disagree that ordinary people have little to contribute to environmental improvement.On one hand, it is undeniable that addressing some environmental issues necessitates substantial budgets and cutting-edge technologies. For instance, initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, clean polluted rivers, or protect endangered species often require massive investments and sophisticated equipment. In such cases, governments and large companies, with their vast resources and expertise, are indeed better positioned to drive meaningful change.On the other hand, ordinary citizens can still play a significant role in protecting the environment. Simple actions, such as recycling, using public transport, carpooling, or conserving water, may seem insignificant individually, but collectively, they can have a substantial impact. Moreover, individuals can influence environmental policies by making conscious consumer choices, supporting eco-friendly products, and participating in local environmental initiatives. Furthermore, when ordinary people contribute to environmental protection, they also reap the benefits of a cleaner, healthier environment. For example, planting trees in local communities not only helps absorb carbon dioxide but also provides shade and improves air quality, enhancing the quality of life for residents.In conclusion, while governments and large companies undoubtedly have a critical role to play in addressing environmental problems, I believe that ordinary people can and should contribute to environmental protection. By acknowledging the importance of individual actions and combining them with the efforts of governments and corporations, we can make a more significant impact in mitigating environmental damage and preserving our planet for future generations.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;The statement that the detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV should be restricted due to its potential bad consequences on society has sparked intense debate. While some argue that such restrictions would be an infringement on freedom of the press, I largely agree with this statement, as the negative effects of graphic crime coverage on society far outweigh any potential benefits.On the one hand, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only serves to terrorize communities and leave law-abiding people increasingly apprehensive about crimes. By sensationalizing crime stories, media outlets often prioritize ratings over responsible reporting, creating a distorted view of reality that perpetuates fear and anxiety among the public. For instance, the media's obsession with violent crimes can create a false narrative that such incidents are more common than they actually are, leading to unnecessary fear and mistrust among citizens.On the other hand, detailed reports of crimes may provide potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. By broadcasting the methods and tactics employed by criminals, media outlets may inadvertently be aiding and abetting criminal activity. This is particularly concerning in the context of violent or organized crime, where the dissemination of such information can have devastating consequences.Moreover, without the prevention of criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken. The glorification of crime in the media can have a corrosive effect on societal values, as it can create a culture that romanticizes or trivializes criminal activity. This, in turn, can lead to a breakdown in social cohesion and an increase in criminal behavior, as individuals become desensitized to the consequences of their actions.In conclusion, while the restriction of crime coverage may seem like an infringement on press freedom, I believe that the potential benefits of such restrictions outweigh the costs. By limiting the detailed description of crimes in the media, we can work towards creating a society that is less fearful, less violent, and more harmonious.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. They argue that with the rise of computers, tablets, and smartphones, handwriting is becoming an outdated skill. However, I disagree with this notion, as handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning and development.Despite the convenience of modern facilities, handwriting remains an essential part of a child's educational journey. Research has shown that handwriting helps children to better retain information and process knowledge. When students write notes by hand, they are more likely to absorb and recall the material, as it engages multiple senses and cognitive pathways. In contrast, typing on a keyboard can be a more superficial activity, leading to shallower understanding and retention of information.Furthermore, poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. Legible handwriting is essential for effective communication, and illegible handwriting can lead to confusion, misinterpretation, and lost marks. In exams and assessments, handwriting is often the primary means of expression, and poor handwriting can hinder a student's ability to express their knowledge and ideas clearly.In addition, handwriting has been linked to improved cognitive development, particularly in areas such as literacy, numeracy, and creativity. Handwriting helps children to develop their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and dexterity, all of which are essential for other activities, such as drawing, crafting, and even sports.In conclusion, while modern technology has undoubtedly made our lives easier, handwriting remains a crucial skill for children to master. Rather than dismissing handwriting as an outdated practice, we should continue to emphasize its importance in schools and encourage children to develop their handwriting skills. By doing so, we can help them to become better learners, communicators, and thinkers, equipped with the skills necessary to succeed in an increasingly complex and competitive world.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";The debate surrounding the taxation of families who send their children to private schools has sparked intense discussion. Some argue that these families should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system, while others strongly disagree. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement.On one hand, it is understandable that some people who send their children to private schools feel that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. They may argue that they are already paying a significant amount for their child's education and therefore should not be required to contribute to the state system. This argument is valid, especially for those who may feel that their taxes are not being utilized efficiently.On the other hand, affluent people who send their children to private schools effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor through their taxes. By paying taxes, they are supporting the state education system, which provides opportunities for underprivileged children to receive quality education. This, in turn, helps to reduce the socio-economic gap and promotes social mobility.Moreover, a tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. If these families were exempt from paying taxes, the state education system would suffer from a significant loss of revenue. This would ultimately affect the quality of education provided to those who need it most - underprivileged children. In conclusion, while I understand the concerns of families who send their children to private schools, I believe that it is essential for them to contribute to the state education system through taxes.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;The notion that government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money has sparked intense debate. While some argue that funds should be redirected towards public services, I firmly believe that both sectors warrant investment. In my perspective, it is not a question of prioritizing one over the other, but rather striking a balance between the two.On one hand, indispensable public services like hospitals and schools are indeed worthy of every penny invested. These institutions form the backbone of a functional society, providing essential healthcare and education to citizens. It is crucial that governments allocate sufficient funds to ensure these services are accessible, efficient, and effective. The impact of underfunding these sectors would be detrimental to the well-being of citizens and the overall prosperity of the nation.On the other hand, the arts, including music and theatre, play a vital role in shaping a nation's cultural identity and fostering creativity. Investing in the arts not only enriches the lives of citizens but also contributes to the economy through tourism and job creation. Moreover, the arts have the power to bring people together, promote social cohesion, and provide a platform for self-expression and social commentary.Rather than viewing the allocation of funds as a zero-sum game, where investment in one sector comes at the expense of the other, governments should strive to find a balance that accommodates both public services and the arts. By doing so, they can create a more holistic and inclusive society that values both the practical necessities of life and the enrichment that the arts provide. In conclusion, while public services are undoubtedly essential, I firmly believe that the arts are not a waste of money and that governments should invest in both to create a well-rounded and prosperous society.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;The rapid advancement of technology has brought about significant changes to various aspects of our lives, including the way we preserve and interact with traditional cultures. While some argue that the inevitable march of technology will lead to the loss of traditional cultures, I partially agree but also believe that technology can play a role in preserving and promoting these cultures.On the one hand, it is undeniable that many traditional cultural practices and artifacts have been lost or altered as a result of modern technology. The widespread use of digital media has led to a decline in traditional forms of storytelling, music, and art. For instance, the rise of e-books has reduced the demand for traditional printing techniques, and the ease of digital communication has made handwritten letters a relic of the past. Moreover, the homogenization of global culture, facilitated by the internet and social media, has resulted in the loss of unique cultural identities.On the other hand, despite these drawbacks, technology has also made significant contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures. Digital platforms have enabled the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage, allowing people to access and learn about traditional cultures that may have been previously inaccessible. For example, online archives and museums have made it possible to digitize and showcase traditional artifacts, while social media has provided a platform for cultural exchange and education. Additionally, technology has facilitated the study of traditional cultures through data analysis and visualization, enabling researchers to gain new insights into cultural trends and patterns.In conclusion, while technology has undoubtedly led to the loss of some traditional cultural practices, I do not believe that it is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost entirely. Instead, I believe that technology can be a powerful tool in preserving and promoting traditional cultures, as long as we harness its potential in a way that complements and enhances our cultural heritage.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;The topic of university admissions has been a longstanding debate, with some arguing that institutions should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. While I understand the sentiment behind this argument, I disagree with the notion that universities should adopt a strict 50/50 ratio in every faculty.On one hand, it is undeniable that boys and girls often exhibit different interests and aptitudes when it comes to academic subjects. Many boys tend to gravitate towards science and technology fields, such as engineering and physics, while girls are often drawn to literature, education, and arts. This natural inclination should be respected, and universities should not force students into fields they are not passionate about. By allowing students to pursue their genuine interests, universities can foster a more motivated and engaged student body.On the other hand, it is also important for universities to encourage students to venture out of their comfort zones and explore diverse fields of study. For instance, universities should actively promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields to female students, who are often underrepresented in these areas. Similarly, male students should be encouraged to consider humanities and social sciences, which can provide a well-rounded education and valuable skills. By promoting diversity in course selection, universities can help break down stereotypes and provide students with a broader range of skills and knowledge.In conclusion, while I believe that universities should strive for gender equality in admissions, I do not think that a strict 50/50 ratio is necessary or desirable. Instead, universities should focus on providing a supportive and inclusive environment that allows students to pursue their genuine interests, while also encouraging them to explore diverse fields of study. By adopting this approach, universities can foster a more dynamic and well-rounded student body.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;The media's extensive coverage of celebrities has become a topic of concern for many, particularly when it comes to its impact on children. In my opinion, I strongly agree that the constant media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on young minds.Celebrities, such as movie stars, are often portrayed in the media as living luxurious lives, with lavish spending and high-profile relationships. However, this perceived ease and extravagance can be misleading. Many children may assume that these celebrities achieved their success effortlessly, without putting in the hard work and dedication required to reach their current status. This can create a distorted view of reality, leading children to believe that hard work and education are not necessary to achieve a better career and earning a living. As a result, some may develop a lack of motivation and poor work ethic, which can ultimately hinder their future prospects.Moreover, not all celebrities are positive role models. Some may engage in scandalous behavior, such as substance abuse or reckless spending, which can be particularly damaging to impressionable young minds. The media's constant coverage of these negative behaviors can normalize them in the eyes of children, leading to a desensitization of their harmful effects.Overall, I believe that the media's coverage of celebrities can have a profoundly negative impact on children. By portraying a lifestyle that is often unrealistic and unattainable, the media can create unhealthy expectations and a lack of motivation in young people.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. This concept has led to a debate on how healthcare budgets should be allocated, with some arguing that a larger portion should be diverted from treatment to health education and preventative measures. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement, as prevention is indeed better than cure.First and foremost, preventative measures are more cost-effective than treatment. Chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity are on the rise, and treating these conditions is extremely costly. By investing in health education and preventative measures, governments can reduce the incidence of these diseases, thereby reducing the financial burden on the healthcare system. Moreover, preventative measures can also improve the overall quality of life of citizens, enabling them to lead healthier and more productive lives.Another argument in favor of allocating a larger portion of the budget to health education and preventative measures is that it empowers citizens to take control of their own health. By educating citizens on healthy habits, nutrition, and disease prevention, governments can reduce the reliance on healthcare services. This, in turn, can reduce the pressure on healthcare systems, allowing them to focus on more critical cases.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment. By doing so, governments can reduce healthcare costs, improve the quality of life of citizens, and empower them to take control of their own health. This approach is not only economically viable but also morally responsible, as it prioritizes the well-being of citizens and promotes a healthier society.
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families. The traditional notion that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies often leads to the assumption that they are also solely responsible for bringing up the children. However, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is as vital a part of healthy parenthood as motherhood.While a mother's role is essential in a child's life, providing emotional support and nurturing care, a father's role is equally crucial. Fathers bring a unique set of skills and perspectives that are essential for a child's development. Research has shown that children who have involved and loving fathers tend to have better social, emotional, and cognitive development. Moreover, fathers can provide a distinct male role model, which is particularly important for boys, helping them develop a strong sense of identity and masculinity.In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child. Children learn by observing and imitating the behavior of their parents, and having two positive role models can provide a more comprehensive and balanced upbringing. A father's involvement can also help to alleviate some of the pressures on mothers, allowing them to share the responsibilities of childcare and create a more harmonious family environment.Therefore, I strongly believe that fatherhood should be emphasized as much as motherhood. By recognizing the importance of fathers in childcare, we can work towards creating a more balanced and equitable society, where both parents are valued and supported in their roles. This can have a positive impact on families and society as a whole, leading to better outcomes for children and more sustainable family relationships.
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.;"The statement that ""it is important that children should study hard at school, time spent playing sport is time wasted"" is a highly debatable topic. In my opinion, I disagree with this statement. Both studying hard and playing sports are essential parts of a child's life, and it is not accurate to label one as more important than the other.On one hand, studying hard is undoubtedly crucial for a child's academic success and future prospects. It provides them with a wealth of knowledge and skills that are necessary to excel in their chosen careers. A good education lays the foundation for a child's future, and it is essential for their personal and professional growth. However, if children are only focused on studying, they may miss out on other essential aspects of development.On the other hand, playing sports is equally important for a child's physical and mental well-being. Engaging in sports activities helps children develop important life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and communication. Moreover, playing sports is an excellent way for children to stay healthy and active, which is vital for their overall development. Regular exercise has been shown to improve concentration, boost mood, and reduce stress levels, all of which are beneficial for a child's academic performance.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that time spent playing sports is time wasted. Both studying hard and playing sports are vital components of a child's life, and it is essential to strike a balance between the two. By doing so, children can reap the benefits of a good education while also developing important life skills and maintaining their physical and mental health."
