0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;The debate surrounding the upbringing of children often centers on whether they should be taught to compete or cooperate. While some argue that competition is essential for success in adulthood, others believe that cooperation is the key to becoming a more useful and well-rounded individual. In my opinion, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for their future.Teaching children to compete can have negative consequences, such as fostering a cutthroat mentality and prioritizing individual success over collective well-being. When children are encouraged to compete, they may become overly focused on winning and achieving individual goals, rather than working together towards a common objective. This can lead to an unhealthy obsession with personal achievement and a lack of empathy for others.On the other hand, teaching children to cooperate encourages teamwork, communication, and mutual respect. When children learn to work together towards a common goal, they develop essential skills such as problem-solving, active listening, and conflict resolution. These skills are highly valued in the workplace and are essential for building strong relationships and achieving collective success.Moreover, a cooperative approach to learning can help to reduce stress and anxiety in children. When children feel that they are working together towards a common goal, they are more likely to feel supported and motivated. This can lead to improved academic performance and a more positive attitude towards learning.In conclusion, while competition can have its benefits, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for their future. By learning to work together and prioritize collective success, children can develop essential skills, build strong relationships, and achieve their goals in a healthy and positive way.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;The increasing trend of migration has led to a growing debate about the importance of cultural assimilation. While some argue that immigrants should abandon their old ways to integrate into their adopted society, others believe that this is not necessary. In my opinion, I disagree with the idea that immigrants should completely abandon their old customs and codes of behaviour.On the one hand, adapting to local customs and codes of behaviour is crucial for immigrants to integrate into their new society. By doing so, they can better understand the social norms and values of their adopted country, which can help them to communicate more effectively and build stronger relationships with the local community. Moreover, embracing local customs can also enhance their job prospects and overall quality of life.On the other hand, completely abandoning their old ways can lead to cultural homogenization and loss of identity. Immigrants bring with them unique cultural practices, traditions, and perspectives that can enrich the cultural diversity of their adopted country. By preserving their cultural heritage, immigrants can contribute to a more vibrant and inclusive society. Furthermore, abandoning their old customs can also lead to a sense of disconnection from their roots and family traditions, which can have negative psychological effects.In conclusion, while adapting to local customs is important for integration, it is not necessary for immigrants to completely abandon their old ways. Instead, they should strive for a balance between preserving their cultural heritage and embracing the customs of their adopted country. This approach can lead to a more inclusive and diverse society, where immigrants can maintain their cultural identity while also becoming an integral part of their new community.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;The proliferation of international tourism has sparked intense debate among individuals with varying opinions on the phenomenon. In my opinion, the rise of international tourism has both positive and negative impacts on the world.On the positive side, international tourism has become a significant source of revenue for many countries, particularly those with rich cultural heritage and natural beauty. The influx of tourists creates job opportunities, stimulates local economies, and encourages infrastructure development. Moreover, tourism promotes cross-cultural understanding and exchange, allowing people from diverse backgrounds to interact, learn from each other, and appreciate the unique customs and traditions of different nations.On the other hand, the surge in international tourism has also led to several negative consequences. The increased footfall of tourists has resulted in environmental degradation, pollution, and strain on local resources. The pressure to cater to the growing number of visitors has led to the commercialization of cultural sites, threatening their authenticity and historical significance. Furthermore, the tourism industry has been criticized for its lack of sustainability, with many resorts and hotels being built without regard for their environmental impact.Despite these concerns, I believe that international tourism can be a positive force if managed responsibly. Governments, tourism boards, and local communities must work together to implement sustainable tourism practices, such as eco-tourism and cultural tourism, which prioritize the preservation of natural and cultural resources. By doing so, the benefits of tourism can be shared equitably among all stakeholders, while minimizing its negative consequences.In conclusion, while the rise of international tourism presents both opportunities and challenges, I firmly believe that its benefits can be maximized and its drawbacks mitigated through sustainable practices and responsible management. By embracing tourism as a tool for cultural exchange and economic growth, we can create a more interconnected and environmentally conscious world.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;The rise of international tourism has become a significant phenomenon in recent years, with millions of people crossing borders to explore new cultures, experience different ways of life, and enjoy the natural beauty of foreign lands. While some view this trend as a positive development, others have concerns about its impact. In this essay, I will present my opinions on the matter, weighing both the benefits and drawbacks of international tourism.On the positive side, international tourism has the potential to foster cross-cultural understanding, tolerance, and cooperation. By interacting with people from diverse backgrounds, tourists can gain a deeper appreciation of the world's rich cultural diversity and challenge their own preconceptions. Additionally, tourism can contribute significantly to the local economy, creating jobs and generating income for communities that might otherwise struggle to make ends meet. Many countries, such as Thailand and Costa Rica, have successfully leveraged tourism to promote sustainable development and conserve their natural resources.However, there are also valid concerns about the negative consequences of international tourism. The influx of tourists can put a strain on local infrastructure, leading to issues such as overcrowding, pollution, and erosion of natural habitats. Furthermore, the commercialization of tourism can lead to the homogenization of local cultures, as unique traditions and customs are adapted to cater to the tastes of foreign visitors. Finally, there is the risk of cultural appropriation, where tourists adopt and profit from local customs without properly understanding or respecting their context.In conclusion, while I believe that international tourism can be a positive force for cultural exchange and economic development, it is crucial that we acknowledge and address the potential drawbacks. By promoting sustainable tourism practices, respecting local cultures, and supporting environmentally-friendly initiatives, we can ensure that the benefits of international tourism are shared equitably among all stakeholders.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;I partially agree with the statement that it is probably better to stay home for university study due to the difficulties a student encounters living and studying in a different culture. On one hand, studying overseas does present numerous challenges. Adapting to a new culture, language, and education system can be overwhelming, leading to initial struggles and homesickness. Moreover, students may encounter difficulties in navigating unfamiliar customs, social norms, and ways of life, which can impact their academic performance and overall well-being. Financial constraints and visa requirements can also add to the stress and uncertainty of studying abroad.On the other hand, I believe that the benefits of studying overseas far outweigh the difficulties. Not only does it provide students with a unique opportunity to experience diverse cultures and ways of life, but it also broadens their perspectives, fosters independence, and enhances their adaptability. Studying abroad exposes students to new ideas, teaching methods, and academic disciplines, which can be invaluable in shaping their academic and professional pursuits. Furthermore, the ability to navigate and thrive in a foreign environment is a highly valued skill in today's globalized job market.In addition, many universities and institutions offer extensive support services for international students, including language support, cultural orientation, and counseling, which can significantly ease the transition process. With careful planning, research, and preparation, students can mitigate the difficulties associated with studying overseas and maximize the benefits.In conclusion, while there are legitimate challenges associated with studying overseas, I believe that the benefits and opportunities offered by this experience far outweigh the difficulties. With the right mindset, support, and preparation, students can successfully navigate the challenges of studying abroad and reap the rewards of a life-changing experience.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;The trend of studying abroad has become increasingly popular among students worldwide. Every year, thousands of students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. This phenomenon can be attributed to several reasons.Firstly, students seek better educational opportunities abroad. Many institutions in developed countries offer high-quality programs that are not available in their home countries. For instance, students from developing countries may opt to study in the United States or the United Kingdom to pursue programs in cutting-edge fields such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, or nanotechnology. These programs provide students with access to state-of-the-art facilities, renowned faculty, and research opportunities that can enhance their academic and professional prospects.Secondly, studying abroad offers students a unique cultural experience. Living and studying in a foreign country exposes students to different cultures, customs, and ways of life. This experience broadens their perspectives, helps them develop cross-cultural communication skills, and fosters personal growth. Students can also develop a global network of friends and contacts that can benefit them in their future careers.Lastly, studying abroad can be a strategic move for career advancement. Employers often view studying abroad as a valuable asset, demonstrating a student's adaptability, independence, and willingness to take risks. Students who have studied abroad can bring a fresh perspective to the workplace and are more likely to be recruited by multinational companies or organizations with global operations.In conclusion, studying abroad offers students a wide range of benefits, from accessing better educational opportunities to developing valuable life skills. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the importance of studying abroad will only continue to grow.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way we consume information, leading to a significant decline in newspaper readership. While it is true that the internet has posed a significant threat to the traditional newspaper industry, I disagree that newspapers will soon become a thing of the past.On one hand, the internet has made it possible for people to access a vast array of news sources from around the world, at any time and from any location. This has led to a decline in newspaper sales, as people increasingly turn to online news sources for their daily dose of news. Furthermore, online news sources are often free, which has made them a more attractive option for many readers. Additionally, the rise of social media has also contributed to the decline of newspapers, as people increasingly turn to these platforms for their news.On the other hand, I believe that newspapers still have a vital role to play in the dissemination of news. While the internet provides a vast array of information, much of it is unverified and unreliable. Newspapers, on the other hand, employ professional journalists who are trained to verify information and provide in-depth analysis of news stories. This is particularly important for in-depth reporting on complex issues, such as politics and economics, where a deeper understanding of the issues is required.Furthermore, newspapers provide a unique tactile experience that is often missing from online news sources. The physical act of holding a newspaper and turning its pages provides a sensory experience that many readers still cherish. Moreover, newspapers have a longer shelf life, allowing readers to keep them for reference or pass them on to others.In conclusion, while the rise of the internet has undoubtedly posed a significant threat to the newspaper industry, I believe that newspapers will continue to have a vital role to play in the dissemination of news. Their unique combination of in-depth reporting, tactile experience, and longevity will ensure that they remain a relevant and important source of news for years to come.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";For a country to develop successfully, a government's budget allocation plays a crucial role. While investing in universities is essential for producing skilled workforce, I firmly believe that a government should focus its budget more on very young children's education. This approach has numerous long-term benefits that can propel a country towards sustainable growth and prosperity.First and foremost, early childhood education lays the foundation for future academic success. Research has consistently shown that children who receive quality education during their formative years tend to perform better academically and socially. By investing in young children's education, a government can ensure that its citizens develop strong cognitive skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. These skills are essential for driving innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth.Moreover, investing in young children's education can have a positive impact on poverty reduction and social mobility. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds who receive quality early childhood education are more likely to break the cycle of poverty and secure better-paying jobs. This, in turn, can lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth and a reduction in social inequalities.In contrast, while universities are important for producing skilled workforce, they tend to cater to a smaller segment of the population. University education is often more expensive, and the benefits may not trickle down to the broader society as quickly as they would with investments in early childhood education.Furthermore, a government that prioritizes young children's education demonstrates its commitment to the well-being and development of its citizens. This can lead to increased trust and social cohesion, which are essential for a country's stability and prosperity.In conclusion, while universities are important, a government should focus its budget more on very young children's education. This approach can have long-term benefits for a country's economic growth, poverty reduction, and social mobility. By investing in young children's education, a government can lay the foundation for a brighter, more prosperous future.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";Title: The Essential Qualities of a Good RoommateLiving with a roommate is a common experience for many students attending school or university. It can be a great opportunity to develop social skills, share responsibilities, and create lasting friendships. However, a harmonious roommate relationship requires certain essential qualities. In this essay, we will explore the importance of communication, respect, and responsibility in making a good roommate.Effective communication is the foundation of a good roommate relationship. A roommate who communicates openly and honestly can prevent misunderstandings and resolve conflicts in a timely manner. For instance, if a roommate is planning a loud party, they should inform their roommate in advance to avoid disturbing their study or sleep. This consideration demonstrates respect for each other's space and time.Respect is another vital quality of a good roommate. It involves recognizing and valuing each other's differences, boundaries, and personal space. For example, a roommate should respect their roommate's belongings and not borrow or use them without permission. This respect fosters trust and creates a comfortable living environment.Responsibility is also crucial in a roommate relationship. A responsible roommate takes care of their share of household chores, pays their rent on time, and maintains a clean and tidy living space. This responsibility helps distribute the workload evenly and prevents resentment. For example, a roommate who does their share of cleaning up after a party demonstrates their commitment to maintaining a clean and comfortable living space.In conclusion, a good roommate possesses essential qualities such as communication, respect, and responsibility. These qualities help create a harmonious living environment, prevent conflicts, and foster a positive roommate relationship. By demonstrating these qualities, roommates can enjoy a comfortable and enjoyable living experience while pursuing their academic goals.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;The question of whether governments should prioritize improving roads and highways or investing in public transportation has been a long-standing debate. In my opinion, governments should allocate more funds to enhance public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and subways. This decision is driven by several compelling reasons.Firstly, public transportation is a more environmentally friendly option compared to private vehicles. By investing in efficient and reliable public transportation, governments can encourage citizens to switch from personal vehicles to public transport, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to a cleaner environment. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, a single commuter using public transportation can reduce their carbon footprint by approximately 20 pounds of carbon dioxide per day. This collective reduction in emissions can have a significant impact on mitigating climate change.Secondly, improving public transportation can alleviate traffic congestion and promote economic growth. Well-designed public transportation systems can reduce travel times, increase productivity, and make cities more attractive to businesses and tourists. A study by the American Public Transportation Association found that every dollar invested in public transportation generates approximately four dollars in economic returns. By investing in public transportation, governments can stimulate local economies and create jobs.Lastly, prioritizing public transportation can also address issues of social equity and accessibility. Public transportation can provide affordable and reliable mobility options for low-income households, elderly, and people with disabilities, who may not have access to private vehicles. By improving public transportation, governments can promote social inclusion and ensure that all citizens have equal access to opportunities and services.In conclusion, while investing in roads and highways is important, governments should prioritize improving public transportation systems. The environmental, economic, and social benefits of public transportation make it a more compelling investment opportunity. By allocating more funds to public transportation, governments can create more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous communities.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";"Physical exercise is an essential component of a healthy lifestyle, and incorporating it into the school day can have numerous benefits for students. While some may argue that academic studies should be the sole focus of the school day, I firmly believe that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day.First and foremost, physical exercise has been proven to improve cognitive function and concentration. Regular physical activity has been shown to enhance blood flow to the brain, boost memory, and increase focus. This, in turn, can lead to better academic performance and higher grades. Moreover, physical exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety, which are common issues faced by many students. Exercise releases endorphins, also known as ""feel-good"" hormones, which can improve mood and overall well-being.In addition to the cognitive benefits, physical exercise can also promote physical health and well-being. Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and improve overall physical fitness. This is especially important for children and adolescents, as it can help establish healthy habits that can last a lifetime.Furthermore, incorporating physical exercise into the school day can also foster social skills and teamwork. Sports and physical activities provide opportunities for students to interact with their peers, build relationships, and develop communication skills. This can help students become more confident, outgoing, and better equipped to handle social situations.In conclusion, while academic studies are undoubtedly important, I firmly believe that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. The benefits of physical exercise, including improved cognitive function, physical health, and social skills, far outweigh the potential drawbacks. By incorporating physical exercise into the school day, schools can provide students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life."
11;Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the telephone have changed the way that nations interact with each other in a global society. Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.;The rapid advancement in transportation and communication technologies has revolutionized the way nations interact with each other in a global society. The airplane and telephone are exemplary innovations that have bridged geographical divides and facilitated global connectivity. Another technological innovation that I believe is equally significant in shaping global interactions is the internet.The internet has transformed the way nations communicate, collaborate, and conduct business with each other. With the advent of email, instant messaging, and video conferencing, people from different parts of the world can now connect with each other in real-time, regardless of their geographical location. The internet has also enabled the free flow of information across borders, allowing people to access and share knowledge, ideas, and cultures.One specific reason why I choose the internet as an important technological innovation is its role in facilitating international trade and commerce. The internet has enabled businesses to reach a global market, connect with suppliers and customers, and conduct transactions online. This has led to the growth of e-commerce, which has bridged the gap between nations and enabled businesses to operate on a global scale.Moreover, the internet has also enabled governments and international organizations to collaborate and share information on a global scale. For instance, the internet has facilitated the sharing of data and research on global issues such as climate change, pandemics, and economic development. This has enabled nations to work together to address common challenges and develop global solutions.In conclusion, the internet is a significant technological innovation that has transformed the way nations interact with each other in a global society. Its impact on international communication, collaboration, and commerce has been profound, and it continues to shape the way nations engage with each other in the 21st century.
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;The notion that technology has stifled the creativity of children is a contentious issue that has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that technology has hindered children's creative potential, others claim that it has opened up new avenues for innovative expression. In my opinion, technology has not necessarily made children less creative, but rather, it has altered the way they express and showcase their creativity.On one hand, it is undeniable that the over-reliance on technology can lead to a decline in traditional forms of creative expression, such as drawing, painting, and writing. The ease of accessing pre-made digital content can also stifle children's imagination, as they may rely on existing ideas rather than generating their own. Furthermore, the structured and formulaic nature of many educational apps and games can limit children's freedom to explore and experiment, which is essential for creative development.On the other hand, technology has also provided children with a wide range of new tools and platforms to express their creativity. Digital art software, video editing apps, and online music production tools have democratized access to creative outlets, enabling children to produce high-quality content that was previously inaccessible. Moreover, the internet has connected children with a global community of artists, musicians, and writers, exposing them to diverse styles, techniques, and ideas that can inspire and stimulate their creativity.In conclusion, while technology may have altered the way children express their creativity, it is not necessarily a hindrance. Rather, it has opened up new possibilities for creative expression and collaboration. By striking a balance between traditional creative pursuits and technology-enabled innovation, we can ensure that children are able to harness the benefits of technology while still developing their imagination and creativity.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;The role of teachers in a student's educational journey is a long-standing topic of discussion. While some argue that traditional classroom lessons are the most effective way of learning, others claim that alternative sources, such as the internet and television, can provide an equally enriching educational experience. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and provide my own perspective on the matter.On the one hand, lessons with teachers offer a unique and interactive learning experience that cannot be replicated by other sources. A teacher's ability to engage, motivate and adapt to the needs of their students is invaluable in fostering a deeper understanding of complex concepts. Moreover, the face-to-face interaction and real-time feedback that a teacher provides can facilitate a more effective learning process. Additionally, a teacher's experience and expertise enable them to provide context, answer questions and clarify doubts in a way that other sources may not.On the other hand, it is undeniable that the internet and television have revolutionized the way we access information. The vast array of educational resources available online, such as online courses, educational videos and podcasts, have made it possible for students to learn at their own pace and convenience. Furthermore, the internet has bridged geographical gaps, allowing students to access knowledge and expertise from all over the world.In conclusion, while alternative sources have their advantages, I believe that lessons with teachers are still the most effective way of learning. However, I also acknowledge that a combination of both traditional and modern methods can provide a more holistic and effective learning experience. Ultimately, the key to successful learning lies in striking a balance between the two and leveraging their respective strengths to create a engaging and enriching educational experience.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;The advent of email and text messaging has undoubtedly transformed the way we communicate, offering unparalleled convenience and speed. However, the notion that these technological advancements are seriously threatening the status of written language is a topic of debate. In my opinion, while there are some concerns, the impact of email and text messaging on written language is not as severe as it is often perceived.On one hand, the rise of email and text messaging has led to a decline in the use of formal written language. The brevity and informality of these communication modes have made it acceptable to use abbreviations, slang, and grammatical errors. This can be seen as a threat to the status of written language, as it undermines the importance of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Furthermore, the over-reliance on technology can lead to a decline in writing skills, as individuals may rely on auto-correct features and spell-checkers rather than developing their own writing abilities.On the other hand, email and text messaging have also opened up new avenues for written communication, making it more accessible and convenient for people to express themselves in writing. These technologies have enabled people to communicate with others across geographical distances, fostering global connections and exchanges of ideas. Moreover, the rise of online writing platforms and blogs has provided new opportunities for writers to share their work and connect with readers.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the impact of email and text messaging on written language, I do not entirely agree that they are seriously threatening its status. Instead, these technologies have transformed the way we communicate, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to harness these technologies in a way that promotes effective and nuanced written communication.
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";The use of animals for the benefit of human beings has long been a topic of debate. Some people believe that it is acceptable to use animals for human purposes, while others argue that it is morally wrong to exploit animals in this way. In my opinion, the use of animals for human benefit is a complex issue that requires careful consideration.On one hand, animals have been used for centuries to provide food, clothing, and other essential products for human survival. For example, cattle are raised for meat, milk, and leather, while sheep are raised for wool. In these cases, the use of animals is seen as a necessary part of human life. Additionally, animals are also used in medical research, which has led to numerous breakthroughs in human health and the development of life-saving treatments.On the other hand, the exploitation of animals for human purposes can be cruel and inhumane. Factory farming, for instance, involves the mass production of animals in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, leading to immense suffering and distress. Similarly, the use of animals in entertainment, such as in circuses and zoos, can be seen as a form of exploitation, where animals are kept in captivity for human amusement.In my opinion, the use of animals for human benefit is only acceptable when it is done in a humane and sustainable manner. This means ensuring that animals are treated with respect and care, and that their welfare is prioritized. For example, free-range farming and sustainable animal husbandry practices can provide a more humane alternative to factory farming. Moreover, alternative methods to animal testing, such as in vitro testing, should be explored and developed.In conclusion, the use of animals for human benefit is a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach. While animals have been used for centuries to provide essential products and services, their exploitation must be done in a humane and sustainable manner. By prioritizing animal welfare and exploring alternative methods, we can ensure that the use of animals for human benefit is done in a way that is respectful and responsible.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;I disagree with the statement that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. While it is true that television can be a distraction and may reduce face-to-face interaction, it is not the sole culprit for the decline in communication among loved ones.Firstly, television can also serve as a tool for social bonding. For instance, watching a favorite TV show or sports event together can create a sense of togetherness and shared experience among family members or friends. Many people gather to watch popular TV shows or sports, which can actually encourage communication and social interaction.Secondly, the impact of television on communication is often exaggerated. Other factors, such as the rise of social media and busy lifestyles, play a more significant role in hindering face-to-face interaction. With the increasing demands of work, school, and other responsibilities, people may have less time to engage in conversations, regardless of whether they watch TV or not.Thirdly, television can even facilitate communication by providing topics for discussion. News programs, documentaries, and educational shows can spark interesting conversations and debates, which can strengthen relationships and foster a sense of connection among viewers.Finally, it is worth noting that communication is not solely dependent on face-to-face interaction. People can communicate effectively through various means, including phone calls, text messages, and video conferencing. In fact, technology has made it easier for people to stay in touch with each other, regardless of their physical location.In conclusion, while television may have some negative effects on communication, it is not the primary cause of the decline in communication among friends and family. By acknowledging the complexities of the issue and considering multiple perspectives, we can work towards finding ways to balance our screen time with meaningful social interaction.
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;The debate about university admissions has sparked intense discussion in recent years, with some arguing that institutions should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. While I understand the reasoning behind this proposal, I only partially agree with it.On one hand, achieving a balanced ratio of male and female students in every subject can be beneficial for creating a diverse and inclusive learning environment. This approach can foster a sense of equality and promote collaboration among students from different backgrounds. For instance, in male-dominated fields such as engineering and computer science, having more female students can bring different perspectives and ideas to the table, enriching the overall learning experience. Additionally, equal representation can help to break down stereotypes and challenge traditional gender roles, encouraging more women to pursue careers in male-dominated fields.On the other hand, I disagree with the idea of imposing strict quotas for male and female students in every subject. This approach can lead to unfair treatment of applicants, as universities may be forced to reject qualified candidates based solely on their gender. Furthermore, some subjects may naturally attract more students of one gender than the other, and trying to artificially balance the numbers can be counterproductive. For example, nursing and education programs tend to have more female students, while engineering and physics programs tend to have more male students. Imposing quotas in these subjects could lead to less qualified students being accepted, ultimately compromising the quality of education.In conclusion, while I agree that achieving a balanced ratio of male and female students in every subject is desirable, I do not think that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. Instead, institutions should focus on creating an inclusive and supportive environment that encourages students of all genders to pursue their interests and passions. By doing so, universities can promote diversity and equality without compromising the quality of education.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;When it comes to young adults and their living arrangements, opinions are divided on whether independence from their parents is better or living with their families for a longer time. In my opinion, both options have their pros and cons, but living with family for a longer period is generally better.On one hand, gaining independence from one's parents as soon as possible has its advantages. Young adults who live on their own learn to take responsibility for their daily lives, make financial decisions, and develop problem-solving skills. They are also free to make their own choices and decisions without having to answer to anyone else. However, this independence can be overwhelming for some young adults, leading to financial struggles, stress, and feelings of loneliness.On the other hand, living with family for a longer time has numerous benefits. For one, it allows young adults to save money on living expenses, which can be used to pursue higher education or pay off student loans. Additionally, living with family provides emotional support and guidance, which is crucial during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Family members can offer valuable advice, help with decision-making, and provide a sense of belonging. Furthermore, living with family can also promote cultural and traditional values, as young adults are more likely to learn from their elders and appreciate their heritage.In conclusion, while gaining independence is important for young adults, living with family for a longer time has more benefits. It provides financial stability, emotional support, and a sense of belonging, all of which are essential for a young adult's transition into adulthood.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;The responsibility of cleaning up the environment is a contentious issue, with some people believing it falls squarely on the government, while others think it should be the duty of companies and private individuals. In my opinion, the responsibility should be shared among all three entities.On one hand, governments have the authority and resources to implement policies and regulations that can significantly impact the environment. They can establish laws and standards to limit pollution, conserve natural resources, and promote sustainable practices. Moreover, governments can also provide funding and support for environmental initiatives and projects. However, governments alone cannot solve the environmental problems, and relying solely on them may lead to a lack of personal responsibility among citizens.On the other hand, companies and private individuals also have a crucial role to play in cleaning up the environment. Companies can adopt sustainable practices, reduce waste, and invest in renewable energy. Private individuals can also make environmentally-friendly choices, such as reducing their carbon footprint, conserving water, and recycling. Moreover, companies and individuals can also participate in community clean-up initiatives and support environmental organizations.Ultimately, the responsibility of cleaning up the environment should be a collective effort. Governments can provide the framework and resources, while companies and private individuals can take action and make conscious choices. By working together, we can achieve a significant impact and create a more sustainable future. It is essential to recognize that environmental protection is a shared responsibility, and we must all contribute to mitigate the environmental challenges we face today.In conclusion, the responsibility of cleaning up the environment should not be the sole duty of one entity. Instead, it should be a collaborative effort among governments, companies, and private individuals. By acknowledging our shared responsibility, we can work together to protect the environment and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;The notion that high sales of a product are primarily driven by effective advertising strategies is a widely debated topic. While advertising plays a crucial role in promoting products and influencing consumer behavior, it is not the sole determinant of sales success. In this essay, I will argue that advertising is a significant contributor to high sales, but not the only factor.On one hand, good advertising strategies are essential in capturing the attention of potential customers, building brand awareness, and creating a desire for a product. Effective advertisements can differentiate a product from its competitors, highlighting its unique features and benefits. Moreover, advertising can also influence consumer perception and purchasing decisions by creating an emotional connection with the target audience. For instance, iconic brands like Coca-Cola and Nike have achieved remarkable sales success through their memorable and engaging advertising campaigns.On the other hand, there are several other factors that can significantly impact sales, even if advertising strategies are subpar. Product quality, price, and availability are critical determinants of sales success. A product that meets the needs and expectations of customers, is competitively priced, and is readily available is more likely to generate high sales, regardless of the advertising strategy. Additionally, word-of-mouth referrals, customer reviews, and social media buzz can also drive sales by creating a positive reputation and credibility for a product.Furthermore, in today's digital age, social media influencers and online content creators have become significant sales drivers, often rivalling traditional advertising methods. For example, beauty and fashion brands have achieved remarkable sales success through partnerships with social media influencers, who showcase products to their massive followings.In conclusion, while good advertising strategies are undoubtedly a crucial factor in driving sales, they are not the only determinant of sales success. Product quality, price, availability, word-of-mouth referrals, and social media influence also play significant roles. A comprehensive sales strategy that incorporates a combination of these factors is more likely to achieve high sales, rather than relying solely on advertising.
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";The notion that a high percentage of young people attending university is beneficial to a country is a topic of debate. On one hand, proponents of higher education argue that it is crucial for a country's development, as it equips young people with skills and knowledge that are essential for a country's economic growth and competitiveness. Universities provide a platform for young people to acquire expertise in various fields, enabling them to contribute meaningfully to the workforce. Moreover, educated individuals are more likely to innovate, start businesses, and create jobs, thereby driving economic progress.On the other hand, critics argue that an over-reliance on university education can lead to unemployment. When a large number of young people pursue higher education, the job market becomes saturated with graduates, leading to a surplus of skilled workers. As a result, many graduates may find themselves unemployed or underemployed, as there may not be enough job opportunities to match the number of graduates. Furthermore, the emphasis on university education can lead to a devaluation of vocational skills and technical training, which are equally important for a country's development.In my opinion, while a high percentage of young people attending university is beneficial to a country, it is not the only factor that determines a country's success. A balanced approach to education, which includes both university education and vocational training, is more likely to yield positive outcomes. Governments should also invest in creating jobs and providing opportunities for graduates to apply their skills and knowledge. Ultimately, a country's development depends on a combination of factors, including education, innovation, and economic policies. By adopting a holistic approach to development, a country can reap the benefits of a highly educated workforce while minimizing the risks of unemployment.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;"The widespread use of mobile phones has brought about numerous benefits, including increased connectivity, access to information, and improved communication. However, there are also significant social, medical, and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones.Social problems related to mobile phone use include addiction, social isolation, and decreased face-to-face communication skills. Many individuals, especially young people, spend an inordinate amount of time on their mobile phones, leading to a decline in physical activity and social interaction. Additionally, the constant need to stay connected can lead to feelings of anxiety and stress when phone use is restricted.From a medical perspective, mobile phone use has been linked to a range of health problems. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, which are emitted by mobile phones, as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"". Prolonged mobile phone use has also been linked to sleep disturbances, eye strain, and musculoskeletal problems.Technical problems associated with mobile phones include e-waste, security breaches, and radiation exposure. The rapid obsolescence of mobile phones has resulted in a significant increase in electronic waste, with many phones ending up in landfills or incinerators. Furthermore, the increased use of mobile phones has created new opportunities for cybercrime, with many users falling victim to phishing scams, identity theft, and other forms of cyberattacks.While the problems associated with mobile phone use are significant, they do not necessarily outweigh the benefits. Mobile phones have revolutionised the way we communicate, access information, and navigate our surroundings. However, it is crucial that users are aware of the potential problems and take steps to mitigate them, such as following safe usage guidelines, using phones responsibly, and disposing of them in an environmentally friendly manner. By doing so, we can maximise the benefits of mobile phone use while minimising the risks."
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;The use of computers has become an integral part of our daily lives, and children are no exception. While computers offer numerous benefits, such as access to information and educational resources, excessive use can have detrimental effects on children. In this essay, I will argue that using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children.One of the primary concerns is the impact on physical health. Spending hours sitting in front of a computer can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity, poor posture, and other health problems. Moreover, excessive screen time can disrupt sleep patterns, as the blue light emitted from screens can interfere with the production of melatonin, the sleep hormone. This can result in fatigue, decreased concentration, and poor academic performance.Another significant negative effect is the impact on social skills and relationships. Excessive computer use can lead to social isolation, as children spend more time interacting with screens than with peers and family members. This can hinder the development of essential social skills, such as communication, empathy, and conflict resolution.Furthermore, computer use can also affect cognitive development. Excessive exposure to screens can lead to decreased attention span, as children become accustomed to the instant gratification and constant stimulation provided by computers. This can make it challenging for them to focus on tasks that require sustained attention and effort.In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, excessive use can have more negative than positive effects on children. Parents and caregivers must establish guidelines and monitor computer use to ensure a healthy balance between screen time and other aspects of childhood development. By doing so, we can help children harness the benefits of computers while minimizing the potential drawbacks.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;The construction of a large factory near our community has been a topic of discussion among residents in recent months. While some people welcome the new development, others are concerned about its potential impact on our community. In this essay, we will examine both the advantages and disadvantages of having a large factory near our community.On the one hand, the large factory brings several benefits to our community. Firstly, it creates new job opportunities for local residents, both during the construction phase and after the factory becomes operational. This can help reduce unemployment rates and improve the overall economic well-being of our community. Additionally, the factory's presence can attract new businesses and services to the area, such as shops, restaurants, and hotels, which can further boost the local economy.On the other hand, the large factory also has some negative impacts on our community. One of the main concerns is the potential environmental impact. The factory's operations can generate air and water pollution, which can harm the local ecosystem and affect the health of nearby residents. Furthermore, the increased traffic and noise generated by the factory's activities can also be a nuisance to those living in the surrounding area.Another disadvantage of the factory is the strain it can put on local infrastructure. The influx of new workers and businesses can put pressure on our community's roads, schools, and healthcare services. This can lead to increased congestion, overcrowding, and costs for local residents.In conclusion, the large factory near our community is a double-edged sword. While it brings new economic opportunities and jobs, it also poses environmental and infrastructural challenges. To mitigate these negative impacts, it is essential for the factory's management to work closely with local authorities and residents to implement measures that minimize the factory's footprint on our community.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;The advent of modern technology and convenience foods has made food preparation significantly easier in recent years. This shift has sparked a heated debate about whether this development is a good thing or not. In this essay, we will examine both sides of the argument and offer a conclusion.On the one hand, the ease of food preparation is undoubtedly a blessing for many people. With the rise of ready-to-eat meals, microwaveable dishes, and meal delivery services, individuals with busy lifestyles can quickly and easily access nutritious food without having to spend hours in the kitchen. This convenience also enables people with disabilities or mobility issues to maintain their independence and prepare meals with minimal effort. Furthermore, the abundance of pre-cut, pre-cooked, and pre-seasoned ingredients has made cooking more accessible to those who lack culinary skills or confidence.On the other hand, the ease of food preparation has also led to some negative consequences. The prevalence of processed and packaged foods has contributed to the growing obesity and health epidemics in many countries. These foods are often high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats, which can lead to a range of health problems when consumed excessively. Additionally, the reliance on convenience foods has led to a decline in traditional cooking skills and a disconnection from the food we eat. Many people are no longer aware of the ingredients, nutrients, and preparation methods involved in their meals, which can lead to a lack of appreciation for the food we eat.In conclusion, while the ease of food preparation has many benefits, particularly for those with busy lifestyles or disabilities, it also has some negative consequences, such as the promotion of unhealthy eating habits and a disconnection from traditional cooking skills. Ultimately, a balance between convenience and healthy, mindful eating is necessary to fully appreciate the benefits of easy food preparation.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;The assertion that the best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid is a highly debated topic. While financial aid can undoubtedly play a crucial role in supporting the development of these nations, I disagree that it is the only way to assist them.On one hand, financial aid can be instrumental in addressing immediate needs such as poverty, hunger, and lack of access to basic services like healthcare and education. It can also be used to fund infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, and energy generation, which are essential for economic growth. For instance, the Millennium Development Goals initiative, which provided financial aid to developing countries, led to significant improvements in poverty reduction, healthcare, and education.On the other hand, relying solely on financial aid can create dependencies and undermine the long-term development of these countries. Financial aid can also be inefficiently used, with a significant portion being lost to corruption, mismanagement, and debt servicing. Moreover, financial aid does not address the root causes of underdevelopment, such as lack of institutional capacity, inadequate policies, and limited human resources.Alternative forms of assistance, such as technical assistance, capacity building, and technology transfer, can be more effective in promoting sustainable development. For example, providing training and capacity-building programs can enhance the skills and knowledge of local professionals, enabling them to design and implement development projects that are tailored to their country's specific needs. Furthermore, technology transfer can facilitate the adoption of innovative solutions, such as renewable energy and digital technologies, which can drive economic growth and improve living standards.In conclusion, while financial aid can be a valuable tool in supporting developing countries, it is not the only way to assist them. A more holistic approach that combines financial aid with technical assistance, capacity building, and technology transfer can be more effective in promoting sustainable development and reducing poverty in these nations.
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;The assertion that society should ban all forms of advertising because it has no purpose and causes damage is a contentious issue. While some may argue that advertising has no inherent value and can lead to various societal ills, I firmly disagree with the notion that it should be banned entirely.On one hand, it is true that some forms of advertising can have negative consequences. For instance, advertisements can perpetuate unrealistic beauty standards, contribute to the objectification of women, and promote materialism and consumerism. Moreover, targeted advertising can be invasive and manipulative, particularly when it comes to children and vulnerable populations. However, these concerns do not necessarily mean that all forms of advertising are devoid of purpose or should be banned.On the other hand, advertising plays a vital role in the functioning of modern economies and societies. It informs consumers about available products and services, helps businesses to reach their target audiences, and facilitates competition. Advertising also supports the media and entertainment industries, which rely heavily on ad revenue to produce content. Furthermore, advertising can be a powerful tool for social good, raising awareness about important issues, promoting public health, and encouraging positive behaviors.Rather than banning all forms of advertising, it would be more effective to regulate the industry and implement stricter standards for responsible advertising practices. Governments and regulatory bodies can work to ensure that advertisements are truthful, transparent, and respectful of diverse audiences. Moreover, companies can be incentivized to adopt ethical advertising practices that promote positive values and societal goals.In conclusion, while some forms of advertising can have negative consequences, it is not accurate to say that it has no purpose or should be banned entirely. Instead, it is crucial to find a balance between the benefits of advertising and the need to protect consumers and society from its potential harms.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;The roles of women in society have undergone significant changes over the years, with more opportunities available to them than ever before. While some people believe that women should focus on earning a living, others think that their primary responsibility lies in taking care of the household. In my opinion, women should have the freedom to choose their path, as both options are equally important and valuable.On one hand, women's participation in the workforce is essential for their personal and economic growth. Working outside the home allows them to develop new skills, gain financial independence, and contribute to the family income. This, in turn, can lead to improved living standards and greater autonomy. Moreover, women's involvement in various industries can bring diverse perspectives and innovative ideas, benefiting society as a whole.On the other hand, the role of women in caring for the household is equally vital. Raising children, managing the home, and providing emotional support to family members are crucial responsibilities that require dedication, patience, and love. Women's nurturing qualities and multitasking abilities make them well-suited for these tasks, which are essential for the well-being and development of their families.Rather than pitting these two roles against each other, we should recognize that they are not mutually exclusive. Many women successfully balance work and family responsibilities, and this should be acknowledged and supported. Ultimately, the decision to work or care for the household should be a personal choice, based on individual circumstances and priorities.In conclusion, women should have the freedom to choose their path, whether it is pursuing a career or caring for their families. Both options are valuable and important, and women should be supported and respected in their choices. By embracing diversity and promoting equality, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where women can thrive in all aspects of life.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";The notion that the government should provide primary and secondary education, but not university education, has sparked intense debate. While some argue that university education should be the sole responsibility of individuals, others claim that the government should bear some of the costs. In my opinion, I agree to a certain extent with the proposition.On one hand, primary and secondary education are fundamental rights that every citizen should have access to, regardless of their socio-economic background. Governments have a moral obligation to ensure that every child receives a basic education, as it is essential for their cognitive, social, and emotional development. By providing free primary and secondary education, governments can help bridge the gap between the rich and the poor, fostering a more equitable society.On the other hand, university education is a different story. While it is still an important aspect of a person's educational journey, it is not as essential as primary and secondary education. University education is often specialized and career-oriented, and individuals who pursue higher education typically do so with the intention of securing better job prospects and higher salaries. In this sense, it can be argued that individuals or their parents should bear the costs of university education, as they will be the primary beneficiaries of the investment.However, I must also acknowledge that there are cases where individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds may struggle to afford university education, even with scholarships and financial aid. In such cases, the government should provide support to ensure that these individuals are not denied the opportunity to pursue higher education due to financial constraints.In conclusion, while I agree that the government should provide primary and secondary education, I believe that university education should be a shared responsibility between individuals and the government. Governments should provide support and financial aid to those who need it most, while individuals or their parents should bear the primary costs of university education. By striking a balance between the two, we can ensure that education remains accessible and affordable for all, regardless of socio-economic background.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;The rise of vehicles on British roads, from a single car in 1888 to a staggering 29 million by the year 2000, has undoubtedly led to an exponential increase in air pollution, congestion, and safety hazards. In light of these pressing issues, I firmly agree that alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to regulate car ownership and use.First and foremost, promoting alternative forms of transport, such as cycling, walking, and public transport, can significantly reduce our reliance on personal vehicles. Governments can incentivize the use of eco-friendly modes of transport by investing in bike lanes, pedestrianized zones, and efficient public transport systems. For instance, cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam have successfully integrated cycling infrastructure, leading to a substantial decrease in vehicle emissions.Furthermore, international laws governing car ownership and use can be instrumental in mitigating the environmental and social impacts of the automotive industry. Stricter regulations on emissions, fuel efficiency, and safety standards can ensure that car manufacturers prioritize sustainability and safety. Additionally, laws restricting car ownership, such as congestion charges and low-emission zones, can discourage unnecessary driving and encourage the use of public transport.However, some may argue that such regulations would impinge upon personal freedoms and hinder economic growth. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that the benefits of alternative transport and regulatory laws far outweigh these concerns. Not only would they contribute to a healthier environment and improved air quality, but also reduce traffic congestion, saving time and resources for individuals and businesses alike.In conclusion, as the number of vehicles on British roads continues to rise, it is imperative that we adopt a more sustainable approach to transportation. Encouraging alternative forms of transport and introducing international laws to regulate car ownership and use can significantly mitigate the negative impacts of the automotive industry. By taking proactive steps, we can work towards a cleaner, safer, and more efficient transportation system for future generations.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";The notion that rich countries should provide financial assistance to poor countries has been a topic of debate for many years. In my opinion, I strongly agree that rich countries have a moral obligation to provide financial help to poor countries, albeit with certain caveats.On one hand, rich countries have a significant amount of wealth and resources at their disposal, which they can use to make a positive impact on the lives of millions of people in poor countries. Providing financial aid can help alleviate poverty, improve healthcare, education, and infrastructure, ultimately contributing to the overall development of these countries. For instance, the United States' aid to countries like Haiti after the devastating earthquake in 2010 helped save countless lives and rebuilt communities. Moreover, financial aid can also serve as a tool for rich countries to promote their foreign policy interests and strengthen diplomatic relationships with recipient countries.On the other hand, it is crucial to acknowledge that financial aid can also have unintended consequences, such as creating dependency and undermining local economies. Furthermore, there is always a risk that aid funds may be mismanaged or siphoned off by corrupt officials. Therefore, it is essential for rich countries to ensure that their aid is targeted, well-managed, and conditional upon recipient countries meeting certain standards of governance and accountability.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that rich countries should provide financial help to poor countries. However, this assistance must be provided in a responsible and sustainable manner, with a focus on empowering local communities and promoting long-term development. By doing so, rich countries can make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of people around the world and help bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";Globalization has undoubtedly brought about numerous economic benefits, connecting the world's markets and fostering unprecedented growth. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the darker side of this phenomenon, which often goes unaddressed.On the one hand, globalization has created a borderless world, where goods, services, and ideas can flow freely, stimulating economic expansion. This has led to increased job opportunities, improved standards of living, and access to a broader range of products. Multinational corporations have also taken advantage of cheap labor and favorable policies in developing countries, making goods cheaper and more accessible worldwide.On the other hand, the negative consequences of globalization should not be overlooked. One of the most significant drawbacks is the exploitation of workers in developing countries, where labor laws and regulations are often lax. Sweatshops, long working hours, and low wages have become all too common, as companies prioritize profits over people. Furthermore, globalization has led to a widening income gap between the rich and the poor, as those with the means to adapt to the changing market thrive, while those who cannot are left behind.Another concern is the environmental degradation caused by increased production and transportation. The rapid growth of international trade has resulted in a substantial rise in greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and waste, threatening the planet's ecosystems. Additionally, the homogenization of cultures and the dominance of Western values have led to the erosion of traditional practices and ways of life.In conclusion, while globalization has undoubtedly had a positive impact on the world's economies, its negative side should not be ignored. It is essential to address these issues, ensuring that the benefits of globalization are shared equitably and that the environment and cultural diversity are protected. Only by acknowledging and mitigating the negative consequences of globalization can we create a more sustainable and equitable world.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The idea of allowing children to leave school early to pursue a job has been a topic of debate. Some argue that children who may not benefit from academics and disrupt the education of others should be given the option to leave school early. However, I strongly disagree with this notion.Firstly, education is not solely about academics, but also about personal development, social skills, and character building. Schools provide a safe environment for children to grow and learn valuable life skills, which are essential for their future success. By allowing children to leave school early, we may be depriving them of these essential life skills.Moreover, it is often difficult to determine at a young age what subjects or careers will be of value to a child in the future. Many students who may struggle with academics may find their passion and talent in other areas, such as vocational skills or the arts. By giving children the option to leave school early, we may be closing doors to potential opportunities and talents that have not yet been discovered.Additionally, children who leave school early may be at a disadvantage in the job market. Many employers require a certain level of education, and children who do not have this may be limited in their job prospects. Furthermore, children who leave school early may be more likely to end up in low-paying, unskilled jobs, which can lead to a cycle of poverty and disadvantage.In conclusion, while I understand the frustration of children who may not be suited to academics, I do not think that allowing them to leave school early is the solution. Instead, schools should provide alternative programs and vocational training that cater to different learning styles and interests. This way, all children can benefit from education and have the opportunity to reach their full potential.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;The notion that high sales of popular consumer goods are primarily driven by the power of advertising, rather than genuine societal needs, is a contentious issue. While advertising undoubtedly plays a significant role in shaping consumer behavior, I believe that it is an oversimplification to suggest that advertising is the sole driving force behind sales.On the one hand, it is undeniable that advertising has a profound impact on consumer purchasing decisions. Advertisers utilize various techniques, such as emotional manipulation, celebrity endorsements, and strategic product placement, to create a perceived need for their products. These tactics can be highly effective in generating buzz and driving sales, particularly for products that are not necessarily essential. For instance, the popularity of certain fashion brands or luxury items can be largely attributed to successful advertising campaigns that create an illusion of exclusivity and desirability.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that societal needs do exist and that consumers are not merely passive recipients of advertising messages. Many consumer goods cater to genuine needs, such as food, clothing, and household essentials. In these cases, advertising may play a role in shaping consumer preferences, but it is not the primary driver of sales. Furthermore, the increasing awareness of issues such as sustainability and social responsibility has led to a growing demand for products that align with these values. This shift in consumer behavior demonstrates that societal needs and values can influence purchasing decisions, independent of advertising.In conclusion, while advertising is undoubtedly a powerful force in shaping consumer behavior, it is an exaggeration to suggest that it is the sole driver of high sales. Societal needs and values also play a significant role in influencing consumer purchasing decisions. A more nuanced understanding of the interplay between advertising and societal needs is necessary to fully comprehend the complexities of consumer behavior.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;The debate on gun ownership has been a contentious issue for years, with proponents arguing for the right to bear arms and opponents advocating for stricter regulations. In light of the alarming rate of gun-related violence and mass shootings, it is imperative that the ownership of guns be limited. The primary reason for this limitation is the significant risk of gun-related accidents and fatalities.When guns are readily available, the likelihood of accidents, intentional or otherwise, increases substantially. In the United States alone, there were over 39,000 gun-related deaths in 2020, with a considerable portion of these being accidental shootings. By limiting gun ownership, the number of firearms in circulation decreases, thereby reducing the risk of such accidents. Moreover, restricting gun ownership would also prevent individuals with a history of mental health issues or a propensity for violence from acquiring firearms, thus mitigating the risk of mass shootings.Another compelling argument for limiting gun ownership is the disproportionate impact it has on vulnerable populations, such as children and minorities. In many instances, gun violence affects these groups more severely, resulting in irreparable harm to families and communities. By implementing stricter gun control laws, we can safeguard these populations from the devastating effects of gun violence.Some may argue that limiting gun ownership infringes upon an individual's right to self-defense. However, this right must be balanced against the greater good of society. In many countries with stringent gun control laws, such as Australia and Japan, the rate of gun-related violence is significantly lower, demonstrating that alternative means of self-defense can be just as effective.In conclusion, limiting the ownership of guns is a necessary measure to prevent gun-related accidents, mass shootings, and the disproportionate impact of gun violence on vulnerable populations. By implementing stricter gun control laws, we can create a safer society where the risk of gun-related harm is minimized, and alternative means of self-defense are prioritized.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;"The impact of popular events like the football World Cup on international tensions and patriotic emotions is a topic of ongoing debate. While some argue that these events ease international tensions and provide a safe outlet for patriotic emotions, others contend that they can actually exacerbate tensions and foster negative nationalism. In my opinion, the latter perspective holds more weight.On one hand, events like the World Cup do bring people together, fostering a sense of global community and shared excitement. The tournament's global reach and massive following can help bridge cultural and linguistic divides, as fans from different countries unite in their passion for the sport. Moreover, the event provides a platform for countries to showcase their unique cultures and traditions, promoting cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.However, I firmly believe that the negative aspects of these events far outweigh their positive consequences. The intense rivalry and competition inherent in these events often lead to increased tensions between nations, as fans and governments alike become invested in their team's success. National pride and ego are at stake, and the pressure to win can lead to an ""us versus them"" mentality, perpetuating negative stereotypes and reinforcing existing prejudices. The World Cup, in particular, has been marred by instances of hooliganism, xenophobia, and racism, highlighting the darker side of nationalistic fervor.Furthermore, the commercialization of these events has created a platform for governments to engage in propaganda and nationalist rhetoric, further fueling tensions and reinforcing divisive ideologies. The Olympics, for instance, have been used as a stage for countries to demonstrate their military prowess and assert their dominance.In conclusion, while popular events like the football World Cup may provide a temporary sense of global unity and shared excitement, I firmly believe that they can also exacerbate international tensions and foster negative nationalism. As such, I disagree with the opinion that these events are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way."
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of technology have led to a debate about its impact on the gap between the rich and the poor. While some people believe that technology is exacerbating this gap, others argue that it has the opposite effect. In this essay, I will discuss both views and present my opinion.On the one hand, it can be argued that technology has increased the gap between the rich and the poor. The high cost of the latest technological devices and gadgets can be a significant barrier to access for low-income individuals. Additionally, the rapid pace of technological change means that those who are already wealthy can quickly adapt to new technologies and reap the benefits, while those who are less fortunate may struggle to keep up. This can lead to a situation where the rich become richer, while the poor are left behind.On the other hand, technology has also made many resources and opportunities available to people who may not have had access to them otherwise. For example, online education platforms and e-learning tools have made it possible for people from all over the world to access high-quality educational resources, regardless of their financial situation. Furthermore, the internet has enabled people to connect with others across the globe, and has opened up new opportunities for entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic mobility.In my opinion, while technology may have initially widened the gap between the rich and the poor, its long-term effects will ultimately be to narrow this gap. As technology becomes more widespread and affordable, it will continue to provide opportunities for education, innovation, and economic mobility that were previously inaccessible to many people. However, it is also important for governments and organizations to implement policies and programs that ensure that everyone has access to the benefits of technology, regardless of their financial situation.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;The investment of governments in outer space exploration has been a topic of debate for many years. On one hand, some people believe that the vast amount of money spent on space travel is a waste of resources, while others argue that it is a necessary step for human progress and advancement. In my opinion, the investment in outer space exploration is reasonable, and I will provide reasons to support this claim.First and foremost, space exploration has led to numerous scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements that have benefited society as a whole. For example, satellite technology, which was developed as a byproduct of space research, has revolutionized communication, navigation, and weather forecasting. Additionally, the development of memory foam, water purification systems, and solar panels are just a few examples of the many spin-off technologies that have improved our daily lives.Furthermore, investing in space exploration can also lead to significant economic benefits. Space tourism, for instance, is a growing industry that has the potential to generate billions of dollars in revenue. Moreover, the resources available in space, such as minerals and metals, can provide new opportunities for economic growth and development.Another reason why I believe that the investment in outer space exploration is reasonable is that it has the potential to ensure the survival of the human species. As we face numerous global challenges, such as climate change and nuclear proliferation, it is essential that we explore and develop alternative habitats for humanity. By investing in space exploration, we are essentially investing in the future of our species.In conclusion, while the investment in outer space exploration may seem excessive to some, I firmly believe that it is a necessary and reasonable investment for the advancement of humanity. The scientific breakthroughs, economic benefits, and potential for human survival make it a worthwhile endeavor.
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;Having a job while being a student is a common practice in many countries, especially among teenagers. This trend has sparked debate about its pros and cons. In my opinion, having a job as a teenager can be beneficial, but it also has its downsides.On the positive side, working as a student can teach teenagers valuable life skills such as time management, responsibility, and independence. Having a job requires balancing work and school commitments, which can help young people develop these essential skills that will benefit them throughout their lives. Additionally, working can provide financial independence, allowing teenagers to earn their own money and make their own purchasing decisions. This can be especially empowering for those from low-income backgrounds, who may not have access to the same opportunities as their peers.However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. For example, working can take a toll on academic performance, especially if the job demands a significant amount of time or energy. Teenagers may find it difficult to keep up with their schoolwork, leading to lower grades or decreased academic achievement. Furthermore, working can also impact extracurricular activities and social relationships, which are important for a teenager's emotional and social development.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that having a job as a teenager can be a good idea, but only if done responsibly. Teenagers should prioritize their academic commitments and ensure that their job does not interfere with their schoolwork. Parents, schools, and employers also have a role to play in supporting young people to balance work and study effectively.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;The practice of sending students to institutions or organizations to undertake unpaid work, often referred to as work experience or internship, is a common phenomenon in many schools. This arrangement is beneficial to both the students and the organizations involved, albeit to varying extents.For students, the benefits are multifaceted. Firstly, it provides them with a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world settings, thereby enhancing their understanding of the subject matter. Secondly, it enables them to develop essential skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are crucial for their future careers. Furthermore, work experience helps students to build their professional networks, gain references, and establish connections that can be beneficial in their job searches. Additionally, it allows them to explore different career paths and make informed decisions about their future.On the other hand, organizations also benefit significantly from hosting students. For instance, it provides them with an opportunity to identify and recruit talented individuals who can contribute to their growth and success. Moreover, students bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas, which can be invaluable in driving business innovation and improvement. Hosting students also enables organizations to give back to their communities, fulfill their corporate social responsibilities, and enhance their reputation. Moreover, it can be a cost-effective way for organizations to complete small projects or tasks, as students are often eager to prove themselves and gain experience.However, it is worth noting that the benefits can be undermined if the arrangement is not properly structured. For instance, if students are not given meaningful tasks or are not supervised effectively, the experience can be frustrating and unproductive. Similarly, if organizations do not provide students with adequate support or compensation, the arrangement can be seen as exploitative.In conclusion, the practice of sending students to institutions or organizations for unpaid work is beneficial to both parties involved. Students gain valuable experience, skills, and connections, while organizations benefit from fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, and the opportunity to identify and recruit talented individuals. However, it is crucial that the arrangement is properly structured to ensure that both parties derive maximum benefits.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;The idea that paying more money is the sole motivator for employees to work harder and increase their productivity is a widely debated topic. While monetary incentives can indeed play a significant role in boosting employee motivation, I disagree that it is the only possible motivation.On one hand, financial rewards can be a powerful motivator, especially in industries where employees are underpaid or undervalued. A salary increase or bonuses can provide a sense of recognition and appreciation for one's work, leading to increased job satisfaction and motivation. Furthermore, financial incentives can also attract and retain top talent in a competitive job market.On the other hand, research has shown that once basic financial needs are met, further increases in pay do not necessarily lead to proportional increases in motivation and productivity. In fact, studies have revealed that non-monetary factors such as autonomy, meaningful work, and opportunities for growth and development can be equally, if not more, effective motivators. Employees who feel engaged, challenged, and supported in their roles are more likely to be motivated to perform at their best.Moreover, overemphasizing monetary rewards can lead to unintended consequences, such as creating a transactional mindset where employees only work for the sake of a paycheck, rather than for the sake of the work itself. This can result in a lack of genuine commitment, innovation, and job satisfaction.In conclusion, while paying more money can be a motivator for employees to work harder and increase their productivity, it is not the only possible motivation. A more holistic approach that takes into account non-monetary factors, such as autonomy, meaningful work, and opportunities for growth, is necessary to truly motivate and engage employees. By recognizing the complexity of human motivation, organizations can create a more supportive and stimulating work environment that fosters both productivity and job satisfaction.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;The notion that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions can ease international tensions and release patriotic emotions in a safe way is a widely debated topic. While some may argue that these events have a positive impact on global relations and patriotism, I firmly believe that they are essential in achieving this goal.On one hand, international sporting events bring together nations from around the world, providing a platform for cultural exchange and understanding. The football World Cup, for instance, is a global phenomenon that transcends linguistic and geographical barriers, allowing people from diverse backgrounds to come together and celebrate their shared passion for the sport. This collective enthusiasm creates a sense of camaraderie and shared human experience, which can help to ease international tensions and foster a sense of global unity.On the other hand, these events also provide a safe outlet for patriotic emotions to be expressed. During international competitions, fans are encouraged to demonstrate their national pride through cheering, chanting, and waving flags. This release of patriotic fervor can be a healthy way to express national identity, rather than through aggressive or violent means. Moreover, the rivalry and competition inherent in sporting events can be a constructive way to channel national pride and competitive spirit, rather than resorting to conflict or hostility.However, it is worth noting that the impact of these events can be context-dependent and may vary depending on the specific circumstances. For instance, if national pride and rivalry are allowed to escalate into xenophobia or intolerance, then the event can have a counterproductive effect. Nevertheless, when managed and celebrated in a respectful and inclusive manner, popular events like the football World Cup can indeed play a crucial role in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe and healthy way.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;The world's increasing reliance on fossil fuels has led to severe environmental degradation, prompting calls for governments to invest in alternative energy sources. In this essay, I will argue that I strongly agree with the opinion that governments should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy.First and foremost, the burning of fossil fuels is the primary cause of climate change, which poses a significant threat to the planet's ecosystems and biodiversity. In contrast, alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are clean and renewable, producing little to no greenhouse gas emissions. By investing in these technologies, governments can reduce their country's carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future.Furthermore, alternative energy sources can also enhance energy security and reduce reliance on imported fuels. For example, countries with abundant sunlight can harness solar power to generate electricity, reducing their dependence on foreign oil. This, in turn, can improve energy independence, reduce trade deficits, and create jobs in the renewable energy sector.Additionally, promoting alternative energy sources can have economic benefits. The cost of renewable energy technologies is decreasing over time, making them more competitive with fossil fuels. Governments can incentivize businesses and individuals to invest in alternative energy by offering tax credits, grants, and other subsidies.In conclusion, I strongly agree that governments should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. The benefits of investing in renewable energy are numerous, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions to enhancing energy security and creating jobs. Governments have a critical role to play in driving the transition to a low-carbon economy, and by prioritizing alternative energy sources, they can create a more sustainable future for generations to come.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;The statement that the government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help has been a topic of debate among economists, policymakers, and social welfare experts. While some argue that direct financial aid is the most effective way to support the unemployed, others believe that it can create dependency and undermine the incentive to work. In my opinion, I agree with the statement, albeit with some reservations.On the one hand, direct financial aid can provide a vital lifeline to individuals who have lost their jobs due to circumstances beyond their control, such as economic downturns or company restructuring. It can help them meet their basic needs, maintain their dignity, and prevent them from falling into poverty. Moreover, direct financial aid can also stimulate economic growth by putting money in the pockets of people who are likely to spend it quickly, thereby boosting aggregate demand.On the other hand, there are concerns that direct financial aid can create dependency and reduce the incentive to work. If the aid is too generous or too easily available, some individuals may choose not to seek employment, preferring to rely on government handouts instead. Additionally, direct financial aid may not address the underlying causes of unemployment, such as lack of skills or education, which can lead to long-term unemployment.However, I believe that these concerns can be mitigated by designing a system of direct financial aid that is targeted, temporary, and conditional. For example, the government can provide aid only to those who are actively seeking employment, and only for a limited period, such as six months. Additionally, the aid can be tied to requirements, such as job training or education, to help individuals acquire skills that make them more employable.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the potential drawbacks of direct financial aid, I believe that it can be a valuable tool in supporting unemployed people, especially in times of economic crisis. By designing a system that is targeted, temporary, and conditional, the government can provide a vital safety net to those who need it most, while also encouraging individuals to seek employment and acquire skills that make them more employable.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;The purpose of a university has long been a topic of debate, with some arguing that it should provide graduates with practical skills for the workforce, while others believe that its primary function should be to provide access to knowledge for its own sake. In my opinion, the main function of a university should be a balance between these two perspectives.On one hand, universities should equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the workplace. With the increasingly competitive job market, it is crucial that graduates possess relevant skills and expertise to meet the demands of employers. This is particularly important for fields such as engineering, law, and medicine, where practical skills are essential for professional success. By providing students with relevant training, universities can help bridge the gap between academia and industry, ultimately leading to better career prospects for graduates.On the other hand, the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is a vital aspect of university education. Universities should foster a culture of intellectual curiosity, where students can explore and engage with various subjects without the pressure of immediate practical application. This approach allows students to develop critical thinking, analytical skills, and creativity, which are valuable in all aspects of life. Moreover, the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake can lead to groundbreaking discoveries and innovations that may not have been possible within the constraints of practical application.In conclusion, the main function of a university should be to strike a balance between providing students with practical skills and fostering a culture of intellectual curiosity. By combining these two approaches, universities can equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the workplace while also promoting a love of learning and intellectual exploration. Ultimately, this balanced approach will lead to well-rounded, employable, and intellectually curious graduates who are equipped to make a positive impact in their chosen fields.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;The statement that a zoo has no useful purpose is one that sparks intense debate. While some argue that zoos serve no purpose other than to confine and display animals for human entertainment, others see them as vital institutions for conservation, education, and research. In my opinion, zoos do serve a useful purpose, and I will explain why.Firstly, zoos play a crucial role in conservation efforts. Many zoos participate in breeding programs for endangered species, which help to increase population numbers and release animals back into the wild. For example, the California Condor Recovery Program, which was launched in the 1980s, has successfully increased the population of California condors from just 22 birds to over 500. Zoos also provide a safe haven for animals that have been injured or orphaned in the wild, offering them a second chance at life.Secondly, zoos are important educational institutions. They provide an opportunity for people, especially children, to learn about different species, their habitats, and the importance of conservation. Many zoos also offer interactive exhibits and programs that allow visitors to get up close and personal with animals, fostering a sense of wonder and respect for the natural world.Lastly, zoos are centers for scientific research. By studying animals in a controlled environment, zoos can contribute to our understanding of animal behavior, physiology, and psychology. This knowledge can be used to improve animal welfare in zoos and in the wild, as well as to inform conservation efforts.In conclusion, while some may argue that zoos serve no purpose, I firmly believe that they play a vital role in conservation, education, and research. By participating in breeding programs, providing educational opportunities, and facilitating scientific research, zoos make a valuable contribution to society.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;The advent of distance-learning programs has revolutionized the way people acquire knowledge, making it more accessible and convenient. However, the debate surrounding the effectiveness of these programs persists, with some arguing that they are inferior to traditional in-person learning. While there are valid points on both sides, I partly agree that distance-learning programs have limitations compared to attending a college or university in person.On one hand, distance-learning programs offer unparalleled flexibility, allowing students to manage their time and pace according to their needs. This is particularly beneficial for working professionals, parents, or those living in remote areas. Moreover, online courses often feature interactive multimedia content, making learning more engaging and enjoyable. With the right mindset and discipline, students can achieve the same level of academic rigor and excellence as their in-person counterparts.On the other hand, traditional in-person learning provides a more immersive and dynamic experience. Interacting with instructors and peers in real-time fosters deeper discussions, debates, and critical thinking. Students can also benefit from the campus environment, accessing libraries, laboratories, and extracurricular activities that enhance their academic and personal growth. Moreover, face-to-face interactions facilitate socialization and networking, essential for building professional relationships and securing job opportunities.In conclusion, while distance-learning programs have their advantages, I agree that they are not entirely equivalent to traditional in-person learning. The value of human interaction, campus life, and hands-on learning experiences cannot be fully replicated online. Nevertheless, distance-learning programs remain a vital option for those who require flexibility and convenience. Ultimately, the choice between distance learning and traditional in-person learning depends on individual preferences, needs, and circumstances.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";The advent of modern communication technology has undoubtedly transformed the way people interact and access information. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the benefits of this technology have not been uniformly distributed. In this essay, I will argue that while some individuals have greatly benefited from modern communication technology, there are also those who have not benefited from it at all.On one hand, modern communication technology has opened up numerous opportunities for many people. For instance, the internet and social media have enabled people to connect with others across geographical boundaries, fostering global communication and collaboration. Additionally, online platforms have made it possible for people to access information, education, and job opportunities that were previously inaccessible. Entrepreneurs, students, and professionals have all benefited from the ease and speed of communication that modern technology provides.On the other hand, there are many individuals who have not benefited from modern communication technology. For example, people living in remote or rural areas may not have access to reliable internet or mobile phone coverage, effectively cutting them off from the benefits of modern communication. Moreover, older adults or those with limited technological literacy may struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of technological advancements, leading to feelings of isolation and exclusion. Furthermore, the digital divide has also exacerbated existing socio-economic inequalities, as those who have access to modern communication technology often have an unfair advantage over those who do not.In conclusion, while modern communication technology has undoubtedly improved the lives of many individuals, it is essential to recognize that not everyone has benefited from it equally. Efforts should be made to address the digital divide and ensure that all members of society have access to the benefits of modern communication technology.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;"The debate about whether musical lessons should be made mandatory in high school education has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that it's a waste of time for students, I firmly believe that incorporating musical lessons into the high school curriculum is essential for the well-rounded development of students.Firstly, musical education has been proven to have a positive impact on cognitive skills, particularly in areas such as memory, language development, and spatial-temporal skills. Research has shown that students who receive musical training tend to perform better in math and reading, and have improved academic achievement overall. This is because musical education requires discipline, focus, and creativity, all of which are valuable skills that can be applied to other areas of academic life.Furthermore, musical education can play a significant role in fostering emotional intelligence and social skills. Playing a musical instrument or participating in a choir or band requires collaboration, teamwork, and communication. These skills are essential for building strong relationships and achieving success in both personal and professional life.Additionally, musical education can provide students with a creative outlet and a means of self-expression. In an increasingly competitive and high-stress academic environment, musical lessons can offer a much-needed respite and allow students to tap into their creative potential.While some may argue that musical lessons take away from more ""practical"" subjects, I would counter that musical education is just as valuable. In today's society, creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence are just as important as academic achievement. By making musical lessons mandatory, we can provide students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for success in all areas of life."
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;I disagree with the statement that universities should allocate the same amount of money to their students' sports activities as they do to their university libraries. While sports and physical activities are essential for students’ overall well-being and development, I believe that libraries play a more critical role in supporting the academic mission of universities.University libraries are the heart of academic institutions, providing students with access to a vast array of resources, including books, journals, databases, and other educational materials. These resources are essential for students to complete their coursework, conduct research, and achieve their academic goals. Libraries also offer a quiet and conducive study environment, which is vital for students to focus and learn. In contrast, sports activities, although important for students’ physical and mental health, are not as directly related to the academic mission of universities.Furthermore, libraries are often used by a larger number of students than sports facilities. Every student, regardless of their interest in sports, needs to use the library to complete their studies. On the other hand, only students who are interested in sports and have the necessary skills and dedication participate in sports activities. Therefore, allocating the same amount of money to sports activities as to libraries may not be the most efficient use of university resources.That being said, universities should still provide adequate funding for sports activities, as they play a vital role in promoting students’ physical and mental well-being. However, the amount allocated to sports activities should be proportional to the number of students who participate in them and the benefits they provide. In conclusion, while sports activities are important, I believe that universities should prioritize funding for their libraries, as they are more critical to the academic success of their students.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";The rapid spread of English as a global language has led to concerns about the decline of lesser-known languages. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that the advantages of English as a global language outweigh the disadvantages, but only to a certain extent.On the one hand, the widespread use of English has numerous benefits. It has become the language of international communication, facilitating global business, education, science, and culture. English has bridged the gap between nations, allowing people from diverse linguistic backgrounds to connect and exchange ideas. Moreover, the economic benefits of speaking English cannot be overstated, as it has become a valuable skill in the job market, opening up opportunities for individuals and countries alike.On the other hand, the decline of lesser-known languages is a significant loss of cultural heritage and diversity. Language is an integral part of a community's identity, and its loss can lead to cultural homogenization. Moreover, the extinction of languages also means the loss of traditional knowledge, customs, and history, which are often embedded in the language itself. According to UNESCO, a language goes extinct every 14 days, which is alarming and highlights the need for language preservation.However, it is essential to note that the advantages of English as a global language do not necessarily have to come at the expense of lesser-known languages. In fact, many languages can coexist and even complement each other. Efforts to preserve and promote endangered languages, such as language documentation, education, and community engagement, can help mitigate the negative impacts of globalization.In conclusion, while the advantages of English as a global language are significant, they should not come at the expense of cultural diversity and language heritage. It is crucial to strike a balance between promoting English as a global language and preserving lesser-known languages, recognizing the value of linguistic diversity and the importance of cultural preservation.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The debate over whether humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit or protect their rights has been ongoing for years. On one hand, some people argue that animals are a valuable resource and should be used to improve human life. For example, animals have been used for centuries for food, clothing, and transportation, and have played a significant role in advancing human civilization. Additionally, some argue that using animals for scientific research has led to numerous medical breakthroughs and improved human health.On the other hand, others strongly believe that animals have inherent rights and should be treated with respect and compassion. They argue that animals are sentient beings, capable of feeling pain, joy, and suffering, just like humans. As such, they should be protected from exploitation and cruelty. Animal rights activists also point out that many animal-based industries, such as factory farming and circuses, prioritize profit over animal welfare, leading to inhumane treatment and living conditions.Furthermore, protecting animal rights is not only a moral obligation but also essential for maintaining ecological balance. The loss of biodiversity due to human activities has severe consequences for the environment and human societies. By respecting animal rights, we can ensure that their habitats are preserved, and their populations thrive.In conclusion, while some people believe that animals should be used for human benefit, others argue that their rights should be protected. A balanced approach that prioritizes animal welfare and conservation while allowing for sustainable use can be a viable solution. Ultimately, recognizing the intrinsic value of animal life and treating them with respect and kindness is essential for creating a more compassionate and sustainable world.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";The advent of modern technology has revolutionized the way people experience and interact with art exhibitions. With the rise of virtual tours, online platforms, and digital displays, it has become possible for individuals to view exhibitions from the comfort of their own homes. However, I disagree with the notion that museums and art galleries will disappear soon due to this development.While technology has certainly increased accessibility to art, it cannot replace the tangible and immersive experience of visiting a physical museum or gallery. The sensory experience of seeing a masterpiece up close, feeling the texture of a sculpture, and being surrounded by the ambiance of an exhibition space is irreplaceable. Moreover, museums and galleries offer a social experience, allowing visitors to engage with others who share similar interests and passions.Furthermore, museums and galleries are not just about displaying art, but also about preserving and conserving it for future generations. They employ experts who specialize in restoration, conservation, and curation, ensuring that the artwork is preserved in optimal conditions. Online platforms, on the other hand, may not be able to replicate the level of expertise and care that physical institutions provide.Additionally, museums and galleries often serve as community hubs, offering educational programs, workshops, and events that foster engagement and creativity. They also play a significant role in promoting cultural exchange, understanding, and appreciation, which is essential in today's globalized world.In conclusion, while technology has certainly made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home, I believe that museums and art galleries will continue to thrive. They offer a unique and enriching experience that cannot be replicated online. Instead, I envision a future where technology complements the physical experience, allowing museums and galleries to reach a wider audience and enhance their offerings, rather than replace them.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;The debate on whether teenagers should learn all school subjects or focus on their strengths and interests has been ongoing. While some argue that learning a wide range of subjects is essential, others claim that specialisation is the key to success. In this essay, we will examine both perspectives and offer an opinion.On the one hand, learning all school subjects has its advantages. It allows students to gain a broad knowledge base, develop a range of skills, and foster a deeper understanding of the world around them. By studying a variety of subjects, students can identify areas they may not have previously considered, potentially discovering hidden talents or interests. Furthermore, a well-rounded education prepares students for an ever-changing job market, where adaptability and versatility are highly valued.On the other hand, focusing on subjects that students are best at or interested in can lead to greater academic achievement and personal satisfaction. When students concentrate on areas they excel in, they are more likely to develop a passion for learning, leading to improved motivation and engagement. Additionally, specialisation enables students to delve deeper into their chosen subjects, gaining a more profound understanding and expertise. This approach can also lead to better career prospects, as students can develop a strong reputation in their field.In my opinion, a balanced approach is the most effective. While it is essential to have a broad knowledge base, it is equally important to allow students to pursue their passions and strengths. Schools can achieve this by offering a core curriculum that covers essential subjects, while also providing elective courses or specialisation streams. This way, students can gain a well-rounded education while also developing their interests and talents.In conclusion, both views have their merits, and a balanced approach is the key to providing students with the best possible education. By allowing students to learn a range of subjects while also pursuing their strengths and interests, we can foster a love of learning, promote academic achievement, and prepare students for success in their chosen fields.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;The increasing dominance of the English language has sparked concerns about the decline of lesser-known languages. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that the disadvantages of language decline outweigh the advantages.On the one hand, the spread of English has facilitated global communication, commerce, and education. It has become a lingua franca, enabling people from diverse linguistic backgrounds to interact and exchange ideas. English has also opened up opportunities for economic growth, cultural exchange, and access to information. Furthermore, it has become a crucial tool for international business, science, and technology.On the other hand, the decline of lesser-known languages has significant cultural, social, and economic implications. Language is an integral part of a community's identity, history, and heritage. When a language disappears, a part of the culture and traditions associated with it also vanish. This loss of linguistic diversity not only affects the speakers of the language but also the world at large, as each language contributes to the rich tapestry of human experience and knowledge.Moreover, language decline can lead to social and economic marginalization of communities that speak minority languages. It can also result in the loss of traditional knowledge, customs, and practices that are embedded in the language. In addition, the decline of linguistic diversity can have negative impacts on biodiversity, as indigenous languages often contain valuable knowledge about the natural environment and conservation.In conclusion, while the spread of English has brought many benefits, I believe that the disadvantages of language decline outweigh the advantages. It is essential to recognize the value of linguistic diversity and take steps to preserve and promote lesser-known languages. This can be achieved through language documentation, education, and community engagement. By doing so, we can ensure that the world's linguistic heritage is preserved for future generations.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";I somewhat agree that creative artists should be given the freedom to express their own ideas, but with certain limitations. On one hand, artistic freedom is essential for innovation, creativity, and self-expression. It allows artists to push boundaries, challenge societal norms, and bring forth new ideas that might not have been explored otherwise. Government restrictions can stifle this creativity, leading to a lack of diversity and originality in art.On the other hand, complete freedom without any restrictions can be problematic. Some art forms may be offensive, hurtful, or even promote hate speech, which can have serious consequences on individuals and society as a whole. For instance, art that glorifies violence, racism, or sexism can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to a toxic culture. In such cases, government restrictions can serve as a necessary check to prevent the spread of harmful ideologies.Moreover, artists often have a significant influence on their audience, and their work can shape public opinion and cultural values. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that their creative expressions do not harm or exploit vulnerable groups, such as children or minorities. Governments can play a role in setting guidelines and regulations to protect these groups while still allowing artists to express themselves freely.In conclusion, while artistic freedom is essential for creativity and self-expression, it is not absolute. Some government restrictions can be necessary to prevent harm, protect vulnerable groups, and maintain social cohesion. A balance between artistic freedom and responsible governance is necessary to ensure that creative artists can express themselves without causing harm to others. Ultimately, it is crucial to strike a balance between artistic expression and social responsibility.
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;The debate on whether children should be encouraged to compete or co-operate has sparked intense discussion among parents, educators, and psychologists. While some people believe that fostering a sense of competition in children is essential for their development, others argue that teaching children to co-operate rather than compete is more beneficial in the long run.On the one hand, encouraging competition in children can have several benefits. It can motivate them to strive for excellence, push their limits, and develop a strong work ethic. Competition can also teach children valuable skills such as resilience, adaptability, and sportsmanship. In a competitive environment, children learn to deal with failure, rejection, and criticism, which are essential life skills. Moreover, competition can prepare children for the real world, where they will inevitably face challenges and obstacles that require them to be competitive to succeed.On the other hand, teaching children to co-operate rather than compete can also have numerous advantages. Co-operation promotes teamwork, empathy, and mutual respect among children. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to value each other's strengths and weaknesses, and develop essential social skills such as communication, negotiation, and problem-solving. Co-operation also fosters a sense of community and social responsibility, which are vital for building a cohesive and harmonious society. Furthermore, co-operation can help children develop a more positive self-image, as they focus on collective achievements rather than individual success.In my opinion, a balanced approach that incorporates both competition and co-operation is the most effective way to raise children. While competition can drive children to achieve excellence, co-operation teaches them the value of teamwork and social responsibility. By striking a balance between these two approaches, children can develop a strong sense of self-motivation, as well as essential social skills that will benefit them throughout their lives. Ultimately, it is up to parents and educators to create an environment that encourages children to grow into well-rounded, confident, and socially responsible individuals.
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";The notion that capital punishment is essential to control violence in society is a widely debated topic. While some argue that the death penalty is necessary to ensure public safety and deter violent crimes, others contend that it is not an effective solution. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and argue that the statement is not entirely accurate.On one hand, it is true that the death penalty can serve as a deterrent to some individuals who might otherwise commit violent crimes. The fear of facing capital punishment may make them think twice before taking someone's life. Additionally, some proponents of capital punishment argue that it provides justice for the victims and their families, bringing a sense of closure and retribution.On the other hand, there are several reasons why capital punishment may not be effective in controlling violence. Firstly, research has shown that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to violent crimes. Many violent crimes are committed in the heat of the moment, or by individuals who do not consider the consequences of their actions. Secondly, the death penalty is often applied unfairly and disproportionately to certain groups, such as the poor and racial minorities. This undermines its legitimacy and raises concerns about its use as a tool for social control.Furthermore, many countries that have abolished the death penalty have not seen an increase in violent crimes. In fact, some have seen a decrease in crime rates. This suggests that other factors, such as education, poverty rates, and access to mental health services, may be more effective in reducing violence in society.In conclusion, while the death penalty may have some deterrent effect, it is not a reliable or effective solution to controlling violence in society. Other factors, such as addressing poverty and providing access to education and mental health services, are likely to be more effective in reducing violent crimes.
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;In several countries, taking a gap year between completing high school and commencing university studies has become a popular trend. This decision can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on young individuals. In this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of taking a gap year.On the one hand, taking a gap year can be advantageous for young people. Firstly, it provides them with an opportunity to gain real-world experience and develop essential skills, such as independence, self-reliance, and time management. Many young individuals choose to work or travel during this time, which can help them build confidence, learn new skills, and gain a fresh perspective on life. Moreover, taking a gap year can also give students a chance to recharge and refocus after completing high school, allowing them to approach their university studies with renewed energy and enthusiasm.On the other hand, there are also some disadvantages associated with taking a gap year. One major concern is that it can lead to a loss of momentum and motivation. Students who take a gap year may find it challenging to get back into the academic mindset, which can negatively impact their performance in university. Furthermore, taking a gap year can also result in a significant delay in completing one's degree, which can have long-term implications on career advancement and earning potential. Additionally, some students may also struggle with the financial burden of taking a gap year, as they may need to rely on personal savings or take on part-time jobs to support themselves.In conclusion, taking a gap year between finishing high school and starting university studies can have both positive and negative effects on young people. While it can provide valuable life experience and skills, it can also lead to a loss of momentum and motivation, as well as financial burden. Ultimately, the decision to take a gap year should be made carefully, considering individual circumstances and priorities.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";The increasing dependence on computers is a phenomenon that has revolutionized the way we live and work. Today, computers are ubiquitous in various sectors, including business, hospitals, crime detection, and even aviation. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that computers will play an even more integral role in our daily lives.In the future, computers will likely be used for a multitude of tasks that we can hardly imagine today. For instance, they will be used to manage and analyze the vast amounts of data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling smart cities and homes to become a reality. They will also be used in the field of medicine, where artificial intelligence and machine learning will help diagnose diseases more accurately and quickly than human doctors. Furthermore, computers will be used to develop autonomous vehicles, making transportation safer and more efficient.However, this increasing dependence on computers raises questions about whether it is a good thing or not. On one hand, computers have made our lives easier, faster, and more convenient. They have enabled global communication, e-commerce, and access to information, which have transformed the way we live and work. On the other hand, our reliance on computers makes us vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data breaches, and other forms of cyber-crime. Moreover, the automation of jobs may lead to unemployment and social unrest.In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly brought numerous benefits to our lives, we should be cautious of their limitations and potential risks. We need to be aware of the potential downsides of our increasing dependence on computers and take steps to mitigate them. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of computers are maximized while minimizing their negative consequences. Ultimately, a balanced approach to our use of computers will be essential in harnessing their full potential while preserving our well-being and security.
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;The issue of whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that equal representation is crucial for achieving gender parity, others contend that such a quota system could undermine the principles of meritocracy and academic excellence. In my opinion, I partially agree with the idea of accepting equal numbers of male and female students, but with certain caveats.On the one hand, accepting equal numbers of male and female students can help address the historical imbalance in many subjects, particularly in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). By actively promoting female participation, universities can tap into a vast pool of untapped talent and provide role models for future generations of women. This, in turn, can contribute to a more diverse and inclusive learning environment, which is essential for fostering creative problem-solving and innovation.On the other hand, I disagree with implementing rigid quotas that prioritize gender over merit. Universities should prioritize admitting students based on their academic potential, skills, and passion for the subject, regardless of their gender. Imposing equal representation quotas could lead to less qualified candidates being accepted, which would ultimately undermine the academic integrity of the institution.A more effective approach would be for universities to implement targeted outreach programs and scholarships to encourage female students to pursue underrepresented subjects. Additionally, providing a supportive environment and resources to help students from underrepresented groups succeed academically would also be beneficial. By striking a balance between promoting diversity and upholding academic excellence, universities can create a more inclusive and vibrant learning environment that benefits all students. In conclusion, while I agree that universities should strive for greater gender balance, I believe that this goal should be achieved through targeted initiatives rather than rigid quotas.
62;Do you agree or disagree with the statement: people will spend less time on cooking food;Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.;"The statement ""people will spend less time on cooking food"" is a reflection of the rapid changes taking place in modern society. With the increasing pace of life, advances in technology, and shifting priorities, I firmly agree that people will spend less time on cooking food.One of the primary reasons for this trend is the growing demand for convenience. Busy schedules and multiple responsibilities leave individuals with limited time for cooking. As a result, people are turning to quick and easy meal options, such as pre-packaged meals, takeout, and food delivery services. These alternatives save time and effort, making them an attractive choice for those with hectic lifestyles.Moreover, technological advancements have also contributed to the decline in cooking time. The rise of meal kit delivery services, microwaveable meals, and instant pots has simplified the cooking process. These innovations enable people to prepare meals quickly and efficiently, reducing the time spent in the kitchen.Additionally, changing social dynamics and cultural norms have also played a role in shaping people's cooking habits. With the growth of the gig economy and increasing urbanization, traditional meal times and cooking practices are no longer a priority. Many individuals are opting for flexible and convenient eating habits, which often involve minimal cooking.However, some might argue that cooking can be a therapeutic and enjoyable activity. While this may be true, the reality is that many people prioritize convenience and speed over the pleasure of cooking. Furthermore, with the rise of online recipe platforms and cooking tutorials, individuals can still explore and enjoy cooking without spending excessive time in the kitchen.In conclusion, I firmly believe that people will spend less time on cooking food. The desire for convenience, technological advancements, and shifting social dynamics all contribute to this trend. As society continues to evolve, it is likely that cooking habits will adapt to accommodate the demands of modern life."
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;The debate surrounding the benefits of traditional games versus modern games in developing children's skills has been ongoing. While some argue that traditional games offer more benefits, others claim that modern games are more effective. In my opinion, I agree to a certain extent that traditional games are more useful in developing children's skills.On one hand, traditional games have been a staple of childhood for centuries, providing children with a platform to develop essential life skills such as social interaction, teamwork, and problem-solving. Games like tag, hide and seek, and board games require children to interact with their peers, promoting communication, cooperation, and conflict resolution. These skills are vital for building strong relationships and achieving success in adulthood. Moreover, traditional games often require physical activity, promoting physical health and coordination.On the other hand, modern games, particularly video games, have their own set of benefits. They can enhance cognitive skills such as memory, attention, and processing speed. Some modern games also promote problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. However, excessive exposure to modern games can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, social isolation, and addiction. Furthermore, the violent and competitive nature of some modern games can have negative impacts on children's behavior and emotional well-being.While modern games have their advantages, I believe that traditional games offer a more holistic approach to skill development. They provide a balance of physical, social, and cognitive development, which is essential for children's overall growth. Traditional games are also often low-cost or no-cost, making them accessible to children from all backgrounds. In conclusion, while modern games have their benefits, I agree that traditional games are more useful in developing children's skills, providing a well-rounded approach to childhood development.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The debate about how governments should allocate their budget has been ongoing for years. While some people argue that funds should be prioritized for medical care and education, I disagree. Theaters and sports stadiums play a vital role in promoting cultural and social development, and their importance should not be overlooked.On one hand, investing in medical care and education is crucial for a nation's well-being. Access to quality healthcare and education are fundamental rights that every citizen should have. These services directly impact the quality of life, productivity, and economic growth of a country. However, I believe that theaters and sports stadiums are not mere luxuries, but rather essential components of a healthy and balanced society.Theaters and sports stadiums serve as community hubs, fostering social cohesion and a sense of belonging among citizens. They provide a platform for cultural expression, artistic innovation, and entertainment, which are essential for mental and emotional well-being. Furthermore, these venues also contribute to local economies, generating revenue and creating jobs.Moreover, investing in theaters and sports stadiums can have long-term benefits for education and healthcare. For instance, sports stadiums can promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles, which can help reduce the burden on healthcare systems. Similarly, theaters can provide a creative outlet for students, enhancing their cognitive and emotional development.In conclusion, while medical care and education are essential public services, I believe that theaters and sports stadiums should not be overlooked. A balanced budget that allocates funds for these cultural and social institutions is necessary for creating a well-rounded and prosperous society. By investing in theaters and sports stadiums, governments can promote cultural development, social cohesion, and economic growth, ultimately contributing to the overall well-being of their citizens.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;The notion that the advancement of technology inevitably leads to the decline of traditional skills and ways of life is a topic of ongoing debate. While it is true that technological progress can make certain skills and practices obsolete, I firmly believe that it is not pointless to try and preserve them.On one hand, technology has indeed led to the decline of many traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, the rise of automation and artificial intelligence has replaced many manual labor jobs, rendering the skills associated with them redundant. Moreover, the increased use of digital media has led to a decline in traditional craftsmanship, such as printing, pottery, and weaving.On the other hand, I strongly believe that it is essential to preserve traditional skills and ways of life for several reasons. Firstly, they are an integral part of a country's cultural heritage, providing a connection to its history and identity. Preserving traditional skills and ways of life ensures that future generations can appreciate and learn from their ancestors' experiences. Secondly, many traditional skills, such as farming, cooking, and craftsmanship, are not only useful but also provide a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that is often lacking in modern, technology-driven lives. Finally, preserving traditional skills and ways of life can also contribute to sustainable development, as many of these skills are environmentally friendly and promote self-sufficiency.In conclusion, while it is true that technological progress can lead to the decline of traditional skills and ways of life, I strongly disagree with the opinion that it is pointless to try and preserve them. Traditional skills and ways of life are an essential part of a country's cultural heritage, provide a sense of fulfillment, and contribute to sustainable development. Efforts should be made to preserve and promote these skills, ensuring their continuation for future generations.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";The question of whether creative artists should be given absolute freedom to express their ideas has sparked a heated debate in recent years. While some argue that government intervention is necessary to maintain social order and moral standards, others believe that artistic freedom is essential to foster creativity and innovation. In my opinion, I agree that creative artists should be given a considerable degree of freedom to express their ideas, but with some limitations.On the one hand, artistic freedom is crucial for creative expression and innovation. When artists are given the liberty to express themselves without fear of censorship or retribution, they are more likely to push boundaries and challenge societal norms, leading to the creation of groundbreaking and thought-provoking works. Moreover, artistic freedom allows artists to reflect the world around them, providing a unique perspective on social issues and sparking important discussions.On the other hand, I acknowledge that some restrictions may be necessary to prevent the spread of hate speech, obscenity, and other forms of expression that may be harmful to individuals or society. Governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens from harm, and some forms of artistic expression may indeed cross the line into incitement or exploitation. For instance, depictions of graphic violence or explicit content may not be suitable for all audiences, particularly children.In conclusion, while I believe that creative artists should be given a considerable degree of freedom to express their ideas, I also recognize that some restrictions may be necessary to maintain social order and protect citizens from harm. A balance between artistic freedom and responsible expression is essential, allowing artists to create innovative and thought-provoking works while also respecting the rights and sensitivities of others. Ultimately, the key is to find a balance that promotes creative expression while minimizing harm, and to ensure that any restrictions are fair, proportionate, and necessary.
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The debate on whether the government should regulate the amount of violence in the media to reduce violent crimes has sparked intense discussions among scholars, policymakers, and the general public. While some argue that government intervention is necessary to mitigate the negative impact of media violence on society, others believe that such control would infringe upon individual freedoms and creative expression. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and offer my opinion on the extent to which I agree or disagree with the notion.On the one hand, there is evidence to suggest that exposure to violent media can contribute to aggressive behavior and desensitize individuals to violence. Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to violent media can lead to increased aggression, decreased empathy, and a heightened tolerance for violence. Furthermore, numerous incidents of violent crimes have been linked to the perpetrators' fascination with violent media, such as video games or films. In this context, it is reasonable to argue that government regulation of media violence could help reduce the number of violent crimes by limiting the dissemination of violent content.On the other hand, excessive government control over media content could have unintended consequences, such as stifling creative freedom and curtailing the ability of artists to express themselves. The media plays a crucial role in reflecting and critiquing societal issues, including violence. Overregulation could result in the suppression of important social commentary and the promotion of a sanitized, unrealistic representation of the world. Moreover, the Internet and social media have made it increasingly difficult for governments to effectively control the flow of information, rendering regulation a potentially futile effort.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential benefits of government regulation in reducing violent crimes, I believe that such control should be exercised with caution and nuance. A balanced approach that takes into account the complexities of the issue and the potential consequences of regulation is necessary. Ultimately, a more effective solution may lie in promoting media literacy, encouraging responsible media consumption, and supporting initiatives that address the root causes of violence, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of education.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";The notion that increased opportunities for women have created more problems than they have solved is a contentious issue. While some individuals may argue that this is the case, I strongly disagree with this assertion.On the one hand, it is undeniable that the rise in opportunities for women has led to some challenges. For instance, the increasing number of women in the workforce has resulted in a greater burden of responsibilities, as many women are still expected to take on the majority of household and childcare duties. This can lead to stress, burnout, and a sense of guilt as women strive to balance their professional and personal lives.On the other hand, I firmly believe that the benefits of increased opportunities for women far outweigh the drawbacks. One of the most significant advantages is the economic empowerment of women. As women enter the workforce and gain financial independence, they are better equipped to make choices about their lives, including their education, career, and personal relationships. This, in turn, has led to a significant reduction in poverty and an improvement in living standards for women and their families.Furthermore, the increased representation of women in various fields has led to a more diverse and inclusive society. Women are now able to contribute their unique perspectives and skills to a wide range of industries, from science and technology to politics and the arts. This has enriched our communities and challenged traditional stereotypes and biases.In conclusion, while the rise in opportunities for women may have created some challenges, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. As women continue to break down barriers and challenge societal norms, they are creating a more equitable and inclusive world for all.
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";The issue of growing traffic and pollution problems has sparked debate on the most effective solutions. One approach that has gained attention is increasing the price of petrol. While this measure may seem straightforward, I only partially agree that it is the best way to address these issues.On the one hand, increasing petrol prices can be an effective deterrent to reduce the number of vehicles on the road, thereby decreasing congestion and pollution. When petrol becomes more expensive, people are more likely to opt for alternative modes of transportation, such as public transport, cycling, or carpooling. This can lead to a reduction in air pollution, as fewer vehicles emit harmful gases. Moreover, the revenue generated from higher petrol prices can be invested in developing cleaner transportation infrastructure, such as electric vehicle charging stations or bike lanes.On the other hand, simply increasing petrol prices may not be enough to address the root causes of traffic and pollution problems. It may disproportionately affect low-income households who rely on private vehicles for daily commutes, exacerbating social inequality. Furthermore, it may not address the issue of poorly planned urban development, inadequate public transportation, and inefficient traffic management.To complement price increases, other measures can be implemented. Improving public transportation systems, such as expanding bus and train networks, can provide affordable and efficient alternatives to private vehicles. Encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing can also reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Moreover, implementing congestion pricing schemes, where drivers pay a fee to enter certain areas, can effectively manage traffic flow. Investing in clean energy technologies, such as electric or hybrid vehicles, can also help reduce emissions.In conclusion, while increasing petrol prices can be a useful tool in addressing traffic and pollution issues, it is not a panacea. A more comprehensive approach that combines price increases with improvements in public transportation, carpooling schemes, congestion pricing, and investment in clean energy technologies is likely to be more effective in solving these growing problems.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The question of whether advertisements should be banned has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that advertisements are manipulative and have a negative impact on society, others believe that they play a vital role in the economy and provide valuable information to consumers. In my opinion, a complete ban on advertisements is not necessary, but stricter regulations should be put in place to limit their influence.On the one hand, advertisements can be seen as manipulative and deceptive. Many ads use tactics such as emotional appeals, false claims, and celebrity endorsements to influence consumer behavior. This can lead to unrealistic expectations, unhealthy habits, and a culture of materialism. For example, the tobacco industry has been known to use appealing imagery and misleading claims to lure young people into smoking. In such cases, stricter regulations are necessary to prevent the spread of misinformation and protect vulnerable individuals.On the other hand, advertisements play a crucial role in the economy by providing a platform for businesses to reach their target audience and promote their products. They also provide valuable information to consumers, allowing them to make informed decisions about the products they buy. Many advertisements also promote social causes, such as environmental awareness and public health campaigns. A complete ban on advertisements would stifle innovation, limit economic growth, and deprive consumers of essential information.In conclusion, while advertisements can have a negative impact on society, a complete ban is not the solution. Instead, stricter regulations should be put in place to limit the influence of manipulative and deceptive advertising. Advertisers should be held accountable for the claims they make, and efforts should be made to promote responsible and ethical advertising practices. By striking a balance between regulation and freedom, we can ensure that advertisements serve the public interest without compromising the integrity of the advertising industry.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;The fast-paced nature of modern life often leaves individuals feeling overwhelmed and stressed. In an effort to cope with these pressures, people have developed diverse ways to unwind and relax. While some prefer to bury their noses in a book, others find solace in physical activity or tending to their gardens. In my opinion, a combination of physical exercise, mindfulness practices, and creative pursuits is the most effective way to reduce stress.Regular physical exercise is a proven stress-reducer, releasing endorphins that boost mood and energy levels. Activities such as yoga, jogging, or swimming provide an outlet for pent-up emotions, allowing individuals to clear their minds and focus on the present moment. Moreover, exercise can be adapted to suit various lifestyles, whether it's a quick 30-minute workout or a leisurely walk during lunch breaks.Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, complement physical activity by training the mind to stay present and focused. These techniques can be incorporated into daily routines, even during short breaks, to calm the mind and reduce anxiety. For instance, a few minutes of mindfulness practice during a morning commute can set a positive tone for the rest of the day.Engaging in creative activities, such as painting, writing, or gardening, provides an additional stress-reducing outlet. These hobbies allow individuals to express themselves, tap into their imagination, and disconnect from the demands of daily life. For example, nurturing a garden can be a therapeutic way to connect with nature, while creating something beautiful and rewarding.In conclusion, a holistic approach to stress reduction, incorporating physical exercise, mindfulness practices, and creative pursuits, is the most effective way to manage the pressures of modern life. By combining these activities, individuals can develop a well-rounded coping mechanism, better equipping themselves to navigate life's challenges with greater ease and resilience.
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";The notion that images are becoming a more powerful means of communication than written words in the modern world is a topic of great debate. While images have indeed become increasingly influential in conveying information, I believe that the written word remains an equally important and effective means of communication.On the one hand, images possess a unique ability to captivate and engage audiences on a deeper level. The rise of social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, has led to the proliferation of visual content, allowing individuals to share experiences and ideas through photographs and videos. Moreover, images can transcend language barriers and cultural differences, making them a universal language that can be understood by people from diverse backgrounds.On the other hand, written words possess a level of nuance and complexity that images cannot match. Written language allows for precise articulation of thoughts, emotions, and ideas, providing a depth of understanding that images often cannot convey. Furthermore, written words can be easily recorded and preserved, making them a permanent record of history, whereas images can be fleeting and ephemeral.Moreover, in many professional fields, such as academia, law, and journalism, written words remain the primary means of communication. Research papers, legal documents, and news articles all rely heavily on written language to convey complex information and ideas.In conclusion, while images have undoubtedly become a powerful means of communication, I do not believe they have surpassed the written word in importance. Both images and written words have their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and the most effective means of communication is often a combination of both. Ultimately, the choice between images and written words depends on the context, purpose, and audience of the communication.
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;The debate surrounding the preservation of endangered languages has sparked intense discussion, with some advocating for government intervention and others deeming it a futile endeavour. On one hand, the argument for allocating public funds to save these languages is predicated on their cultural significance and the importance of linguistic diversity.Proponents of this view contend that languages are integral to a community's identity, history, and traditions. By supporting the preservation of these languages, governments can help safeguard the cultural heritage of the communities that speak them. Moreover, linguistic diversity is essential for the world's rich tapestry, and losing a language would be akin to losing a unique perspective on the world.On the other hand, those opposed to government intervention argue that the cost of preserving these languages would outweigh the benefits. They contend that the limited number of speakers and the impracticality of reviving a dying language make it a poor use of public funds. Furthermore, in an increasingly globalized world, the utility of preserving minority languages is questionable, as more widely spoken languages such as English often serve as a lingua franca.In my opinion, while the cost of preserving endangered languages is indeed a consideration, the cultural and historical significance of these languages far outweighs the financial burden. Moreover, governments can implement cost-effective measures, such as documentation, education, and community engagement, to support language preservation. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of governments to protect the cultural heritage of their citizens, including the preservation of endangered languages.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;The notion that arts and music do not contribute to the quality of life and that government funds should be allocated elsewhere is a contentious issue. While some may argue that arts and music are non-essential and do not warrant significant government investment, I strongly disagree.Firstly, arts and music play a vital role in shaping a nation's cultural identity and promoting social cohesion. They provide a platform for self-expression, creativity, and innovation, which are essential for fostering a sense of community and national pride. By investing in arts and music, governments can help preserve and promote their cultural heritage, which can have a positive impact on tourism, education, and social unity.Furthermore, arts and music have been shown to have a positive impact on mental and physical health. Research has demonstrated that engaging in creative activities, such as painting and playing music, can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, while also improving cognitive function and overall well-being. In addition, arts and music can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, which is essential for maintaining a good quality of life.Moreover, arts and music can also have economic benefits. A thriving arts and music scene can attract businesses, talent, and investment, which can contribute to local economic growth and development. Governments can also generate revenue through arts and music tourism, festivals, and events, which can create jobs and stimulate local economies.In conclusion, while some may argue that arts and music are non-essential, I firmly believe that they play a vital role in improving the quality of life. They promote social cohesion, cultural identity, and economic growth, while also having a positive impact on mental and physical health. Governments should continue to invest in arts and music, as they are essential for creating a vibrant, inclusive, and prosperous society.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;The debate over whether the government should pay for healthcare and education has been ongoing for years. On one hand, some people argue that it is the government's responsibility to provide these essential services to its citizens. They believe that every individual has the right to access quality healthcare and education, regardless of their financial situation. Proponents of this view argue that government-funded healthcare and education would lead to a healthier and more educated population, ultimately benefiting the economy and society as a whole.On the other hand, others claim that it is not the government's responsibility to pay for healthcare and education. They argue that individuals should be responsible for their own expenses, and that government intervention would lead to inefficiencies and bureaucratic waste. They also believe that the cost of providing these services would be too high, and would require significant tax increases, which could stifle economic growth.In my opinion, I believe that the government has a crucial role to play in providing healthcare and education. While it is true that individuals should take responsibility for their own expenses, the reality is that many people cannot afford healthcare and education on their own. Government-funded healthcare and education would ensure that everyone has access to these essential services, regardless of their financial situation. This would lead to a more equitable society, where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential. Additionally, investing in healthcare and education would have long-term benefits for the economy and society, such as a healthier and more skilled workforce.However, it is also important to acknowledge the concerns of those who argue that government intervention is not the solution. To address these concerns, the government could implement efficient and effective systems for delivering healthcare and education, and explore alternative funding models, such as public-private partnerships. Ultimately, I believe that the government has a responsibility to ensure that all citizens have access to quality healthcare and education, and that this is essential for building a fair and prosperous society.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;The existence of zoos has been a topic of debate for many years, with some people arguing that they should no longer exist in the 21st century. While I understand the concerns about keeping wild animals in man-made environments, I only partially agree with this opinion.On one hand, it is true that zoos cannot provide the same natural habitat and freedom that wild animals would experience in their natural environment. Many animals are kept in small enclosures, which can lead to stress, behavioral problems, and a lack of exercise. Moreover, the removal of animals from their natural habitats can disrupt the balance of ecosystems and cause harm to the animals themselves. Therefore, I agree that traditional zoos that prioritize entertainment over animal welfare should not exist.On the other hand, many modern zoos have evolved to focus on conservation, education, and research, rather than just entertainment. These zoos provide a safe and naturalistic environment for the animals, and many have breeding programs that help to increase the population of endangered species. They also play a crucial role in raising awareness about the importance of conservation and the impact of human activities on the environment. Furthermore, zoos can also provide a safe haven for animals that have been injured or orphaned in the wild and cannot survive on their own.In conclusion, while I agree that traditional zoos that prioritize entertainment over animal welfare should not exist, I believe that modern zoos that focus on conservation, education, and research can still play an important role in the 21st century. By providing a safe and naturalistic environment for the animals and promoting conservation and education, these zoos can make a positive contribution to the protection of wildlife and the environment.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;Industrialization and environmental degradation have long been perceived as interconnected concepts. As countries strive to improve their standard of living, they often prioritize economic growth over environmental sustainability. However, I disagree with the notion that environmental damage is an inevitable consequence of industrialization.On one hand, it is undeniable that rapid industrialization can lead to environmental degradation. The increased demand for resources, energy, and manufacturing processes can result in air and water pollution, deforestation, and climate change. The pursuit of economic growth can lead to the exploitation of natural resources, compromising the delicate balance of ecosystems.On the other hand, it is not a zero-sum game where economic progress must come at the expense of the environment. In recent years, many industrialized countries have implemented policies and technologies that mitigate the negative environmental impacts of industrialization. For instance, the use of renewable energy sources, sustainable practices, and eco-friendly technologies have become increasingly prevalent. These innovations demonstrate that economic growth and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive.Furthermore, some countries have successfully decoupled economic growth from environmental degradation. Sweden, for example, has implemented a carbon tax, invested in renewable energy, and promoted sustainable forestry practices. As a result, the country has achieved significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining a high standard of living.In conclusion, while industrialization can lead to environmental problems, it is not an inevitable consequence. With the implementation of sustainable practices, technologies, and policies, countries can achieve economic growth while minimizing environmental damage. It is imperative that governments, corporations, and individuals prioritize environmental sustainability to ensure a prosperous and environmentally conscious future.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;The debate surrounding the allocation of government funds between public services and the arts has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While some people argue that the government should prioritize spending on public services and facilities over the arts, I firmly disagree with this notion.On one hand, public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure are undoubtedly essential for the well-being and development of a nation. They provide fundamental necessities that cater to the basic needs of citizens. However, the arts play a vital role in enriching the cultural fabric of a society and fostering creativity, innovation, and diversity.The arts have the power to bring people together, promote social cohesion, and provide a platform for self-expression. They also contribute significantly to a country's economy through tourism, cultural events, and the sale of art pieces. In fact, many cities and towns rely heavily on their cultural attractions to draw in visitors and stimulate local businesses.Moreover, investing in the arts can have a positive impact on public services. For instance, art therapy has been proven to be an effective tool in mental health treatment, while music education has been shown to improve cognitive skills in children. By supporting the arts, the government can, in turn, enhance the effectiveness of its public services.In conclusion, while public services are crucial for a nation's development, I firmly believe that the government should not neglect the arts in its budget allocation. The arts are not a luxury, but a vital component of a society's identity and a powerful catalyst for economic and social growth. By striking a balance between public services and the arts, the government can create a more holistic and inclusive environment that benefits its citizens in multiple ways.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;The statement that animals should be free and not kept in zoos has been a topic of debate among animal rights activists and the general public for many years. I strongly agree with this statement, as keeping animals in zoos raises significant concerns regarding their welfare, natural behavior, and the purpose of their captivity.Firstly, keeping animals in zoos can be detrimental to their physical and mental health. Animals in zoos are often kept in enclosures that are a fraction of the size of their natural habitats, leading to stress, boredom, and a lack of stimulation. This can result in abnormal behaviors such as pacing, self-mutilation, and aggression. For example, a study on elephants in zoos found that they exhibited abnormal behaviors such as swaying and head-bobbing due to the lack of space and stimulation.Secondly, zoos fail to provide animals with the opportunity to exhibit their natural behaviors. In the wild, animals roam freely, hunt, and interact with their environment and other animals. In contrast, zoos provide a controlled and artificial environment that is far removed from the animals' natural habitats. This can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the animals' natural behaviors and their place in the ecosystem.Thirdly, the purpose of keeping animals in zoos is often questioned. While zoos claim to provide education and conservation benefits, these benefits can be achieved through alternative means such as documentaries, wildlife sanctuaries, and conservation efforts in the animals' natural habitats. In fact, many zoos have been criticized for prioritizing entertainment and profit over animal welfare and conservation.In conclusion, keeping animals in zoos raises significant concerns regarding their welfare, natural behavior, and the purpose of their captivity. I strongly believe that animals should be free and not kept in zoos, and that alternative means of education and conservation should be explored.
80;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, picture, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?;Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.;I largely agree that creative artists should be given the freedom to express their own ideas, but I also believe that there are certain limitations and responsibilities that come with this freedom. On one hand, art is a powerful medium for self-expression, social commentary, and cultural critique. Government restrictions on artistic freedom can stifle creativity, limit free speech, and prevent artists from challenging societal norms and conventions. By giving artists the freedom to express themselves, we allow them to push boundaries, experiment with new ideas, and create works that reflect the human experience in all its complexity.On the other hand, there are instances where government intervention is necessary to prevent harm to individuals or society. For example, hate speech, incitement to violence, and child exploitation are not acceptable forms of artistic expression. In such cases, governments have a responsibility to regulate and restrict artistic content that promotes harm or violence. Furthermore, artistic freedom must be balanced with respect for cultural sensitivities and community standards. Artists should be mindful of the impact of their work on different communities and avoid perpetuating stereotypes or causing offense.In conclusion, while I agree that creative artists should be given the freedom to express their own ideas, I also believe that this freedom is not absolute. Governments have a role to play in regulating artistic content that promotes harm or violence, and artists have a responsibility to be respectful of cultural sensitivities and community standards. Ultimately, artistic freedom is not a license to offend or harm, but a privilege to create, inspire, and challenge society in a responsible and respectful manner.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;Advertising is indeed an omnipresent aspect of modern life, permeating every sphere of our existence. The debate surrounding its impact on our lives has sparked intense discussion, with some hailing it as a positive influence and others condemning it as a negative force. In this essay, I will delve into both perspectives, present my own opinion, and provide examples to support my argument.On the one hand, advertising can be seen as a positive force. It informs us about new products and services, helping us make informed purchasing decisions. Advertising also plays a crucial role in promoting cultural and social values, such as equality and environmental awareness. For instance, advertisements for charitable organizations like the Red Cross and UNICEF raise awareness about pressing global issues and encourage donations. Moreover, advertising supports the economy by creating jobs and stimulating competition, which drives innovation and improves product quality.On the other hand, some argue that advertising has a negative impact on our lives. Critics contend that it creates unrealistic expectations, fosters materialism, and contributes to the exploitation of vulnerable groups, such as children. Furthermore, advertising can be seen as an invasion of privacy, with companies collecting personal data to target consumers with tailored ads. For example, the proliferation of online ads can be overwhelming, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine content and sponsored material.In my opinion, while advertising has its drawbacks, its benefits outweigh its negative consequences. Advertising is an integral part of modern capitalism, and when done responsibly, it can be a powerful tool for promoting positive values and supporting the economy. However, it is essential to regulate advertising to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable groups and protect consumer privacy. Ultimately, a balanced approach to advertising, which acknowledges both its benefits and drawbacks, is necessary to ensure that it serves the greater good.
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;The statement that nuclear power provides clean and cheap energy is a contentious issue, with both proponents and critics presenting valid arguments. While nuclear energy does offer some benefits, I disagree with the notion that its advantages outweigh the disadvantages.On the one hand, nuclear power generation does not emit greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which contribute to climate change. This makes it a cleaner source of energy compared to fossil fuels. Additionally, nuclear power plants can operate continuously, providing a reliable source of electricity. Nuclear energy is also relatively cheap, as the cost of fuel is lower compared to traditional fossil fuels.However, there are several significant disadvantages associated with nuclear power. Firstly, the risk of nuclear accidents, such as the Fukushima Daiichi disaster, poses a significant threat to human health and the environment. The consequences of such accidents can be devastating, with long-lasting effects on the surrounding ecosystem. Secondly, the disposal of nuclear waste remains a major challenge, as it remains radioactive for thousands of years. This poses a significant risk to future generations, as the waste requires specialized storage and disposal facilities.Furthermore, the high capital costs associated with building nuclear power plants can be prohibitively expensive. The construction of a nuclear power plant requires significant investment, which can be a barrier to entry for many countries. Moreover, the risk of nuclear proliferation, where nuclear technology is used to develop nuclear weapons, is a major concern.In conclusion, while nuclear power does offer some benefits, including clean energy production and low operating costs, the disadvantages associated with it cannot be ignored. The risks of nuclear accidents, waste disposal, and proliferation outweigh the advantages, making it a less desirable source of energy. As the world transitions to a more sustainable energy mix, it is essential to prioritize cleaner and safer alternatives, such as renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.
83;Some people argue that the government should give every unemployed person a mobile phone and should make sure they have access to the Internet. They believe this is the best way of using the public money to reduce the problem of unemployment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.;The idea of providing unemployed individuals with a mobile phone and internet access has sparked a debate about the most effective use of public funds to address unemployment. While some argue that this initiative can be a game-changer in the fight against unemployment, others are skeptical about its potential benefits. In my opinion, I partially agree with this proposition.On the one hand, having a mobile phone and internet access can undoubtedly open up new opportunities for job seekers. With a mobile phone, unemployed individuals can receive job alerts, stay connected with potential employers, and access online job portals. The internet, on the other hand, provides a vast array of resources, including online job boards, career guidance, and skill-enhancing courses. This can be particularly beneficial for those living in remote areas or with limited access to traditional job centers. Furthermore, in today's digital age, having a mobile phone and internet access is almost a prerequisite for job searching, and providing these resources can help level the playing field for disadvantaged individuals.On the other hand, I believe that simply providing a mobile phone and internet access is not enough to address the complex issue of unemployment. Many unemployed individuals face deeper structural barriers, such as lack of skills, education, or experience, which cannot be resolved by technology alone. Moreover, the cost of implementing and maintaining such a program could be substantial, and it is unclear whether the benefits would outweigh the costs. Governments could potentially use these funds more effectively by investing in vocational training programs, education initiatives, or entrepreneurship schemes that address the root causes of unemployment.In conclusion, while providing mobile phones and internet access to unemployed individuals can be a useful tool in the fight against unemployment, it should not be seen as a panacea. A more comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying causes of unemployment and provides a range of support services is likely to be more effective in the long run.
84;The use of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras in streets, stations, shops and other public places has increased rapidly in recent years. Although we are told that these cameras help in the fight against crime, some people are opposed to their use. They believe that everyone has a right to privacy. What are your views?;Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.;The proliferation of close-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in public places has been a topic of debate in recent years. While the primary purpose of these cameras is to aid in crime prevention and detection, a significant number of people have expressed concerns about their impact on individual privacy. In my opinion, the use of CCTV cameras in public areas is a necessary measure to ensure public safety, but it is equally important to establish strict guidelines to protect the right to privacy.On the one hand, CCTV cameras have proven to be effective in deterring and solving crimes. The presence of these cameras can make potential offenders think twice before committing a crime, as they know they are being watched. Furthermore, footage from CCTV cameras has been instrumental in identifying and apprehending culprits, thereby bringing criminals to justice. This, in turn, contributes to creating a safer environment for citizens.On the other hand, concerns about the erosion of privacy are valid and should not be dismissed. The widespread use of CCTV cameras can create a sense of surveillance, which can be unsettling for some individuals. Additionally, there is always a risk that the footage recorded by these cameras could be misused or accessed by unauthorized parties.To strike a balance between the need for public safety and the right to privacy, it is essential to implement and enforce strict regulations on the use of CCTV cameras. This includes ensuring that cameras are only installed in areas where they are necessary, that footage is stored securely and only accessed by authorized personnel, and that clear guidelines are established for the use of this technology. By doing so, we can harness the benefits of CCTV cameras while protecting the fundamental right to privacy.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;The debate about whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city has been ongoing for years. While some argue that the countryside offers a more peaceful and natural environment, others claim that cities provide better opportunities and experiences for children. In this essay, I will argue that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside.Growing up in the countryside offers children a unique opportunity to connect with nature and develop a sense of responsibility and self-sufficiency. The countryside provides ample space for children to explore, play and engage in outdoor activities, which is essential for their physical and mental development. In contrast, city children often spend most of their time indoors, glued to screens and lacking in physical activity. Furthermore, the countryside provides a safer and more secure environment for children to grow up in, with lower crime rates and less traffic congestion.In addition, the countryside offers a stronger sense of community and social connection. Children growing up in the countryside are more likely to develop close relationships with their neighbors and community members, which is essential for building social skills and a sense of belonging. In cities, children are often surrounded by strangers and may lack a sense of community and connection.However, some may argue that cities offer better opportunities for education and career advancement. While this may be true, I believe that the benefits of growing up in the countryside far outweigh the benefits of city life. Children growing up in the countryside can still access quality education and career opportunities through technology and online resources.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside. The countryside offers a unique combination of natural beauty, safety, community and opportunities for outdoor activity and exploration, making it an ideal place for children to grow and develop.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";The age-old debate about whether it is better to be an employee or an entrepreneur has been a longstanding topic of discussion. While some people prefer the security and stability of working for a company, others believe that going into business for themselves is the key to success. In my opinion, I think that being one's own boss is better, but only for certain individuals.On one hand, having a job in a company provides a sense of security and stability. Employees typically receive a steady income, benefits, and paid time off, which can be very appealing. Additionally, working for a company can provide valuable experience, skills, and networking opportunities that can be beneficial for career advancement. However, this setup can also be limiting, as employees may feel constrained by the company's rules and regulations, and may not have the freedom to pursue their own ideas and passions.On the other hand, being one's own boss can be incredibly liberating. Entrepreneurs have the freedom to pursue their own business ideas, work at their own pace, and create their own schedule. This can be especially beneficial for individuals who are creative, innovative, and self-motivated. However, being an entrepreneur also comes with its own set of challenges, such as financial instability, long working hours, and the responsibility of managing a business.Ultimately, whether it is better to work for a company or be one's own boss depends on the individual. Some people thrive in a structured work environment, while others prefer the freedom and autonomy of being their own boss. For those who are willing to take the risk, being an entrepreneur can be a highly rewarding experience, but for those who value stability and security, working for a company may be the better choice.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"The expression ""Never, never give up"" has become a powerful mantra in the pursuit of success, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and determination. The phrase, popularized by Winston Churchill, serves as a reminder that one should keep trying and never stop working towards their goal, no matter the obstacles or challenges that arise. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, as I believe that persistence and resilience are essential qualities for achieving success.Giving up on one's goals can be detrimental to personal growth and development. When faced with difficulties, it is easy to become discouraged and lose sight of one's objectives. However, it is precisely in these moments of adversity that one must draw upon their inner strength and resolve to push forward. By persisting in the face of challenges, individuals can develop a sense of determination and grit, which are essential for overcoming even the most daunting obstacles.Moreover, the act of giving up can lead to a sense of regret and ""what ifs,"" which can haunt individuals for years to come. On the other hand, persevering and continuing to work towards one's goals can lead to a sense of accomplishment and pride, regardless of the outcome. Even if one ultimately falls short of their objective, the lessons learned and experiences gained during the process can be invaluable.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the expression ""Never, never give up"" is a valuable mantra that should be adopted by individuals seeking to achieve their goals. By persisting in the face of adversity and continuing to work towards one's objectives, individuals can develop the resilience and determination necessary for success. By never giving up, individuals can ensure that they have done everything in their power to achieve their goals, and can ultimately look back on their efforts with a sense of pride and accomplishment."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;The debate over prioritizing human needs versus conservation of land for endangered animals has sparked intense discussion. While some individuals believe that human requirements for farmland, housing, and industry supersede the need to preserve land for endangered species, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint.First and foremost, the preservation of land for endangered animals is crucial for maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity. The loss of natural habitats can have severe consequences on the entire ecosystem, ultimately affecting human well-being. For instance, forests provide oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, and support a wide range of plant and animal species. By conserving land for endangered animals, we are also safeguarding the ecosystem services that humans rely on.Moreover, the idea that human needs and conservation are mutually exclusive is a false dichotomy. In reality, sustainable development and conservation can go hand-in-hand. For example, eco-tourism can generate income and create jobs while promoting the conservation of natural habitats. Similarly, sustainable agriculture practices can ensure food security while minimizing the impact on the environment.Furthermore, the preservation of land for endangered animals is not just a moral obligation, but also a long-term investment in human well-being. The loss of species can have severe economic and health consequences. For instance, the loss of pollinators can impact food production, while the loss of medicinal plants can limit our ability to develop new medicines.In conclusion, while human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are important, they should not come at the expense of conserving land for endangered animals. By adopting sustainable development practices and recognizing the intrinsic value of conservation, we can balance human needs with the need to preserve our planet's precious biodiversity.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";I agree with the statement that one should never judge a person by external appearance. This age-old adage still holds true today, as it is often the case that people's true nature and character are not reflected by their physical appearance.Throughout history, there have been numerous examples of individuals who were misjudged based on their external appearance. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most brilliant minds in history, was known to be sloppy in his dressing sense. However, his disheveled appearance did not deter him from revolutionizing the field of physics.Moreover, people from different cultural backgrounds often have distinct physical features and styles of dressing, which can be misconstrued as being inferior or superior to others. This can lead to stereotypes and prejudices that are far from the truth. A person's attire, skin color, or physical features do not define their intelligence, capabilities, or character.In addition, people's external appearance can change, but their true nature remains the same. For example, a person who is neatly dressed and well-groomed may still harbor malicious intentions, while a person with a shabby appearance may have a heart of gold. In conclusion, it is essential to look beyond the external appearance of a person to truly understand their nature and character. By doing so, we can avoid making incorrect judgments and treat people with the respect and dignity they deserve.
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;The debate surrounding the idea of a single international language has sparked intense discussions among linguists, cultural enthusiasts, and individuals from diverse backgrounds. On one hand, having a single international language could facilitate communication and collaboration across the globe, fostering global understanding and unity. English, for instance, has become a lingua franca, widely used in international business, education, and diplomacy. A single language could simplify interactions, enhance economic cooperation, and promote scientific exchange.On the other hand, I firmly believe that adopting a single international language would compromise the identity of cultures. Language is intricately tied to a community's history, traditions, and values, serving as a vital component of their heritage. Eradicating linguistic diversity would lead to the homogenization of cultures, diminishing the unique characteristics that make each culture distinct. The loss of a native language can be detrimental to a community's sense of self, leading to cultural assimilation and potential extinction of customs, rituals, and folklore.Furthermore, a single language would likely be imposed by a dominant culture, potentially marginalizing minority languages and their associated cultures. This could result in the suppression of indigenous voices, perspectives, and knowledge, ultimately contributing to cultural imperialism. Preserving linguistic diversity is essential for maintaining the richness and complexity of human experience.In conclusion, while a single international language might offer practical benefits, I firmly believe that it would come at the cost of cultural diversity and identity. Rather than adopting a single language, we should strive to promote multilingualism, encouraging individuals to learn and appreciate multiple languages. By embracing linguistic diversity, we can foster a more inclusive, tolerant, and culturally sensitive global community, where diverse voices and perspectives are valued and respected.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;The fast-paced world of fashion trends has led many to question their relevance and purpose. With the constant bombardment of new styles and must-haves, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and skeptical about the true intentions behind these trends. In my opinion, I partially agree that fashion trends are primarily designed to sell clothes, and that we should prioritize dressing in what makes us feel confident and comfortable.On one hand, it's undeniable that the fashion industry is a multi-billion dollar market, and designers and brands have a vested interest in creating trends that drive sales. The constant stream of new collections and limited-edition releases creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, encouraging consumers to buy now or miss out. This cycle of consumption can lead to a culture of disposability and waste, where garments are worn once or twice before being discarded.On the other hand, fashion trends can also serve as a form of self-expression and a way to connect with others who share similar tastes and styles. Many people enjoy staying on top of the latest trends as a way to showcase their personality and creativity. Moreover, fashion trends can also provide a sense of belonging and community, as people come together to celebrate and share their love of fashion.Ultimately, I believe that it's essential to strike a balance between staying informed about fashion trends and dressing in a way that feels authentic and comfortable. Rather than blindly following every trend, we should focus on developing our own personal style, which may incorporate elements of current trends, but also reflects our individuality. By doing so, we can break free from the pressure to keep up with the latest must-haves and focus on building a wardrobe that truly makes us feel confident and expressive.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";The question of whether wealthy nations should share their wealth among poorer nations is a complex and contentious issue. On one hand, it can be argued that wealthy nations have a moral obligation to provide aid and support to those in need, particularly in the areas of food and education. These basic necessities are essential for human development and dignity, and their lack can perpetuate poverty and inequality.On the other hand, some argue that it is the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves. They contend that relying on foreign aid can create dependency and undermine the ability of these nations to develop their own economies and social systems. Moreover, some wealthy nations may have their own domestic issues to prioritize, such as poverty and inequality within their own borders.However, I firmly believe that wealthy nations have a duty to provide assistance to those in need. The disparity between rich and poor nations is a pressing global issue, and the sharing of wealth can help alleviate poverty, improve living standards, and promote global stability. Providing food and education can have a profound impact on the development of individuals and communities, enabling them to break the cycle of poverty and participate in the global economy.Moreover, the benefits of sharing wealth extend beyond the recipient nations. By addressing global poverty and inequality, wealthy nations can also ensure their own economic and security interests. A more stable and prosperous world benefits everyone, and it is in the interests of wealthy nations to contribute to this goal.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that wealthy nations have a moral obligation to share their wealth with poorer nations, particularly in the areas of food and education. This assistance can have a transformative impact on individuals, communities, and nations, promoting global development, stability, and prosperity for all.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;The allocation of a country's health budget is a crucial decision that can have far-reaching consequences for its citizens. The statement suggests that a significant proportion of the health budget should be redirected from treatment to health education and preventative measures. I agree with this statement to a considerable extent.On one hand, treatment is essential for addressing the immediate healthcare needs of individuals, especially those suffering from life-threatening conditions or chronic illnesses. Hospitals and medical facilities require adequate funding to provide quality care, and reducing the budget for treatment could compromise the health and well-being of patients. Moreover, treatment is often the only viable option for certain health conditions, and cutting funds for treatment could lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates.On the other hand, investing in health education and preventative measures can have a profound impact on the overall health of the population. By educating citizens about healthy lifestyles, disease prevention, and early detection, the government can empower them to take control of their own health. Preventative measures such as vaccinations, screenings, and health check-ups can also help identify and address health issues before they become serious problems. This approach can lead to a reduction in the incidence of diseases, thereby decreasing the burden on the healthcare system and ultimately reducing healthcare costs.In conclusion, while both treatment and health education/preventative measures are crucial components of a country's health budget, I believe that a significant proportion of the budget should be allocated to health education and preventative measures. By investing in these areas, the government can promote a culture of health and wellness, reduce the incidence of diseases, and ultimately create a more sustainable and cost-effective healthcare system. However, it is essential to strike a balance between treatment and preventative measures to ensure that the healthcare needs of all citizens are addressed.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;The influence of news media on people's lives is a double-edged sword. While some argue that its increasing popularity has a profoundly negative impact, others see it as a vital source of information that keeps citizens informed and engaged. I firmly disagree that the popularity of news media is an entirely negative development.On the one hand, the proliferation of news media has created a culture of sensationalism, where ratings-driven journalism prioritizes shock value over fact-based reporting. This has led to the spread of misinformation, fueling anxiety, and fostering a sense of hopelessness. Moreover, the 24-hour news cycle can create a sense of perpetual crisis, contributing to a culture of fear and mistrust.On the other hand, a well-informed citizenry is essential for a functioning democracy. News media provides a vital service in holding those in power accountable, exposing corruption, and shedding light on social injustices. By providing a platform for diverse perspectives and opinions, news media fosters critical thinking, encourages public discourse, and promotes civic engagement.Furthermore, the rise of digital media has democratized access to information, allowing marginalized voices to be heard and amplifying the stories of those often ignored by mainstream outlets. This increased diversity of perspectives has enriched our understanding of the world and promoted empathy and tolerance.In conclusion, while there are legitimate concerns about the negative impacts of news media's popularity, its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. By promoting critical thinking, civic engagement, and a well-informed citizenry, news media plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy democracy. Rather than viewing its popularity as a negative development, we should strive to create a media landscape that prioritizes fact-based reporting, diverse perspectives, and nuanced analysis.
95;Under British and Australian laws, a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.First and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.Apart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.To conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.;The notion of withholding a defendant's past criminal record from a jury in a criminal case is a long-standing practice in British and Australian laws. This practice is designed to protect the accused from potential bias and ensure a fair trial. However, some lawyers have argued that this practice should be amended, and jurors should be provided with all relevant information, including the defendant's past criminal history. I disagree with this proposition.Granting jurors access to a defendant's past criminal record could lead to unfair prejudice and compromise the integrity of the trial. Jurors may be swayed by previous convictions, rather than focusing solely on the evidence presented in the current case. This could result in a miscarriage of justice, where the defendant is convicted based on past mistakes rather than the crime at hand. Moreover, it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, without relying on past misdeeds to influence the verdict.Furthermore, revealing a defendant's past criminal record could also infringe upon their right to privacy and the principle of rehabilitation. The justice system aims to rehabilitate offenders and reintegrate them into society. Disclosing past convictions could hinder this process and perpetuate a cycle of recidivism.On the other hand, it is the responsibility of the judge to ensure that the jury remains impartial and focused on the evidence. If there is a legitimate concern that a defendant's past record may be relevant to the case, the judge can exercise discretion and disclose the information accordingly.In conclusion, while the intention behind providing jurors with a defendant's past criminal record may be to ensure a more informed verdict, it is a risky proposition that could compromise the fairness of the trial. The current practice of withholding this information is designed to protect the accused and uphold the principles of justice.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;The notion that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way is a widely debated topic. While these events can bring people together and foster a sense of national pride, I partially agree with this statement, as their impact on international tensions is limited and can sometimes even exacerbate them.On the one hand, international sporting events like the World Cup can undoubtedly ease international tensions by providing a common platform for nations to engage with each other in a spirit of friendly competition. The shared excitement and enthusiasm for the games can transcend cultural and linguistic barriers, creating a sense of global unity. Moreover, these events can promote mutual understanding and respect between nations, as athletes and spectators alike are exposed to different cultures and traditions.On the other hand, the release of patriotic emotions during these events can sometimes tip into nationalism and xenophobia, particularly when teams are eliminated or lose to rival nations. This can lead to an escalation of tensions, as witnessed in cases of hooliganism and racist chants during matches. Furthermore, the intense media coverage and hype surrounding these events can also create unrealistic expectations and pressures on athletes, leading to increased stress and anxiety.In conclusion, while international sporting events can play a role in easing international tensions and promoting national pride, their impact should not be overstated. These events can also be a double-edged sword, highlighting the complexities of international relations and the challenges of managing national emotions. Ultimately, their success in fostering global unity and understanding depends on the ability of nations to approach these events with a spirit of sportsmanship, respect, and inclusivity.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;In many countries, the phenomenon of children engaging in paid work is a contentious issue that sparks intense debate among various stakeholders. While some people strongly believe that this practice is completely wrong, others consider it a valuable form of work experience that helps children learn and develop essential life skills. As a neutral observer, I will present my opinions on this matter.On one hand, engaging children in paid work can be detrimental to their physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. Children who work part-time or full-time often have to sacrifice their education, which is essential for their future success and personal growth. Moreover, they may be exposed to hazardous working conditions, long hours, and low wages, which can lead to exploitation and abuse. For instance, children working in factories or farms may be prone to injuries, while those working in the service industry may be subjected to verbal and physical abuse.On the other hand, some people argue that paid work can provide children with valuable work experience, teaching them important life skills such as responsibility, time management, and teamwork. For example, a part-time job can help a teenager develop a sense of accountability, as they learn to balance work and school commitments. Additionally, earning a salary can foster a sense of independence and self-reliance, as children learn to manage their finances and make smart spending decisions.In my opinion, the key to resolving this issue lies in finding a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of children engaging in paid work. Governments and policymakers should establish laws and regulations that protect children from exploitation and ensure their safety and well-being. Additionally, they should provide alternative programs and initiatives that offer children opportunities for work experience and skill-building, while also prioritizing their education and personal development. Ultimately, it is crucial to prioritize the needs and well-being of children, while also acknowledging the potential benefits of paid work in their lives.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;The trend of taking a gap year between high school and university studies has gained significant popularity in recent years. This practice allows young individuals to take a break from academics and pursue other interests such as work or travel. While this decision can have its benefits, it also comes with its drawbacks.On the one hand, taking a gap year can be highly beneficial for young people. One of the primary advantages is that it allows individuals to gain practical work experience, which can be valuable in their future careers. Many students who take a gap year choose to work in industries related to their desired field of study, thereby giving them a head start in understanding the real-world application of their skills. Additionally, traveling during this period can also broaden one's perspectives and foster independence, self-reliance, and adaptability. These traits are essential for success in both academics and professional life.On the other hand, there are also several disadvantages to consider. For instance, taking a gap year can disrupt the continuity of learning, potentially affecting a student's academic momentum and motivation. Some students may find it challenging to get back into the studying routine after a prolonged break, which could negatively impact their performance in university. Moreover, the financial burden of taking a gap year should not be underestimated. Unless students have secured well-paying jobs or scholarships, they may have to rely on their savings or parents' support, which can be a significant strain on family finances.In conclusion, whether or not to take a gap year between high school and university studies is a personal decision that depends on individual circumstances. While it can provide valuable work experience and personal growth, it also poses the risk of disrupting academic continuity and incurring financial burdens. Ultimately, students should carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages before making an informed decision.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;The notion that the qualities required for success cannot be learned at a university has sparked intense debate. While some argue that academic institutions are the primary breeding ground for success, others contend that the most essential qualities for success are acquired through real-world experiences and interactions. In this essay, I will argue that both perspectives hold merit, but ultimately, the extent to which I agree is limited.On one hand, academic institutions provide a foundation for success by equipping students with knowledge, critical thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities. Universities foster an environment that encourages intellectual curiosity, creativity, and analytical thinking. Students learn to navigate complex information, work collaboratively, and develop effective communication skills. Moreover, universities offer access to a network of peers, mentors, and professionals who can provide valuable guidance and support. These skills and connections are undeniably crucial for success in various fields.On the other hand, some essential qualities for success, such as adaptability, resilience, and emotional intelligence, are difficult to replicate in a classroom setting. Real-world experiences, internships, and apprenticeships offer invaluable opportunities for individuals to develop these skills. Moreover, qualities like leadership, entrepreneurship, and innovation often require a willingness to take risks, experiment, and learn from failures – experiences that may not be readily available within the confines of a university.However, it is essential to acknowledge that universities can provide a solid foundation for these skills to develop. For instance, many universities offer courses on entrepreneurship, leadership, and innovation, which can provide students with a theoretical understanding of these concepts. Furthermore, universities can facilitate connections with industry professionals, allowing students to learn from their experiences and gain practical insights.In conclusion, while I agree that some qualities required for success cannot be learned at a university, I also believe that academic institutions provide a crucial foundation for success. A balanced approach that combines academic learning with real-world experiences and interactions is likely the most effective way to cultivate the qualities needed to succeed in today's world.
100;People should be allowed to continue to work for as long as they want to, and not forced to retire at a particular age such as 60 or 65. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society. Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.First and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.Apart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.Admittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.In conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.;The traditional concept of retirement at a certain age has been a cornerstone of societal norms for decades. However, with the advancements in medicine and technology, people are living longer and remaining healthier well into their 60s and 70s. The question arises whether individuals should be allowed to continue working for as long as they want to, rather than being forced to retire at a specific age. In my opinion, I strongly agree that people should be given the freedom to choose when they retire.Forced retirement can be detrimental to individuals who are still capable and willing to contribute to the workforce. Many people find a sense of purpose and fulfillment in their careers, and being abruptly forced to stop working can lead to feelings of isolation and boredom. Moreover, the loss of social interactions and intellectual stimulation can have negative effects on their mental and physical health.On the other hand, allowing people to continue working can have numerous benefits for both the individual and society as a whole. Older workers can share their wealth of experience and knowledge with younger colleagues, providing valuable mentorship and guidance. Additionally, continuing to work can help individuals maintain a sense of identity and self-worth, while also contributing to their financial security.Furthermore, many countries are facing aging populations and labor shortages, and forcing retirement can exacerbate these issues. By allowing people to continue working, governments can tap into the valuable resource of experienced workers, while also reducing the burden on pension funds and social security systems.In conclusion, I firmly believe that people should be allowed to continue working for as long as they want to, rather than being forced to retire at a specific age. This approach can have numerous benefits for individuals, society, and the economy, and can help to promote a healthier and more productive aging population.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we experience and interact with historical objects and works of art. With the proliferation of high-quality digital images and online platforms, some people argue that public museums and art galleries are becoming obsolete. However, I firmly disagree with this assertion.While digital technology has undoubtedly made it possible to access a vast array of cultural and historical artifacts from the comfort of one's own home, it cannot replace the tangible, sensory experience of visiting a physical museum or gallery. There is something inherently valuable about being in the presence of an original work of art or historical object, surrounded by the atmosphere and context of a curated space. The textures, colors, and spatial relationships between objects cannot be fully replicated in a digital environment.Moreover, public museums and art galleries serve as important community hubs, fostering social interaction, education, and cultural enrichment. They provide a shared space for people to come together, engage in discussions, and learn from one another. The communal aspect of museum-going is an essential part of the experience, allowing visitors to connect with others who share similar interests and passions.Furthermore, museums and galleries play a crucial role in preserving and conserving cultural heritage for future generations. The physical artifacts themselves are often fragile and require specialized care to ensure their longevity. By housing these objects in a controlled environment, museums and galleries can guarantee their safety and accessibility for years to come.In conclusion, while digital technology has certainly expanded our access to cultural and historical artifacts, it is not a replacement for the real thing. Public museums and art galleries continue to hold significant value as community spaces, educational resources, and custodians of our shared cultural heritage. They will undoubtedly continue to evolve and adapt to the digital age, but their importance and relevance will endure.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;The practice of withholding a defendant's past criminal record from a jury in a criminal case has sparked intense debate. Under British and Australian laws, this practice is designed to protect the accused from potential bias and prejudice. However, some lawyers argue that a jury should have access to all relevant information, including a defendant's past record, to ensure a fair and informed verdict. In my opinion, I disagree with the proposal to change this practice.The primary concern with disclosing a defendant's past record is that it may unfairly influence the jury's decision. If a jury is aware of a defendant's previous convictions, they may be inclined to assume guilt based on past behavior rather than the evidence presented in the current case. This could lead to a miscarriage of justice, where an innocent person is wrongly convicted due to their previous record.Furthermore, the purpose of a trial is to determine guilt or innocence based on the evidence presented, not on the defendant's character or past actions. Allowing a jury to consider past records would shift the focus from the specific crime in question to the defendant's overall character, potentially leading to an unfair trial.On the other hand, proponents of the proposal argue that a jury should have access to all relevant information to make an informed decision. However, I believe that the benefits of withholding a defendant's past record outweigh the potential benefits of disclosure. By keeping this information from the jury, the court can ensure a fair and impartial trial, where the defendant is judged solely on the evidence presented.In conclusion, while the proposal to disclose a defendant's past record to a jury may seem appealing, I firmly believe that it is essential to maintain the current practice. By doing so, the court can protect the accused from potential bias and ensure a fair trial, where the focus remains on the evidence presented rather than the defendant's past actions.
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;The integration of the internet in formal education has been a topic of debate among scholars and educators. With the advent of online lectures, some argue that the importance of attending face-to-face lectures has diminished. While others believe that this trend has far-reaching benefits for academic study. In my opinion, the use of the internet in formal education is a positive development that has transformed the way students learn and engage with course material.On one hand, online lectures provide students with the flexibility to learn at their own pace and convenience. This is particularly beneficial for students who may have conflicting schedules or those who require more time to grasp complex concepts. Additionally, online lectures can reach a wider audience, making education more accessible and inclusive. The internet also offers a wealth of supplementary resources, such as online tutorials, educational videos, and interactive simulations, which can enhance the learning experience.On the other hand, some may argue that the absence of face-to-face interaction can hinder academic growth. However, I believe that the internet can also facilitate meaningful interactions between students and lecturers through online forums, discussion boards, and video conferencing. These tools enable students to ask questions, clarify doubts, and engage in peer-to-peer discussions, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.Moreover, the internet has the potential to revolutionize academic study by providing students with real-time access to information and resources. This can promote self-directed learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, which are essential for success in the digital age. Furthermore, online assessments and evaluations can provide instant feedback, enabling students to track their progress and adjust their learning strategies accordingly.In conclusion, the use of the internet in formal education has transformed the way students learn and engage with course material. While some may argue that face-to-face lectures are less important, I believe that the internet has opened up new avenues for learning, collaboration, and academic growth. As technology continues to evolve, it is crucial that educators harness its potential to create innovative and effective learning experiences that prepare students for success in the digital age.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;The issue of inaccessible medication in undeveloped countries is a pressing concern that warrants attention from the global community. Every year, countless lives are lost to curable diseases due to the unaffordability of life-saving medications. This raises a critical question: should drug companies in the developed world be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these countries?In my opinion, it is morally and ethically imperative that drug companies take a more proactive role in addressing this issue. By reducing the prices of their medications in undeveloped countries, these companies can help bridge the healthcare gap and prevent unnecessary deaths. This approach would not only be a humanitarian gesture but also a sound business strategy, as it would expand their market reach and potentially lead to increased sales volumes.Moreover, governments and international organizations can play a crucial role in facilitating this process. They can work with drug companies to establish tiered pricing models, where prices are adjusted according to a country's economic status. This would enable companies to maintain profitability while still making their products more accessible to those in need.However, it is also important to acknowledge the potential challenges and complexities involved in implementing such a system. Companies may need to absorb significant costs, and there may be concerns about maintaining profitability and investing in research and development. Nevertheless, the moral imperative to act is clear.Ultimately, making life-saving medications more accessible to those in need is a collective responsibility. By working together, we can create a more equitable and just global healthcare system where everyone has access to the treatments they need to survive.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;The debate over whether smoking should be prohibited in all public places has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While some argue that smoking is a personal choice, I firmly agree that governments and businesses should ban smoking in all public places.On one hand, banning smoking in public places can significantly reduce the risks associated with second-hand smoke. Passive smoking has been proven to be detrimental to one's health, causing respiratory problems and increasing the risk of lung cancer. By prohibiting smoking in public areas, governments and businesses can create a healthier environment for non-smokers and minimize the harm caused by tobacco smoke.On the other hand, some may argue that banning smoking in public places is an infringement on personal freedom. However, I would counter that the rights of non-smokers to a smoke-free environment far outweigh the rights of smokers to smoke wherever they please. Furthermore, governments and businesses have a responsibility to protect the health and well-being of their citizens and employees.Moreover, banning smoking in public places can also help to reduce the social acceptance of smoking and discourage young people from taking up the habit. Many countries have already implemented such bans, and the results have been encouraging. Studies have shown that smoking rates have decreased significantly in countries where smoking bans have been enforced.In conclusion, I strongly agree that governments and businesses should prohibit smoking in all public places. By doing so, we can create a healthier environment, reduce the risks associated with second-hand smoke, and discourage young people from smoking. While some may see this as an infringement on personal freedom, the benefits to public health far outweigh any perceived drawbacks.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";The relationship between human activities and the Earth's well-being has sparked intense debate. While some argue that we are improving the quality of life on our planet, I firmly believe that our actions are harming the Earth.On one hand, human innovations and technological advancements have undoubtedly improved the quality of life for many individuals. For instance, access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare has increased significantly over the past century, leading to a substantial rise in life expectancy and overall well-being. Moreover, sustainable practices such as renewable energy and eco-friendly infrastructure have become more prevalent, suggesting a shift towards a more environmentally conscious approach.However, I strongly disagree with the notion that these improvements outweigh the devastating impact of human activities on the planet. Climate change, deforestation, pollution, and species extinction are just a few examples of the irreversible damage caused by human actions. The relentless pursuit of economic growth and consumption has led to the depletion of natural resources, destruction of habitats, and disruption of delicate ecosystems.The alarming rate at which greenhouse gas emissions are rising, the melting of polar ice caps, and the staggering loss of biodiversity are all testaments to the harm inflicted upon the Earth. Furthermore, the consequences of these actions are far-reaching and have severe implications for future generations, from unpredictable weather patterns to decreased air and water quality.In conclusion, while human innovations have improved the quality of life in some aspects, the overwhelming evidence suggests that our activities are causing irreparable harm to the Earth. It is essential that we acknowledge this reality and work towards adopting sustainable practices, reducing our carbon footprint, and preserving the natural world for the benefit of all living beings.
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The issue of whether companies should encourage high-level employees older than 55 to retire has sparked intense debate. While some argue that this approach gives opportunities to new generations, others contend that it is unfair to push experienced workers out of their jobs. In my opinion, I disagree with the notion that companies should encourage older employees to retire.On the one hand, it is true that encouraging older employees to retire can create vacancies that younger workers can fill. This can bring new ideas, skills, and perspectives to the organization, which can be beneficial for its growth and development. Moreover, it can also lead to a more age-diverse workforce, where younger and older employees can learn from each other.On the other hand, I believe that age should not be a criterion for retirement. Many people over 55 are still highly skilled, motivated, and capable of contributing significantly to their organizations. Forcing them to retire can lead to a loss of expertise, experience, and institutional knowledge. Moreover, many older employees have spent decades building their careers and have earned the right to continue working if they so choose.Furthermore, in today's society, people are living longer and healthier lives, and many are capable of working well into their 60s and beyond. With the increasing retirement age and the need for people to work longer to support themselves financially, it is unfair to push older employees out of their jobs.In conclusion, while I understand the argument that encouraging older employees to retire can create opportunities for new generations, I believe that this approach is misguided. Instead of focusing on age, companies should focus on creating a work environment that values and supports employees of all ages, allowing them to contribute and grow throughout their careers.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;The debate surrounding the level of control over the media has been ongoing, with some advocating for stricter regulations and others pushing for greater freedom of expression. After careful consideration, I firmly believe that controls over the media should be loosened to give people freer access to information.On one hand, proponents of stricter control argue that it is necessary to prevent the spread of misinformation, protect national security, and maintain social order. While these concerns are valid, over-regulation can have unintended consequences. Excessive control can lead to censorship, stifling dissenting voices, and limiting the public's access to diverse perspectives. This can result in a lack of transparency, accountability, and ultimately, a less informed citizenry.On the other hand, loosening controls over the media can have numerous benefits. It allows for a more diverse range of viewpoints, fostering a more informed and engaged public. With greater access to information, citizens are better equipped to make informed decisions, participate in public discourse, and hold those in power accountable. Moreover, a free and independent media can serve as a watchdog, exposing corruption, and promoting good governance.It is also worth noting that the digital age has rendered traditional forms of control obsolete. With the internet, information can spread rapidly, regardless of geographical boundaries or government restrictions. Therefore, rather than trying to control the media, it is more productive to focus on promoting media literacy, critical thinking, and fact-based reporting.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the potential risks associated with a free media, I firmly believe that the benefits of loosening controls outweigh the drawbacks. By giving people freer access to information, we can promote a more informed, engaged, and participatory citizenry, ultimately leading to a more democratic and just society.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;The notion that paying taxes is sufficient to contribute to society has been a topic of debate among citizens. While some believe that fulfilling their tax obligations is enough to discharge their civic duties, others argue that being a responsible citizen entails more responsibilities. In my opinion, I firmly believe that being a citizen involves more responsibilities beyond paying taxes.Paying taxes is undoubtedly an essential aspect of citizenship, as it enables the government to provide public goods and services, such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare. However, this alone does not constitute active citizenship. Citizenship is not just about financial contributions, but also about participating in the democratic process, engaging with the community, and contributing to the well-being of society.Volunteering, community service, and civic engagement are essential aspects of responsible citizenship. These activities help build stronger, more cohesive communities, promote social welfare, and foster a sense of social responsibility. Moreover, active citizenship involves staying informed about local and national issues, participating in elections, and holding elected officials accountable. By doing so, citizens can influence policy decisions, ensure that their rights are protected, and promote the common good.Furthermore, being a responsible citizen also involves taking care of the environment, respecting the law, and promoting social justice. It requires individuals to be mindful of their actions and their impact on the community, and to take initiative to address social and environmental issues.In conclusion, while paying taxes is a necessary aspect of citizenship, it is not sufficient to discharge one's civic duties. Being a responsible citizen involves a broader range of activities, including community engagement, civic participation, and social responsibility. By recognizing and embracing these responsibilities, citizens can build stronger, more just, and more equitable societies. Ultimately, it is only by going beyond paying taxes that we can truly fulfill our obligations as citizens.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;The debate surrounding animal testing has sparked intense discussion among scientists, animal welfare advocates, and policymakers. While some argue that testing on animals is crucial for medical advancements, I firmly believe that it should be made illegal. The practice of animal testing raises significant ethical concerns, and alternative methods have become increasingly viable.One of the primary reasons animal testing should be banned is the immense suffering it inflicts on animals. Each year, millions of animals are subjected to painful and inhumane experiments, often resulting in severe physical and psychological trauma. This is morally unacceptable, as animals are sentient beings with feelings and rights. Moreover, the scientific community has acknowledged that animal models are not always reliable predictors of human outcomes, casting doubt on the effectiveness of animal testing.Fortunately, advancements in technology have led to the development of alternative testing methods, such as in vitro testing, computer simulations, and human clinical trials. These methods are not only more humane but also often more accurate and cost-effective than animal testing. For instance, human skin cells can be used to test the safety and efficacy of cosmetics, eliminating the need for animal testing.Furthermore, many countries have successfully implemented laws and regulations to restrict or ban animal testing, demonstrating that it is possible to balance scientific progress with animal welfare. For example, the European Union has banned animal testing for cosmetics, and many organizations, such as the Humane Society, are working tirelessly to promote cruelty-free testing.In conclusion, while some may argue that animal testing is essential for scientific progress, the suffering it causes and the availability of alternative methods make a compelling case for its abolition. It is our moral obligation to protect animals from harm and promote more humane and effective testing methods. Therefore, I strongly believe that testing on animals should be made illegal.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";"Many individuals question the efficacy of traditional ""pen and paper"" examinations as a means of evaluating academic success. In my opinion, I concur that these examinations are not the most effective method of assessing educational achievement.On the one hand, examinations have been a long-standing tradition in the educational system, providing a standardized means of evaluating students' knowledge and understanding of a particular subject. They enable teachers to gauge students' ability to recall information, think critically, and solve problems under timed conditions. Moreover, examinations serve as a motivation for students to study diligently and stay focused throughout the academic year.On the other hand, I believe that examinations have several drawbacks. Firstly, they can be a source of immense stress and anxiety for students, which can negatively impact their performance and overall well-being. Furthermore, examinations only assess a narrow range of skills, such as memorization and regurgitation of information, rather than evaluating students' creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, examinations do not account for individual differences in learning styles, and can be biased towards students who excel in written tests.In light of these limitations, I propose that alternative assessment methods, such as project-based evaluations, presentations, and peer reviews, should be integrated into the educational system. These methods not only provide a more comprehensive picture of students' abilities but also foster collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. Moreover, they enable teachers to assess students' progress throughout the academic year, rather than relying solely on a single examination.In conclusion, while examinations have their benefits, I firmly believe that they are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. By incorporating alternative assessment methods, we can create a more holistic and effective evaluation system that truly reflects students' knowledge, skills, and abilities."
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;The disparity between richer and poorer nations has long been a pressing concern globally. It is imperative that improvements in health, education, and trade are implemented to facilitate the development of poorer nations. However, the onus of responsibility should not solely lie on the governments of these nations. Instead, the governments of richer nations have a crucial role to play in providing assistance and support.Health, education, and trade are fundamental pillars of a nation's development. In poorer nations, inadequate healthcare systems, limited access to education, and restrictive trade policies hinder economic growth and perpetuate poverty. To address these issues, governments of richer nations can provide financial aid, technical expertise, and capacity-building programs. For instance, richer nations can contribute to global health initiatives, such as vaccine distribution programs, to combat infectious diseases. Similarly, they can offer scholarships, educational resources, and training programs to enhance human capital in poorer nations.Moreover, richer nations can facilitate trade by reducing tariffs, providing market access, and promoting foreign investment. This can enable poorer nations to diversify their economies, increase exports, and attract foreign capital. By doing so, richer nations can help create a more equitable global economy, where poorer nations can compete on a level playing field.Critics may argue that poorer nations should take ownership of their development and that external aid can create dependency. However, this perspective overlooks the historical and structural factors that have contributed to the wealth gap between nations. Richer nations have a moral obligation to acknowledge their past role in shaping global economic systems and to contribute to redressing these inequalities.In conclusion, while improvements in health, education, and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations, the governments of richer nations have a critical responsibility to provide support and assistance. By doing so, they can help create a more just and equitable global economy, where all nations have the opportunity to thrive.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;I strongly disagree with the notion that the increasing use of computers in education will soon render teachers obsolete in the classroom. While technology has undoubtedly transformed the learning landscape, offering unparalleled access to information and novel modes of instruction, the role of teachers remains indispensable.First and foremost, teaching is not merely about conveying information, but about fostering a deep understanding of complex concepts, encouraging critical thinking, and promoting analytical skills. Computers, no matter how sophisticated, lack the human touch and emotional intelligence that teachers bring to the learning process. They cannot replicate the nuanced feedback, guidance, and support that a teacher can offer, responding to the unique needs and abilities of each student.Furthermore, education is not just about academic achievement, but also about socialization, personal development, and character-building. Teachers play a vital role in shaping the social and emotional fabric of the classroom, promoting values such as empathy, cooperation, and respect. They help students navigate conflicts, build relationships, and develop essential life skills that are not programmable into a computer.Moreover, the integration of technology into the classroom requires teachers to be effective facilitators, able to harness the potential of digital tools to enhance learning outcomes. They must design engaging lesson plans, troubleshoot technical issues, and ensure that technology is used judiciously to support, rather than supplant, traditional teaching methods.In conclusion, while computers will undoubtedly continue to augment the educational experience, they will not replace the multifaceted role of teachers in the classroom. Effective teaching is a highly human endeavour that requires empathy, creativity, and adaptability – qualities that are unlikely to be replicated by technology alone. As we move forward, it is essential that we continue to value and support the dedicated professionals who make a tangible difference in the lives of their students.
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;The use of improved fertilizers and better machinery in food production has sparked a heated debate about the trade-offs between cost-effectiveness and the potential risks to human health and local communities. On one hand, it is undeniable that technological advancements in agriculture can lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs, making food more accessible and affordable for the masses. Improved fertilizers can enhance crop yields, while better machinery can streamline farming processes, reducing labor costs and increasing productivity.However, I strongly believe that the potential risks associated with these methods cannot be ignored. The use of synthetic fertilizers, for instance, has been linked to soil degradation, water pollution, and negative impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, the intensive farming practices that often accompany the use of these technologies can lead to the displacement of small-scale farmers and the exploitation of rural communities. The health risks associated with these methods are also a concern, as exposure to chemicals and pollutants can have severe consequences for human health.In my opinion, the pursuit of cheaper food production must be balanced with the need to protect human health and the well-being of local communities. This can be achieved by investing in sustainable agricultural practices that prioritize the use of organic fertilizers, crop rotation, and other environmentally friendly methods. Governments and regulatory agencies must also play a crucial role in ensuring that farming practices are safe and sustainable, and that the rights of local communities are protected.Ultimately, the true cost of food production must be calculated not just in terms of economic costs, but also in terms of the social and environmental impacts. By adopting a more holistic approach to food production, we can ensure that the benefits of improved fertilizers and machinery are realized without compromising the health and well-being of our communities.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;The role of government in supporting artists has long been a topic of debate. While some people believe that government should prioritize other important subjects, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, over helping artists, I firmly disagree. I believe that investing in the arts is crucial for a society's cultural and economic development.First and foremost, the arts play a vital role in shaping a nation's identity and culture. Artists, musicians, and writers are the custodians of a country's heritage, and their work reflects the values, traditions, and experiences of its people. By supporting artists, the government is, in effect, investing in the preservation and promotion of its cultural heritage. This, in turn, contributes to the development of a unique national identity, which is essential for fostering a sense of community and national pride.Furthermore, the arts have a significant impact on the economy. The creative industries, which include art, music, film, and literature, are a major source of employment and revenue. According to a recent study, the arts generate billions of dollars in revenue each year, supporting thousands of jobs and stimulating local economies. By investing in the arts, the government is, in fact, supporting small businesses, entrepreneurs, and local communities.Additionally, the arts have a profound impact on education and social cohesion. Arts programs in schools have been shown to improve academic performance, creativity, and critical thinking. Moreover, the arts bring people together, fostering social cohesion and understanding. In an increasingly fragmented world, the arts offer a universal language, which can bridge cultural and socio-economic divides.In conclusion, while it is true that there are many pressing issues that require government funding, I firmly believe that supporting artists is not a luxury, but a necessity. The arts are essential for a society's cultural, economic, and social development, and investing in them is a wise decision for any government.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The rapid development of technology has undoubtedly brought about numerous environmental problems, such as pollution, climate change, and depletion of natural resources. In response to these issues, two differing opinions have emerged: some advocate for a simpler way of life, while others believe that technology can provide the solution. In this essay, I will discuss both views and present my own opinion.On one hand, proponents of a simpler way of life argue that our reliance on technology has led to the degradation of the environment. They contend that a more basic, less materialistic lifestyle would reduce our carbon footprint, decrease energy consumption, and promote a more sustainable relationship with nature. This approach would encourage individuals to adopt practices such as recycling, composting, and reducing their use of single-use plastics. By embracing a simpler way of life, we would be able to mitigate the harm caused by our actions and live in greater harmony with the environment.On the other hand, others argue that technology can solve the environmental problems it has created. They believe that advancements in fields such as renewable energy, biotechnology, and sustainable materials can provide innovative solutions to the environmental challenges we face. For example, technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, while eco-friendly materials can replace plastic in packaging and other products. Furthermore, technology can facilitate sustainable practices, such as precision agriculture and smart grids, which can optimize resource use and reduce waste.In my opinion, while a simpler way of life may be beneficial in reducing our environmental impact, I believe that technology can play a significant role in solving the problems it has created. However, this requires a concerted effort to develop and implement sustainable technologies, as well as a shift in consumer behavior towards more eco-friendly practices. Ultimately, a combination of both approaches – embracing a simpler way of life and leveraging technology to support sustainable development – is likely to be the most effective way forward.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The debate over the compensation of professional athletes and entertainers has sparked intense discussion in recent years. Many argue that these individuals are paid excessively for their work, and upon closer examination, it's clear that this assertion holds merit.Professional athletes, particularly those in high-profile sports like football, basketball, and soccer, command astronomical salaries. For instance, top-tier football stars can earn upwards of $50 million annually, with some even signing contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are prime examples, with their annual salaries exceeding $70 million. While it's true that these athletes possess exceptional talent and dedication, their compensation far surpasses that of other high-skilled professionals, such as doctors and engineers.Similarly, entertainers like singers and actors also rake in exorbitant amounts of money. Pop stars like Taylor Swift and Kanye West can earn tens of millions of dollars from a single tour or album release. Meanwhile, A-list actors can command upwards of $20 million per film. The fact that these individuals can earn such enormous sums for performing a job that, while demanding, is also largely based on personal preference and entertainment value.When compared to other professions that contribute significantly more to society, the salaries of athletes and entertainers appear grossly disproportionate. Teachers, nurses, and social workers, for example, are often underpaid and overworked, yet they provide essential services that benefit the community as a whole. This stark contrast highlights the skewed value we place on entertainment and sports, leading to an uneven distribution of wealth.In conclusion, while athletes and entertainers undoubtedly possess remarkable talents and work diligently to hone their crafts, their compensation is indeed excessive. A more balanced approach to salary distribution, one that prioritizes essential professions and rewards talent in a more equitable manner, is necessary to rectify this disparity.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;"The role of computers and the internet in a child's education has sparked a heated debate in recent years. While some argue that these technological advancements are more crucial than traditional schooling, others firmly believe that schools and teachers are essential for effective learning. In this essay, we will discuss both perspectives and offer a personal opinion.On one hand, computers and the internet have undoubtedly revolutionized the way children learn. With an vast array of online resources and educational websites at their fingertips, children can access a wealth of information and learn at their own pace. Moreover, digital tools and software can make complex concepts more engaging and interactive, thus enhancing the learning experience. Proponents of this view also argue that with the rise of online learning platforms, children can access quality education from anywhere in the world, bridging geographical and socio-economic gaps.On the other hand, schools and teachers provide a structured and supportive environment that is vital for children's cognitive, social, and emotional development. Teachers offer guidance, feedback, and mentorship, helping children navigate through challenging subjects and build confidence in their abilities. Furthermore, schools foster socialization, teamwork, and communication skills, which are essential for success in all areas of life. Critics of the ""computers-only"" approach also point out that excessive screen time can have negative effects on children's physical and mental health.In my opinion, while computers and the internet are valuable tools that can certainly supplement a child's education, they cannot replace the benefits of traditional schooling. Schools and teachers provide a holistic learning experience that goes beyond mere academics. Children need human interaction, socialization, and emotional support to grow into well-rounded individuals. Therefore, a balanced approach that incorporates both technology and traditional teaching methods is likely to yield the best results."
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";The debate on whether capital punishment is necessary to control violent crimes in society has been ongoing for years. While some argue that it serves as a deterrent and helps to reduce crime rates, others claim that it is an inhumane and ineffective method of punishment. In my opinion, I disagree that capital punishment is necessary to control violent crimes in society.First and foremost, numerous studies have shown that there is no conclusive evidence to prove that capital punishment is an effective deterrent against violent crimes. In fact, many countries that have abolished the death penalty have seen a decrease in crime rates over the years. This suggests that other factors, such as socioeconomic conditions, education, and law enforcement, play a more significant role in determining crime rates.Moreover, capital punishment is a form of state-sanctioned violence that can lead to the execution of innocent people. With the advent of DNA technology, many wrongly convicted individuals have been exonerated, highlighting the fallibility of the justice system. The risk of executing an innocent person is a moral and ethical concern that cannot be ignored.Furthermore, capital punishment is often applied unfairly and disproportionately to certain groups, such as racial minorities and the poor. This raises concerns about the fairness and equality of the justice system, and whether the death penalty is being used as a tool of oppression.In conclusion, while the idea of using capital punishment to control violent crimes may seem appealing, it is not supported by evidence and raises significant moral and ethical concerns. Instead of relying on the death penalty, societies should focus on addressing the root causes of crime, such as poverty and lack of education, and implementing fair and effective justice systems that prioritize rehabilitation and restorative justice.
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;I disagree with the statement that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. While generating profit is a primary goal of any business, it should not come at the expense of ethics, social responsibility, and environmental sustainability.When businesses prioritize profits over everything else, they can engage in practices that harm the environment, exploit their employees, and deceive their customers. This can lead to long-term consequences that ultimately damage the business's reputation and sustainability. For instance, companies that neglect environmental concerns may face costly lawsuits, fines, and damage to their brand image. Moreover, companies that treat their employees poorly may struggle with high turnover rates, low productivity, and decreased employee morale.Furthermore, prioritizing profits over social responsibility can also harm the community and society as a whole. Companies that engage in predatory practices, such as price gouging or false advertising, can take advantage of vulnerable consumers and undermine trust in the market. In contrast, businesses that prioritize social responsibility and sustainability are more likely to build strong relationships with their customers, employees, and the wider community.In conclusion, while generating profit is essential for business success, it should not be the only consideration. Businesses should strive to balance their financial goals with social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and ethical practices. By doing so, they can build a positive reputation, foster strong relationships with stakeholders, and contribute to the well-being of the community. Ultimately, responsible business practices are not only good for society but also beneficial for the long-term success and sustainability of the business itself.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;The recent announcement of a potential new high school in our neighborhood has sparked a heated debate among residents. As a concerned citizen and student, I have given considerable thought to this proposal, and after weighing the pros and cons, I firmly support the plan.First and foremost, a new high school would provide a much-needed solution to the existing overcrowding issue in our current schools. With a growing population in our neighborhood, it is essential that we have sufficient educational infrastructure to cater to the increasing number of students. A new high school would not only alleviate the pressure on our existing schools but also offer a better learning environment for students, with smaller class sizes and more resources.Furthermore, a new high school would also have a positive impact on our community. It would create new job opportunities for teachers, staff, and administrative personnel, contributing to the local economy. Additionally, the school would provide a hub for community activities, such as sports events, concerts, and other cultural programs, fostering a sense of community and social cohesion.Some may argue that the construction of a new high school would lead to increased traffic and noise pollution in the area. However, I believe that these concerns can be mitigated through careful planning and design. The school can be designed with environmental sustainability in mind, incorporating green spaces and energy-efficient features.In conclusion, I strongly support the plan to build a new high school in our neighborhood. It would provide a vital solution to our current educational infrastructure challenges, create new opportunities for our community, and contribute to the overall well-being of our residents. I believe that with careful planning and consideration, this project can be a valuable addition to our neighborhood, benefiting both current and future generations.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;As teenagers navigate the challenging phase of adolescence, the question of who should make important decisions for them arises. While some argue that parents or adult relatives should make significant decisions for their 15-18 year old children, I strongly disagree with this statement.At the age of 15-18, teenagers are developing their sense of identity, autonomy, and independence. They are learning to take responsibility for their actions and are beginning to form their own opinions and values. Making important decisions for them would undermine this process and hinder their growth into capable young adults. By allowing teenagers to make their own decisions, they are able to develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and learn from their mistakes.Furthermore, teenagers are better equipped to understand their own needs, interests, and goals than their parents or relatives. They are more likely to make decisions that align with their own aspirations and values, rather than those imposed upon them by others. For instance, choosing a college major or career path requires a deep understanding of one's own strengths, passions, and interests. By allowing teenagers to make these decisions, they are more likely to pursue a path that brings them fulfillment and success.While it is true that teenagers may make mistakes or poor decisions, this is an inevitable part of the learning process. Parents and relatives can provide guidance, support, and wisdom to help teenagers make informed decisions, but ultimately, the decision-making power should rest with the teenager themselves. By doing so, we empower them to take ownership of their choices, learn from their experiences, and develop into confident, self-assured individuals.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;"The statement that ""Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life"" is a widely debated topic among people. While some believe that childhood is indeed the happiest phase of life, others disagree, citing various reasons to support their argument. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement.On one hand, childhood is a time of innocence, curiosity, and wonder. Children are free from the burdens and responsibilities that come with adulthood, allowing them to enjoy life without worrying about the pressures of daily life. They are surrounded by loving family members and caregivers who provide for their needs, making them feel secure and happy. Additionally, children's imagination and creativity are at their peak during this stage, enabling them to explore and experience the world around them with fresh eyes. These factors contribute to the happiness and carefree nature of childhood.On the other hand, I disagree with the statement because happiness is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. Many children face difficulties and challenges during their childhood, such as poverty, abuse, or neglect, which can greatly impact their happiness. Moreover, as children grow and develop, they begin to face various forms of competition, peer pressure, and academic expectations, which can lead to stress and anxiety. These experiences can make childhood not as happy as it is often portrayed.In conclusion, while childhood can be a happy time for many people, it is not universally the happiest time of a person's life. Happiness is a complex and multi-faceted concept that depends on individual experiences and circumstances. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement about childhood being the happiest time of a person's life."
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;Attending college and university is a significant milestone in an individual's life, and people do so for a variety of reasons. In my opinion, the primary reasons people attend college and university are to acquire specialized knowledge, enhance their career prospects, and develop personal growth.Firstly, institutions of higher learning offer students the opportunity to gain specialized knowledge in their chosen field of study. Colleges and universities employ experienced professors and researchers who impart their expertise to students, enabling them to develop a deeper understanding of their subject area. For instance, a student pursuing a degree in engineering will gain hands-on experience in designing and developing innovative solutions, preparing them for a career in the field. This specialized knowledge not only enhances their skills but also makes them more competitive in the job market.Secondly, attending college and university significantly improves one's career prospects. Many employers require or prefer candidates with a college degree, especially for positions that require specialized skills or knowledge. A degree from a reputable institution is often seen as a benchmark of a candidate's commitment, discipline, and expertise. Moreover, colleges and universities provide students with opportunities to network with peers and professionals in their field, potentially leading to valuable connections and job opportunities.Lastly, attending college and university is also a catalyst for personal growth. Students are exposed to diverse perspectives, ideas, and cultures, broadening their understanding of the world and helping them develop important life skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork. For example, participating in extracurricular activities, such as debate clubs or volunteer work, can help students develop their communication and leadership skills, making them more confident and self-assured individuals.In conclusion, people attend college and university for a multitude of reasons, including acquiring specialized knowledge, enhancing their career prospects, and fostering personal growth. These institutions provide students with the tools and experiences necessary to succeed in their chosen careers and become well-rounded individuals.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;The age-old debate about the ideal number and depth of friendships has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that having a large number of casual acquaintances is the key to a fulfilling social life, I firmly believe that having one or two close friends is far more beneficial.First and foremost, close friendships offer a depth and intimacy that is impossible to achieve with a large number of acquaintances. With a smaller, more exclusive circle of friends, individuals can engage in meaningful and substantial conversations, sharing their thoughts, feelings, and experiences without fear of judgment. This level of trust and understanding fosters a sense of belonging and security, allowing individuals to feel truly seen and heard.In contrast, casual acquaintances often lack this depth, with interactions limited to superficial small talk and surface-level conversations. While having a large number of acquaintances may provide a sense of social validation, it can also lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection. With so many people to keep up with, it's easy to feel like just another face in the crowd, rather than a valued and cherished friend.Furthermore, close friendships have been shown to have a positive impact on both mental and physical health. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with close, supportive relationships tend to have lower stress levels, healthier habits, and increased longevity. In contrast, a large number of casual acquaintances can actually have a negative impact on mental health, leading to feelings of anxiety and overwhelm.In conclusion, while having a large number of casual acquaintances may seem appealing, I firmly believe that having one or two close friends is far more beneficial. The depth, intimacy, and sense of belonging that come with close friendships are essential for our emotional and mental well-being.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";I wholeheartedly agree with the statement that life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when our grandparents were children. This assertion is supported by numerous significant advancements in various aspects of life, making it more convenient and enjoyable for people today.First and foremost, technological progress has revolutionized the way we live. The invention of the internet, smartphones, and various gadgets has simplified communication, access to information, and daily tasks. For instance, online shopping and food delivery services have reduced the need for physical presence, saving time and effort. In contrast, our grandparents had to rely on physical stores, letters, and face-to-face conversations, which were time-consuming and laborious.Another crucial aspect is healthcare. Modern medicine has made tremendous strides, providing effective treatments and cures for various diseases that were previously life-threatening. Vaccinations, antibiotics, and advanced medical equipment have significantly increased life expectancy and improved the quality of life. In the past, our grandparents had limited access to healthcare facilities, and many diseases were untreatable, leading to high mortality rates.Furthermore, improvements in transportation have also contributed to a more comfortable life. With the invention of cars, airplanes, and high-speed trains, traveling has become faster, safer, and more accessible. Our grandparents had to rely on bicycles, horses, or walking, which were time-consuming and physically demanding.In conclusion, the numerous advancements in technology, healthcare, and transportation have made life today easier and more comfortable compared to when our grandparents were children. While there are still challenges and inequalities in society, the overall quality of life has improved significantly, and we should appreciate and make the most of these opportunities.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;I agree that high school should allow students to study the courses that they want to study. High school is a crucial period in a student's life where they are discovering their interests and strengths. By allowing students to choose their courses, they can explore their passions and develop a deeper understanding of the subjects that they are interested in.Moreover, giving students the autonomy to choose their courses can lead to increased motivation and engagement in their studies. When students are studying subjects that they are genuinely interested in, they are more likely to be enthusiastic about learning and participate actively in class. This can lead to better academic performance and a more positive learning experience.Furthermore, allowing students to choose their courses can also help them develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. By selecting courses that align with their interests and strengths, students are able to take ownership of their learning and make informed decisions about their academic path.In addition, offering elective courses can also provide students with the opportunity to explore different career paths and interests. For example, a student who is interested in pursuing a career in engineering can take advanced math and science courses, while a student who is interested in the arts can take music or drama classes.However, some may argue that allowing students to choose their courses can lead to an unbalanced curriculum and a lack of exposure to important core subjects. But, I believe that a balanced curriculum can still be achieved by offering a range of core subjects and allowing students to choose from a selection of elective courses.In conclusion, I firmly believe that high school should allow students to study the courses that they want to study. By giving students the autonomy to choose their courses, they can explore their interests, develop important skills, and take ownership of their learning.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";The world is divided into two kinds of people: those who rush through life and those who savor every moment. As someone who has always been drawn to the latter category, I strongly believe that living life at a slower pace is not only more enjoyable but also more fulfilling.On the one hand, people who are always in a hurry may argue that they are more productive and achieve more in less time. However, in their quest for efficiency, they often sacrifice their mental and physical well-being. They are more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and burnout, which can ultimately lead to decreased productivity and a lower quality of life. In contrast, taking one's time allows for a more mindful approach to tasks, enabling individuals to focus on the process rather than just the outcome.On the other hand, living life at a slower pace has numerous benefits. For one, it allows for greater appreciation and enjoyment of the world around us. When we rush through life, we often overlook the small, yet significant, details that make it rich and meaningful. By slowing down, we can take in the beauty of nature, engage in meaningful conversations, and develop deeper connections with others. For instance, I recall a recent walk in the park, where I stumbled upon a group of musicians playing soulful music. Had I been in a hurry, I would have missed the opportunity to stop, listen, and connect with the artists.Furthermore, a slower pace of life fosters creativity, reflection, and personal growth. When we are not rushed, we have the time and space to think, reflect, and explore our interests. This, in turn, can lead to new ideas, skills, and perspectives that can enrich our lives and the lives of those around us.In conclusion, while some people may prefer the fast lane, I firmly believe that living life at a slower pace is the way to go. Not only does it promote mental and physical well-being, but it also allows for greater appreciation, creativity, and personal growth.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;Tourism, a multibillion-dollar industry, has become a crucial driver of economic development worldwide. On one hand, it generates massive revenue and creates employment opportunities for local communities. However, on the other hand, there is a growing concern that tourism causes irreparable damage to the local environment and culture. In my opinion, the negative impacts of tourism outweigh its economic benefits.One of the most significant environmental concerns associated with tourism is the degradation of natural habitats. The influx of tourists leads to pollution, soil erosion, and destruction of wildlife habitats. For instance, the coral reefs in Thailand's Phuket Island have been severely damaged due to the large number of tourists visiting the area. Moreover, the increasing demand for accommodation and amenities has led to the destruction of natural ecosystems, such as mangrove forests and sand dunes, to make way for resorts and hotels.Furthermore, tourism also has a profound impact on local cultures. The commercialization of cultural heritage sites and traditions has led to the loss of authenticity and cultural homogenization. Local communities are often forced to adapt to the demands of tourists, leading to the erosion of their unique cultural identities. For example, the island of Bali in Indonesia has seen a significant increase in cultural events and festivals being organized solely for the purpose of attracting tourists, rather than for the local community.In conclusion, while tourism does contribute to economic development, its environmental and cultural costs cannot be ignored. It is essential for governments and local authorities to implement sustainable tourism practices that prioritize environmental conservation and cultural preservation. By doing so, we can ensure that tourism benefits both the local economy and the environment, rather than causing irreparable damage.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;"The allocation of government funds is a perennial topic of debate. Some argue that the government should prioritize public services over arts, while others believe that arts are an integral part of society and deserve equal funding. In my opinion, I disagree with the statement that the government should allocate more funds to public services at the expense of arts.Firstly, arts play a vital role in promoting cultural diversity and national identity. Music, painting, and other forms of art are essential in preserving our heritage and showcasing our unique perspective to the world. By funding arts, the government is, in fact, investing in the country's cultural capital, which can lead to significant economic benefits through tourism and cultural exchange.Secondly, arts have a profound impact on our well-being and mental health. Studies have shown that engaging with art can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. In an era where mental health is increasingly becoming a concern, it is crucial that the government allocates sufficient funds to support arts programs that promote emotional well-being.Thirdly, arts are not mutually exclusive with public services. In fact, many public services, such as education and healthcare, can greatly benefit from the integration of arts. For instance, art therapy is increasingly being used in hospitals and schools to improve patient outcomes and student engagement.Finally, it is short-sighted to view arts as a ""waste"" of money. Arts contribute to the economy, create jobs, and stimulate innovation. In fact, many countries that have invested heavily in arts, such as Singapore and Denmark, have seen significant economic growth and cultural revitalization.In conclusion, while public services are undoubtedly essential, I firmly believe that arts are equally important and deserve sufficient funding. Rather than pitting arts against public services, the government should strive to find a balance that allocates funds to both, recognizing the intrinsic value of arts in promoting cultural diversity, well-being, and economic growth."
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";"The notion of having a single career is rapidly becoming a relic of the past. In today's fast-paced, ever-evolving world, individuals are no longer confined to one profession or source of income. The concept of having multiple careers or ways of earning a living is gaining traction, and it is likely that this trend will continue to shape the future of work.With the rise of the gig economy, automation, and artificial intelligence, the job market is undergoing a significant transformation. Many industries are becoming obsolete, and new ones are emerging, creating a need for workers to adapt and acquire new skills. Having multiple careers or sources of income will become essential for individuals to remain relevant and competitive in the job market.Furthermore, the idea of lifelong learning is becoming increasingly important. With technological advancements happening at an unprecedented rate, workers will need to continually update their skills to remain employable. This will require a shift in mindset, where education is no longer seen as a one-time event, but rather a continuous process that spans a lifetime.Having multiple careers or sources of income will also provide individuals with a sense of security and stability. No longer will people be reliant on a single job or income source; instead, they will have a diversified portfolio of skills and revenue streams. This will enable them to navigate the uncertainties of the job market with greater ease and confidence.In conclusion, the idea of having a single career is indeed becoming outdated. The future of work will be characterized by multiple careers, continuous learning, and a diverse range of income sources. As we move forward, it is essential that we embrace this shift and adapt to the changing landscape of work. By doing so, we can ensure that we remain relevant, employable, and equipped to thrive in a rapidly evolving world."
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;The role of computers in modern society has been a topic of debate among individuals. Some people believe that computers are a hindrance, while others see them as indispensable tools. In this essay, we will discuss both opinions and provide a conclusion based on the analysis.On one hand, some people argue that computers are more of a hindrance than a help. They believe that computers have led to a sedentary lifestyle, with many people spending most of their time sitting in front of a screen. This has resulted in various health problems, such as obesity, eye strain, and poor posture. Moreover, computers have also led to social isolation, with people relying more on digital communication and less on face-to-face interaction. For instance, social media platforms have made it easier for people to connect with others, but at the same time, they have also led to a decline in deep, meaningful relationships.On the other hand, others believe that computers are essential tools that they cannot live or work without. They argue that computers have made many tasks easier and more efficient, such as communication, research, and data analysis. For example, email and instant messaging have made it possible to communicate quickly and efficiently with people from all over the world. Additionally, computers have also enabled people to work remotely, which has improved work-life balance and increased productivity.In conclusion, while computers have their drawbacks, I believe that they are more of a help than a hindrance in today's society. Computers have revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and access information. However, it is essential to use them responsibly and maintain a balance between digital and face-to-face interaction. By doing so, we can maximize the benefits of computers while minimizing their negative effects.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;The debate surrounding the relative importance of social skills versus qualifications in the workplace has gained significant attention in recent years. While some employers emphasize the value of social skills, others remain steadfast in their belief that qualifications are the most critical factor in determining an individual's suitability for a job. In this essay, we will discuss both perspectives and offer a personal opinion on the matter.On one hand, proponents of the view that qualifications are the most important argue that they provide a clear indication of an individual's expertise and knowledge in a particular field. A degree or certification serves as a tangible representation of an individual's ability to perform specific tasks and tackle complex problems. Employers who prioritize qualifications believe that they are essential for meeting the technical demands of a job and ensuring that employees can carry out their responsibilities effectively.On the other hand, advocates of the importance of social skills argue that they are equally, if not more, crucial for success in the workplace. Social skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, enable individuals to collaborate with colleagues, interact with clients, and adapt to changing circumstances. In today's fast-paced and dynamic work environments, social skills are essential for building strong relationships, managing conflicts, and driving innovation.In my opinion, while qualifications are undoubtedly important, social skills are becoming increasingly vital for success in the modern workplace. As technology continues to advance and automation replaces routine tasks, employers are placing greater emphasis on skills that are uniquely human, such as creativity, empathy, and emotional intelligence. Moreover, social skills are transferable across different industries and roles, making them a valuable asset for employees seeking to switch careers or industries.In conclusion, both qualifications and social skills are essential for success in the workplace. However, as the nature of work continues to evolve, I firmly believe that social skills will play an increasingly prominent role in determining an individual's suitability for a job. Employers would do well to recognize the value of both qualifications and social skills, and strive to create a balanced approach to recruitment and talent development.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;The question of whether charities should prioritize aid to those in need globally or focus on their own country is a contentious issue. On one hand, some argue that charities should provide aid to those who need it most, regardless of their geographical location. This perspective is rooted in the idea that humanitarian crises, such as natural disasters, poverty, and conflicts, can occur anywhere and affect anyone. Charities should respond to these emergencies based on their severity and the level of need, rather than the location. For instance, a devastating earthquake in a developing country may require immediate international assistance to prevent further loss of life. By providing aid to those who need it most, charities can make a more significant impact and alleviate human suffering.On the other hand, some people believe that charity organizations would be more effective if they concentrated on people in their own countries. This viewpoint is based on the notion that charities have a responsibility to address the needs of their own citizens, particularly the most vulnerable members of society, such as the homeless, the elderly, and those with disabilities. By focusing on domestic issues, charities can develop a deeper understanding of the specific challenges facing their community and implement targeted solutions. Furthermore, supporting local causes can foster a sense of community and social cohesion, as people are more likely to engage with and donate to charities that address issues relevant to their daily lives.In my opinion, while both perspectives have valid points, I believe that charities should strike a balance between providing aid globally and addressing local needs. By allocating resources to both international emergencies and domestic causes, charities can maximize their impact and demonstrate their commitment to alleviating human suffering, regardless of geographical boundaries.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;The debate about whether students learn more from teachers in a traditional classroom setting or from alternative sources such as the internet and television has been ongoing. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement that students learn far more from lessons with teachers than from other sources.On one hand, teachers play a vital role in the learning process. They provide students with a structured and guided learning experience, allowing them to grasp complex concepts and ideas more effectively. Teachers can also offer personalized feedback, encouragement, and support, which can greatly enhance the learning process. Furthermore, teachers can facilitate discussions, debates, and group work, promoting critical thinking, problem-solving, and social skills.On the other hand, alternative sources such as the internet and television can also provide valuable learning opportunities. The internet, in particular, has revolutionized the way we access information, offering a vast array of educational resources, including online tutorials, lectures, and educational websites. Television documentaries and educational programs can also provide engaging and informative content, making learning more accessible and enjoyable.However, I believe that teachers are still essential in the learning process. While alternative sources can provide valuable information, they often lack the interactivity and human element that a teacher can provide. Moreover, teachers can help students to critically evaluate information, identify biases, and develop media literacy, skills that are essential in today's information age.In conclusion, while alternative sources can be useful learning tools, I believe that students still learn far more from lessons with teachers. Teachers provide a structured and guided learning experience, personalized feedback, and social skills that are essential for academic success.
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";The notion that international sporting events like the football World Cup serve to ease international tensions and channel patriotic emotions in a safe manner is a widely debated topic. In my opinion, I largely agree with this sentiment, as these events provide a platform for nations to compete in a controlled environment, fostering unity and reducing the likelihood of conflict.On one hand, the football World Cup and similar events offer a unique opportunity for nations to come together, share a common interest, and engage in friendly competition. The excitement and camaraderie generated by these events create a sense of global unity, as people from diverse backgrounds and cultures put aside their differences to cheer on their favorite teams. This shared experience helps to break down cultural and linguistic barriers, promoting cross-cultural understanding and tolerance.Moreover, international sporting events provide a safe outlet for patriotic emotions to be expressed, reducing the likelihood of conflict and aggression. By channeling national pride and competitive spirit into a controlled environment, these events prevent the escalation of tensions and hostility that might otherwise arise from nationalist sentiments. For instance, the 2018 World Cup match between arch-rivals Germany and Brazil was marked by intense competition on the field, yet friendly interactions between fans and players off the field, demonstrating the ability of these events to diffuse tensions.However, it is also essential to acknowledge that these events can sometimes be marred by instances of hooliganism, racism, and nationalist extremism, which can undermine their unifying potential. Nevertheless, these exceptions do not negate the overall positive impact of international sporting events in easing tensions and promoting global unity.In conclusion, while acknowledging potential drawbacks, I firmly believe that international sporting events like the football World Cup play a vital role in easing international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;The debate surrounding the effectiveness of distance-learning programmes has been ongoing for quite some time. While some individuals swear by the flexibility and convenience offered by these programmes, others are convinced that they lack the rigour and benefits of traditional college or university education. In my opinion, I agree that distance-learning programmes may not bring the same benefits as attending college or university.First and foremost, distance-learning programmes often lack the face-to-face interaction and human connection that is inherent in a traditional classroom setting. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection among students, which can negatively impact their motivation and overall learning experience. Furthermore, many distance-learning programmes rely on pre-recorded lectures and online materials, which can be dry and lacking in engagement.In contrast, attending college or university provides students with the opportunity to engage in lively discussions, debates, and group work, all of which are essential for developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills. Additionally, traditional educational institutions offer access to a wide range of resources, including libraries, laboratories, and career counselling services, which can greatly enhance a student's learning experience.Another concern with distance-learning programmes is the lack of support and guidance. Without regular face-to-face interactions with instructors and peers, students may struggle to stay on track and overcome challenges. This can be particularly problematic for students who require additional support or have learning difficulties.That being said, it is worth noting that distance-learning programmes can be a viable option for individuals who are unable to attend traditional institutions due to work or family commitments. However, for those who have the means and opportunity to attend college or university, I firmly believe that the benefits of traditional education outweigh those of distance-learning programmes.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;"The extinction of various species has become a pressing issue in today's world. While some argue that we should prioritize protecting these animals from dying out, others contend that we should focus on solving human problems instead. Both perspectives have valid points, and a balanced approach is necessary.On one hand, protecting endangered species is crucial for maintaining the delicate balance of our ecosystem. The loss of a single species can have a ripple effect, impacting the entire food chain and potentially leading to the collapse of entire ecosystems. Furthermore, many species possess unique characteristics that could hold the key to groundbreaking scientific discoveries and medical breakthroughs. For instance, the extinct gastric brooding frog, which incubated its eggs in its stomach, could have provided valuable insights into human reproductive health.On the other hand, some argue that the needs of human beings should take precedence over those of animals. With pressing issues such as poverty, hunger, and disease still plaguing many parts of the world, it is reasonable to question whether resources should be diverted towards protecting species that may be considered less important. Moreover, human welfare is inextricably linked to the health of our planet; investing in human development can have a positive impact on the environment, as educated and affluent populations tend to be more environmentally conscious.In my opinion, a balanced approach is necessary. While human problems should not be ignored, the protection of endangered species is equally important. Governments and organizations can work together to create sustainable solutions that address both human needs and environmental concerns. By investing in education, healthcare, and sustainable development, we can create a world where humans and animals can thrive together."
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;The debate about whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While some argue that this approach promotes gender equality and fairness, others believe that it may hinder the pursuit of academic excellence and merit-based admissions. In this essay, I will argue that I partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject can help address the existing gender imbalance in certain fields. For instance, in STEM fields such as engineering and computer science, women are significantly underrepresented. By actively promoting gender parity, universities can encourage more women to pursue these subjects, ultimately contributing to a more diverse and inclusive academic environment.On the other hand, implementing a rigid quota system may compromise academic excellence and fairness. If universities prioritize achieving a 50:50 ratio over selecting the most qualified candidates, it may lead to less qualified students being accepted, while more qualified ones are rejected due to their gender. This could undermine the integrity of the admissions process and potentially harm the overall quality of education.Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that different subjects may have varying levels of interest among men and women. Forcing equal numbers of each gender in every subject could result in some students being admitted to programs that do not align with their interests or strengths.In conclusion, while promoting gender equality is crucial, I believe that universities should strive for a balanced approach that prioritizes both diversity and academic excellence. Instead of rigid quotas, universities could focus on creating inclusive environments, providing support and resources for underrepresented groups, and promoting STEM education among women from an early age. By doing so, we can work towards achieving a more equitable and academically excellent academic environment.
140;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";I agree with the statement that face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls. Face-to-face communication allows for a more personal and engaging interaction, which can lead to stronger relationships and more effective communication.One of the main advantages of face-to-face communication is the ability to read nonverbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions. These cues can provide valuable information about the other person's emotions and intentions, and can help to prevent misunderstandings. For example, if someone is speaking in a monotone voice, their body language may indicate that they are actually enthusiastic about the topic. This information would be lost in a letter or email, and may be difficult to convey over the phone.Another advantage of face-to-face communication is the ability to build trust and rapport. When people meet in person, they can establish a connection and build a relationship more easily. This is because face-to-face communication allows for a more personal and intimate interaction, which can help to establish a sense of trust and understanding. In contrast, email and letters can come across as impersonal, and telephone calls can lack the visual cues that help to build rapport.Finally, face-to-face communication allows for more immediate feedback and clarification. When people communicate in person, they can ask questions and clarify points in real-time, which can help to prevent misunderstandings and ensure that both parties are on the same page. This is particularly important in business or academic settings, where clear communication is crucial.In conclusion, while other types of communication have their advantages, I believe that face-to-face communication is the most effective and personal way to communicate. By allowing for nonverbal cues, building trust and rapport, and providing immediate feedback, face-to-face communication is better than letters, email, or telephone calls.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;"I think you meant ""Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweigh the advantages?""The advancement in medical care has led to a significant increase in life expectancy, resulting in people living longer than ever before. While this trend may seem overwhelmingly positive, it is essential to weigh the advantages against the disadvantages.On the one hand, the benefits of increased life expectancy are undeniable. People are now able to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives, contributing to society and enjoying time with their loved ones. Improved medical care has also enabled individuals to pursue their passions and interests, leading to personal fulfillment and happiness.On the other hand, there are several disadvantages to this development. One significant concern is the strain on resources, particularly in pension and healthcare systems. With more people living longer, there is increased pressure on these systems, potentially leading to financial instability and reduced quality of care. Additionally, the growing elderly population may lead to a shortage of caregivers, placing a burden on family members and social services.Moreover, the increased life expectancy may also lead to social and environmental issues, such as overpopulation and increased resource consumption. The strain on the environment, housing, and infrastructure may become overwhelming, particularly in areas with limited resources.In conclusion, while increased life expectancy is a remarkable achievement, I believe that the disadvantages do not outweigh the advantages. However, it is crucial that we address the challenges arising from this trend, investing in sustainable solutions and resource management to ensure that the benefits of improved medical care are available to all, while minimizing the negative consequences."
142;Successful people do something new or take risks rather than only doing something they know how to do well. AGREE OR DISAGREE.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.Admittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";"In today's fast-paced and dynamic world, it's often said that successful people are those who continually challenge themselves by taking risks and embracing new experiences. I strongly agree with this notion, as I believe that a willingness to step out of one's comfort zone and explore uncharted territories is a crucial factor in achieving success.Doing something new or taking risks allows individuals to grow and learn at an exponential rate. By venturing into the unknown, they are forced to think creatively, develop problem-solving skills, and adapt to novel situations. This, in turn, helps to build confidence, resilience, and a sense of self-efficacy – all of which are essential qualities for success. Moreover, taking risks and trying new things can lead to the discovery of new passions, talents, and interests, which can ultimately lead to a more fulfilling and purpose-driven life.Furthermore, playing it safe and only doing what one knows how to do well can lead to stagnation and complacency. When individuals become too comfortable with their abilities, they may miss out on opportunities for growth and innovation. In contrast, those who take risks and push themselves beyond their limits are more likely to achieve breakthroughs and make meaningful contributions in their field.Of course, there are risks involved with taking risks, and not every new endeavor will be successful. However, it's the willingness to learn from failures and use them as stepping stones for future success that truly sets successful people apart. As the famous entrepreneur, Richard Branson, once said, ""Do not be embarrassed by your failures, learn from them and start again."" In conclusion, I firmly believe that successful people are those who continually challenge themselves by taking risks and trying new things, rather than playing it safe and sticking to what they know. By embracing this mindset, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve greatness."
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;The debate surrounding the availability of higher education has sparked intense discussion among educators and policymakers. Some argue that college or university education should be accessible to all students, while others contend that it should be reserved for high-achieving students. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and explain why I support the view that higher education should be available to all students.On one hand, the argument that higher education should only be available to good students is based on the notion that academic rigor and selectivity are essential for maintaining the quality of institutions. Proponents of this view believe that admitting only top students ensures that resources are allocated efficiently and that students are well-prepared for the academic demands of higher education. However, this approach may unfairly exclude students who may not have had equal access to quality education or resources in the past.On the other hand, the argument that higher education should be available to all students is grounded in the belief that education is a fundamental right that should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or academic record. This approach acknowledges that students have different learning styles and abilities, and that some may require additional support or time to reach their full potential. Moreover, providing access to higher education for all students can lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, which is essential for economic growth and social mobility.In my opinion, higher education should be available to all students. By doing so, we can promote social equality and provide opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in today's complex world. Additionally, this approach can help to address issues of social injustice and promote economic development. While some may argue that this approach may compromise academic standards, I believe that with proper support and resources, all students can achieve their academic goals and reach their full potential.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The allocation of resources in universities is a crucial aspect of providing students with a comprehensive education. While some may argue that hiring famous teachers is the key to a university's success, I firmly believe that spending money on improving facilities is a more effective way to enhance the learning experience.First and foremost, state-of-the-art facilities provide students with hands-on experience and practical skills that are essential in today's fast-paced, technology-driven world. Modern laboratories, well-equipped libraries, and advanced computer systems enable students to conduct experiments, access vast resources, and work on projects that simulate real-world scenarios. This experiential learning approach not only deepens students' understanding of theoretical concepts but also prepares them for the demands of their future careers.On the other hand, hiring famous teachers, although beneficial in terms of attracting students and boosting a university's reputation, may not necessarily translate to better learning outcomes. While renowned professors may bring prestige and excitement to a university, their presence may not guarantee a more effective learning environment. In fact, research has shown that the quality of teaching is not always correlated with a professor's fame or research reputation.Moreover, improved facilities can benefit a larger number of students and faculty members, whereas the impact of a single famous teacher may be limited to a specific department or student body. Furthermore, investing in facilities can lead to long-term cost savings and increased efficiency, as modern equipment and sustainable buildings reduce energy consumption and maintenance costs.In conclusion, while hiring famous teachers may have its advantages, I firmly believe that universities should prioritize spending money on improving facilities. By doing so, they can provide students with a more comprehensive and practical education, better preparing them for success in their chosen fields.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;I strongly agree with the statement that high schools should allow students to study the courses they want to study. Providing students with the autonomy to choose their courses can have a profound impact on their academic motivation, engagement, and overall success.One of the primary reasons for allowing students to choose their courses is that it enables them to pursue their interests and passions. When students are interested in a subject, they are more likely to be motivated to learn and excel in it. For instance, a student who is passionate about music may want to take music theory or composition courses, which may not be offered in a traditional curriculum. By allowing students to choose their courses, high schools can provide them with the opportunity to develop their talents and interests.Another reason for allowing students to choose their courses is that it prepares them for the real world. In college and in the workforce, individuals have the freedom to choose their courses and career paths. By giving high school students a similar level of autonomy, schools can help them develop the skills and decision-making abilities they need to succeed in the future.Furthermore, allowing students to choose their courses can help to reduce the dropout rate and improve academic achievement. When students are forced to take courses that they are not interested in, they may become disengaged and disillusioned with the learning process. By providing students with choices, high schools can increase student engagement and motivation, leading to better academic outcomes.In conclusion, allowing high school students to choose their courses is essential for their academic success and personal development. By providing students with autonomy and choices, high schools can help them to pursue their interests, develop their talents, and prepare them for the real world.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;"The statement ""Games are as important for adults as they are for children"" is a topic of ongoing debate. While some may argue that games are a childish pastime, I firmly agree with the statement. Games are essential for adults, providing numerous benefits that enhance their cognitive, social, and emotional well-being.Firstly, games have been proven to improve cognitive function in adults. Engaging in mentally stimulating activities such as puzzle games, strategy games, and brain teasers can help prevent cognitive decline and even reduce the risk of dementia. For instance, a study published in the journal Neuropsychologia found that adults who played video games showed significant improvements in their spatial attention and processing speed compared to non-gamers.Secondly, games provide adults with opportunities for social interaction and bonding. Multiplayer games, such as online multiplayer games, bring people together, fostering teamwork, communication, and camaraderie. These social connections are essential for adults, who often lead busy lives and may struggle to find time for social activities. Games also provide a common interest, helping to break the ice and build relationships with others.Lastly, games offer adults a healthy outlet for stress and anxiety. In today's fast-paced world, adults face numerous pressures, from work-related stress to personal responsibilities. Games provide a much-needed escape, allowing adults to temporarily forget about their worries and immerse themselves in a virtual world. For example, the popular game ""Minecraft"" has been praised for its therapeutic benefits, providing players with a calming and creative outlet.In conclusion, games are indeed as important for adults as they are for children. They offer a range of benefits, from cognitive improvement to social connections and stress relief. As adults continue to lead increasingly busy and complex lives, games provide a valuable tool for relaxation, socialization, and personal growth."
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";The advent of modern technology has revolutionized the way people interact, access information, and share ideas globally. While some argue that this phenomenon is creating a single world culture, I partially disagree with this statement. On one hand, modern technology has undoubtedly bridged geographical gaps, enabling people from diverse cultural backgrounds to connect and exchange ideas.Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, have become ubiquitous, allowing users to share their thoughts, experiences, and cultural practices with a global audience. This has led to a homogenization of cultural values and practices, as people adopt and emulate trends, music, and art from other cultures. For instance, K-pop, a genre originating from South Korea, has gained immense popularity worldwide, transcending cultural boundaries. Similarly, online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay have made it possible for people to access products and services from different cultures, further contributing to the exchange of cultural practices.However, despite these converging forces, cultural diversity still persists. Modern technology has also enabled people to connect with others who share similar cultural backgrounds, interests, and values. This has led to the proliferation of online communities and forums centered around specific cultural practices, such as language, religion, or ethnicity. For example, online language courses and cultural websites have made it possible for people to learn about and engage with their ancestral cultures, thereby preserving cultural heritage.Furthermore, the concept of a single world culture is problematic, as it assumes that cultures are static and can be reduced to a singular entity. Cultures are dynamic, complex, and multifaceted, and modern technology has actually enabled people to celebrate and express their unique cultural identities. In conclusion, while modern technology has certainly facilitated the exchange of cultural practices and values, it is unlikely to create a single world culture. Instead, it has enabled people to engage with, learn from, and appreciate diverse cultures, ultimately enriching our global cultural landscape.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;The notion that success is more readily attainable with the assistance of one's family has garnered considerable debate in recent times. While some argue that familial support has always played a pivotal role in achieving success, others posit that the current societal landscape has rendered it easier for individuals to reach their goals with the aid of their family. As a staunch proponent of the latter viewpoint, I firmly believe that the contemporary era has indeed made it more accessible for individuals to attain success with the help of their family.One of the primary reasons for this assertion is the enhanced access to resources and networks that families can provide in today's world. With the proliferation of social media and the internet, families can now effortlessly connect with a vast array of people, potentially opening doors to new opportunities and collaborations. Moreover, the increasing number of family-run businesses and entrepreneurial ventures has enabled family members to work together, pooling their skills and expertise to drive success.Another significant factor contributing to the ease of achieving success with familial support is the changing nature of work and education. The advent of remote work and online learning platforms has made it possible for family members to support one another in their pursuits, regardless of geographical location. This has been particularly beneficial for individuals with caregiving responsibilities or those living in remote areas, who can now more easily balance their personal and professional obligations with the aid of their family.In conclusion, while it is undeniable that familial support has always been a crucial factor in achieving success, I firmly believe that the current era has rendered it significantly more accessible for individuals to reach their goals with the help of their family. By providing enhanced access to resources, networks, and flexible work arrangements, families can now play an even more pivotal role in fostering success.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";"The statement that reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies has been a topic of debate for many years. While some people may agree with this statement, others may have differing opinions. In my opinion, I firmly believe that reading fiction is indeed more enjoyable than watching movies.One of the primary reasons for this is the level of imagination and creativity that is required when reading fiction. When we read a novel or short story, our minds are able to create vivid images of the characters, settings, and plot, which can be tailored to our individual tastes and preferences. This process of imagination allows us to engage with the story on a deeper level, making the experience more enjoyable and immersive. On the other hand, watching a movie is a more passive experience, where the visuals and storyline are presented to us without the need for imagination.Furthermore, reading fiction allows us to set our own pace and control the flow of the story. We can speed up or slow down our reading, skip sections, or re-read parts that we found particularly interesting. This flexibility is not possible when watching a movie, where the pace is fixed and we are forced to follow the narrative at a predetermined speed.Another significant advantage of reading fiction is the level of detail and depth that can be conveyed through written language. Novels and short stories often explore complex themes, emotions, and ideas in a way that is not possible in a movie. For example, novels like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee or ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J.D. Salinger delve into the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters, providing a level of insight and understanding that is difficult to achieve in a movie.In conclusion, while watching movies can be an enjoyable experience, I firmly believe that reading fiction is more enjoyable due to the level of imagination and creativity required, the flexibility to control the pace of the story, and the depth of detail and exploration of complex themes and ideas."
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";The notion that a world with fewer languages promotes harmony and understanding between people has sparked a heated debate. On one hand, proponents of this idea argue that a reduced number of languages would facilitate communication and foster global unity. With a fewer languages, people from different cultures could easily interact and understand each other, promoting international cooperation and collaboration. This, in turn, could lead to a more harmonious and peaceful world.On the other hand, opponents of this idea contend that language diversity is a vital aspect of human culture and identity. The loss of languages would result in the erosion of cultural heritage and the homogenization of societies. Each language is a unique repository of history, traditions, and values, and its loss would be a loss for humanity as a whole. Moreover, languages are not just means of communication, but also a source of pride and identity for communities.In my opinion, the loss of languages is a negative trend that should be mitigated. While it is true that a common language can facilitate communication, it is also important to recognize the importance of language diversity in shaping our identities and cultures. The world would be a poorer place without the rich linguistic diversity that exists today. Furthermore, language preservation efforts can go hand in hand with language learning and promotion of a common language, such as English, which has become a global lingua franca.In conclusion, while a world with fewer languages may seem to promote harmony and understanding, it is a simplistic view that ignores the complexities of language and culture. Language preservation and promotion of linguistic diversity should be our priority, as they are essential to maintaining the rich tapestry of human cultures and identities.
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;The notion that elderly people often perceive their past as simpler and better than today is a common phenomenon. As a member of the younger generation, I partly agree with this sentiment. In many ways, the past did indeed offer a more uncomplicated way of life, but this perception also has its limitations.On one hand, the past was undoubtedly less complicated in terms of technology and social expectations. For instance, my grandparents recall a time when communication was limited to face-to-face conversations, letters, and landline phones. While this may seem restrictive by today's standards, they nostalgically remember the quality of their relationships and the depth of their conversations. In contrast, modern technology has made communication faster and more accessible, but it has also created a culture of instant gratification and shallow connections. Furthermore, the past often had more defined social roles and expectations, which, although limiting, provided a sense of security and belonging.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that the past also had its own set of problems and complexities. For example, my grandparents also recall a time of economic hardship, limited access to education and healthcare, and social injustices. These issues are often overlooked in nostalgic reminiscences, and it is crucial to recognize that the past was not always better.In conclusion, while I agree that the past was indeed simpler in many ways, I also believe that this perception is often romanticized. The past had its own unique set of challenges, and it is essential to approach nostalgia with a nuanced perspective. By recognizing both the benefits and drawbacks of the past, we can appreciate the progress we have made while still valuing the lessons and traditions that have been passed down to us.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;The argument that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as an essential life skill has garnered significant attention in recent years. As a strong advocate for this proposal, I firmly agree that financial literacy is a vital skill that should be incorporated into school curricula.In today's world, managing finances effectively is a crucial aspect of achieving independence and stability. Students who learn how to handle money wisely will be better equipped to make informed decisions about their financial future, avoiding debt and financial pitfalls that can have long-term consequences. Moreover, financial literacy enables individuals to set realistic goals, prioritize needs over wants, and develop healthy spending habits.Integrating personal finance education into school curricula can have far-reaching benefits. Not only will students develop a stronger understanding of money management, but they will also acquire essential skills such as budgeting, saving, and investing. This knowledge will empower them to make responsible financial decisions, ultimately contributing to a more financially stable society. Furthermore, financial education can help bridge the gap between different socio-economic backgrounds, providing equal opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to improve their financial literacy.Some may argue that financial education is not a traditional academic subject and should not be prioritized. However, I firmly believe that the benefits of financial literacy far outweigh any potential drawbacks. In fact, many countries have already recognized the importance of financial education and have incorporated it into their national curricula, resulting in significant improvements in financial stability and responsibility among their citizens.In conclusion, I strongly agree that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as an essential life skill. By doing so, we can empower future generations with the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve financial stability, independence, and success.
153;Some single people like to live with a roommate, while others prefer to live alone. Which would you prefer? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.Apart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.Finally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.In conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.;The decision to live with a roommate or alone is a personal preference that varies greatly among single individuals. As a single person, I would prefer to live with a roommate, and I believe that this arrangement offers numerous benefits.First and foremost, living with a roommate provides an opportunity to share household expenses, such as rent and utilities, which can be a significant financial burden when living alone. For instance, according to recent studies, the average cost of a one-bedroom apartment in a major city is over $1,500 per month. By splitting this cost with a roommate, individuals can save a substantial amount of money that can be used for other purposes, such as traveling or pursuing hobbies.Another advantage of living with a roommate is the social aspect. When living alone, it can be easy to become isolated and disconnected from others, which can negatively impact mental and emotional well-being. On the other hand, living with a roommate provides a built-in social network, allowing individuals to form meaningful connections and friendships. For example, I have a friend who lives with two roommates, and they often host dinner parties and game nights, which have helped them build a strong sense of community and belonging.In addition to the financial and social benefits, living with a roommate can also provide a sense of security and safety. For instance, when living alone, individuals may feel vulnerable to break-ins or other safety concerns. However, when living with a roommate, there is always someone else present, which can provide a sense of reassurance and protection.In conclusion, while living alone has its advantages, I believe that living with a roommate is the better option for single individuals. The financial benefits, social opportunities, and sense of security and safety that come with living with a roommate make it an attractive choice for those who value these aspects of life.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;The debate over whether smoking should be permitted in restaurants has been a contentious issue for many years. While some argue that individuals have the right to smoke where they please, I firmly believe that smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.First and foremost, smoking is a serious health hazard that affects not only the smoker but also those around them. Secondhand smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic and can cause cancer. When smokers are allowed to smoke in restaurants, they put the health of others at risk, including employees, patrons, and even the owners. By prohibiting smoking in restaurants, we can protect the health and well-being of those who do not choose to smoke.Furthermore, smoking is a major annoyance for non-smokers. The smell of smoke can be overwhelming and unpleasant, and it can also linger on clothes, hair, and skin. This can be especially frustrating for those who are dining with family and friends, as the smell of smoke can ruin the dining experience. By prohibiting smoking, restaurants can provide a cleaner, healthier, and more enjoyable environment for all patrons.Additionally, many states have already implemented laws that prohibit smoking in restaurants, and these laws have been highly effective. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smoking bans in restaurants have led to a significant reduction in heart attacks, strokes, and other smoking-related illnesses. This is a clear indication that these laws are working and should be upheld.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. By doing so, we can protect the health and well-being of non-smokers, provide a cleaner and healthier environment, and uphold the laws that have been proven to be effective.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;The growing trend of violence in films has sparked a heated debate on its impact on youngsters. While some argue that it has no significant effect, I firmly believe that the increasing violence in films has affected youngsters in a profoundly negative way.One of the primary concerns is that exposure to violent films can desensitize youngsters to aggression and violence. When children are repeatedly exposed to graphic violence, they may become less empathetic towards the victims and more accepting of aggressive behavior. This can lead to a decrease in emotional intelligence and a higher likelihood of engaging in violent behavior themselves. Furthermore, research has shown that youngsters who watch violent films are more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior, such as fighting and bullying.Moreover, violent films can also distort youngsters' perceptions of reality. Films often portray violence as a means to achieve success or solve problems, which can lead to a glamorization of violence in the minds of youngsters. This can result in a lack of understanding of the consequences of violence and a decreased ability to resolve conflicts peacefully. Additionally, the constant exposure to violent imagery can lead to a heightened sense of fear and anxiety in youngsters, making them more susceptible to emotional and psychological problems.On the other hand, some argue that youngsters are capable of distinguishing between fantasy and reality, and that violent films can serve as a form of catharsis, allowing them to release pent-up emotions. However, I believe that these arguments are outweighed by the overwhelming evidence suggesting a negative correlation between violent film exposure and youngster behavior.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the growing violence in films has had a profoundly negative impact on youngsters. Parents, filmmakers, and policymakers must work together to ensure that youngsters are protected from the harmful effects of violent films, and that alternative forms of entertainment are promoted. By doing so, we can help raise a generation of empathetic, emotionally intelligent, and peaceful youngsters.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";"The statement that in order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources, is one that holds great truth in today's complex media landscape. With the proliferation of news outlets, it is increasingly crucial for individuals to seek out diverse perspectives and sources of information to remain well-informed.Relying on a single news source can lead to a narrow and biased understanding of current events. This is particularly problematic in today's era of ""fake news"" and partisan reporting, where outlets often prioritize sensationalism and ideology over fact-based journalism. By consuming news from a variety of sources, individuals can identify and challenge their own biases, as well as develop a more nuanced understanding of the issues at hand.Furthermore, different news sources often provide unique insights and perspectives that may not be covered by other outlets. For instance, a local newspaper may provide in-depth coverage of community issues, while a national news channel may offer a broader perspective on global events. By accessing multiple sources, individuals can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the world around them.Moreover, seeking out diverse news sources promotes critical thinking and media literacy. When individuals are exposed to different viewpoints and reporting styles, they are forced to evaluate the credibility and reliability of each source. This helps to develop their critical thinking skills, enabling them to make informed decisions and opinions.In conclusion, in order to be well-informed, it is essential to get information from many different news sources. By doing so, individuals can broaden their understanding of current events, challenge their own biases, and develop critical thinking skills. In today's complex media landscape, it is more important than ever to seek out diverse perspectives and sources of information in order to stay informed and engaged."
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;The preservation of old buildings has sparked intense debate between those who believe these structures are an essential part of our heritage and those who think that the land they occupy is too valuable to be used for such purposes. On one hand, it is understandable that the high value of land in cities may tempt developers to tear down old buildings and construct new, more profitable ones. This approach could lead to increased housing, office space, and revenue for the city. Moreover, some old buildings may require expensive maintenance and repairs, which could divert funds from other pressing social needs. On the other hand, preserving old buildings is crucial for maintaining a city's cultural identity and historical significance. These structures often serve as tangible links to the past, providing valuable insights into the lives and experiences of previous generations. Moreover, old buildings can be beautifully restored and repurposed, giving them a new lease on life and allowing them to continue contributing to the community. For example, many old buildings have been converted into museums, art galleries, and hotels, which attract tourists and support local businesses. In my opinion, the preservation of old buildings is essential for maintaining a city's unique character and cultural heritage. While it is true that land in cities is valuable, it is also important to consider the long-term benefits of preserving our historical structures. Not only do they provide a sense of continuity and belonging, but they also attract tourists, create jobs, and stimulate local economies. Furthermore, with careful planning and restoration, old buildings can be adapted to meet the needs of modern cities, making them a valuable resource for future generations. In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that preserving old buildings is crucial for maintaining the cultural identity and historical significance of our cities.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;The increasing importance of mobile phones in the lives of young people has sparked intense debate. While some argue that it is a positive development, others believe it has detrimental effects. As a young person myself, I have experienced the impact of mobile phones on my life and that of my peers.On the one hand, mobile phones have numerous benefits that contribute to their popularity among young people. For instance, they provide an efficient means of communication, enabling us to stay in touch with friends and family. Mobile phones also serve as a valuable resource for learning, with access to a vast array of educational apps, websites, and online materials. Furthermore, they offer a platform for self-expression and creativity, through social media and photography.On the other hand, I believe that the popularity of mobile phones has also led to several negative consequences. Excessive mobile phone use can lead to social isolation, decreased attention span, and decreased physical activity. I have witnessed friends and classmates spend hours scrolling through social media, missing out on face-to-face interactions and outdoor activities. Moreover, the constant notifications and distractions from mobile phones can be detrimental to academic performance and mental health.From my own experience, I have found that striking a balance between mobile phone use and other aspects of life is crucial. By setting boundaries and prioritizing activities that promote physical and mental well-being, I have been able to harness the benefits of mobile phones while minimizing their negative effects.In conclusion, the popularity of mobile phones among young people is a double-edged sword. While they offer numerous benefits, excessive use can lead to negative consequences. As young people, it is essential to be mindful of our mobile phone use and ensure that it complements, rather than controls, our lives.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";The age-old debate on whether fixed punishments or circumstantial considerations should be the basis for penalizing crimes has sparked intense discussion among scholars, policymakers, and the general public. While some advocate for a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach to punishment, others argue that the nuances of each case, including the circumstances and motivations behind the crime, should be taken into account.Proponents of fixed punishments argue that this approach ensures fairness, consistency, and deterrence. By establishing clear and predictable consequences for each type of crime, individuals are more likely to be discouraged from committing them. This approach also streamlines the judicial process, reducing the risk of bias and arbitrariness. However, critics counter that this rigid approach neglects the complexities of human behavior and the varied circumstances that lead individuals to commit crimes.On the other hand, considering the circumstances and motivations behind a crime allows for a more nuanced and context-specific approach to punishment. By taking into account factors such as mental health, socioeconomic status, and mitigating circumstances, judges can impose sentences that are more proportionate to the offense and tailored to the individual's specific situation. This approach acknowledges that individuals are not simply perpetrators of crimes, but complex beings with unique experiences, motivations, and capacities for rehabilitation.Ultimately, a balanced approach that incorporates both fixed punishments and circumstantial considerations may be the most effective and just. By establishing guidelines for punishments while also allowing for judicial discretion, the criminal justice system can ensure fairness, consistency, and a commitment to rehabilitation. By recognizing the complexities of human behavior and the varied circumstances that lead individuals to commit crimes, we can work towards a more compassionate and effective approach to justice.
160;Some people prefer to spend their free time outdoors. Other people prefer to spend their leisure time indoors. Would you prefer to be outside or would you prefer to be inside for your leisure activities? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your choice.;People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. Moreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.Admittedly, indoor activities are fun. There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity. Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time.;When it comes to spending leisure time, people are often divided into two groups: those who prefer the great outdoors and those who enjoy the comfort of being indoors. As for me, I firmly believe that spending time outdoors is the way to go. Not only does it provide numerous physical and mental health benefits, but it also offers a wide range of exciting activities that can be enjoyed with friends and family.First and foremost, being outdoors allows me to stay active and healthy. Whether it's going for a hike, playing sports, or simply taking a walk in the park, there are countless ways to get some exercise and fresh air while having fun. For instance, I love playing basketball with my friends on weekends, which not only helps us stay physically fit but also strengthens our bonds and creates lasting memories.Another reason I prefer spending time outdoors is that it provides an opportunity to connect with nature and appreciate its beauty. Whether it's watching a sunset, stargazing on a clear night, or simply observing the changing seasons, being outdoors allows me to appreciate the world around me and feel a sense of wonder and awe. For example, I recently went on a camping trip with my family, where we spent a night under the stars, roasting marshmallows, and sharing stories around the campfire. It was an unforgettable experience that reminded me of the importance of taking time to appreciate the simple things in life.In conclusion, while some people may prefer spending their leisure time indoors, I firmly believe that the outdoors offers a more exciting and rewarding experience. From staying active and healthy to appreciating nature's beauty, there are countless reasons to get outside and make the most of our free time.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap air travel has made it possible for ordinary people to explore the world beyond their geographical boundaries. While many applaud this development, citing the freedom and opportunities it brings, others express concern over its environmental implications. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and offer my opinion on the matter.On the one hand, cheap air travel has revolutionized the way people travel. It has enabled individuals to visit distant lands, experience different cultures, and form connections that were previously unimaginable. This has had a profound impact on personal growth, global understanding, and economic development. Moreover, the increased accessibility of air travel has also boosted the tourism industry, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. Proponents of cheap air travel argue that it is a fundamental right, and that making it more expensive would be regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income individuals and families.On the other hand, the environmental impact of air travel cannot be ignored. The aviation industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around 2.5% of global carbon emissions. As air travel becomes more affordable, the number of flights increases, leading to a corresponding rise in emissions. Opponents of cheap air travel argue that the environmental costs outweigh the benefits, and that making air travel more expensive would encourage people to think twice before embarking on non-essential flights, thereby reducing the industry's carbon footprint.In my opinion, while cheap air travel has its advantages, the environmental concerns cannot be dismissed. A balanced approach is needed, one that promotes sustainable aviation practices while ensuring that air travel remains accessible to all. Governments and airlines can work together to implement eco-friendly measures, such as investing in cleaner fuels, improving aircraft efficiency, and offsetting emissions. Additionally, taxes on air travel can be levied in a way that discourages frequent, non-essential flights while keeping prices affordable for those who need to travel. Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance between the benefits of air travel and the need to protect our planet.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;The debate about whether to live in a small town or a big city has been ongoing for years. While some people prefer the quiet, close-knit community of a small town, others enjoy the fast-paced, diverse lifestyle of a big city. Personally, I would prefer to live in a big city.First and foremost, big cities offer a wide range of job opportunities. Unlike small towns, where job options are limited, cities have a diverse range of industries, from finance to technology to healthcare. This diversity allows individuals to pursue their passions and interests, leading to greater job satisfaction. For instance, cities like New York and London are hubs for the finance and banking industries, attracting top talent from around the world.Another advantage of living in a big city is the access to cultural and entertainment activities. Cities are home to world-class museums, theaters, and music venues, offering endless options for leisure and enrichment. For example, Paris, the city of light, is renowned for its art museums, fashion shows, and romantic river cruises. In contrast, small towns often have limited cultural and entertainment options, making life feel monotonous.Additionally, big cities are melting pots of different cultures, cuisines, and lifestyles. The diversity of cities allows individuals to experience new cultures, try new foods, and make friends from all over the world. For instance, cities like Toronto and Sydney are known for their multicultural neighborhoods, where one can find authentic ethnic restaurants, shops, and cultural events.In conclusion, while small towns have their own charm, I would prefer to live in a big city. The opportunities for career advancement, cultural enrichment, and diversity make city living an attractive option for me. While small towns may offer a quieter, more close-knit community, I believe that the benefits of city living outweigh the drawbacks.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;"Rewarding employees for their good work is crucial for boosting their morale, motivation, and overall job satisfaction. While salary increases and promotions are traditional ways to recognize employees' hard work, they are not the only effective methods. In fact, there are various alternative rewards that can be just as motivating and encouraging.One such reward is recognition and praise. Publicly acknowledging employees' achievements and expressing gratitude can go a long way in motivating them to continue delivering good work. For instance, companies can have an ""Employee of the Month"" or ""Star Performer"" award, where the recipient's name and achievement are displayed on a company-wide platform. This not only boosts the employee's confidence but also sets a positive example for their colleagues.Another effective reward is providing opportunities for growth and development. Offering training, mentorship, or education assistance can help employees enhance their skills and advance in their careers. For example, Google's famous ""20% time"" policy allows employees to dedicate 20% of their worktime to side projects, which has led to numerous innovations and employee satisfaction.Additionally, work-life balance benefits can be a significant reward for good work. Flexible working hours, telecommuting options, or compressed workweeks can greatly improve employees' quality of life and increase their job satisfaction. Companies like Patagonia and REI offer on-site childcare and flexible scheduling, which has resulted in increased employee retention and productivity.Lastly, employee perks and benefits can also be an effective reward. Free meals, gym memberships, or on-site fitness classes can demonstrate a company's appreciation for its employees' hard work. For example, Facebook offers free meals and on-site laundry facilities, which has contributed to its reputation as a desirable workplace.In conclusion, while salary increases and promotions are important, they are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. Recognition, growth opportunities, work-life balance benefits, and employee perks can be just as effective in encouraging further good work. By offering a range of rewards, companies can create a motivated and engaged workforce that drives business success."
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;"The debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes or not has been a long-standing issue. While some argue that attending classes should be compulsory, others believe that it should be optional. In my opinion, I agree that university students should be required to attend classes.Firstly, attending classes is crucial for academic success. When students attend classes regularly, they are able to engage with the instructor, ask questions, and clarify any doubts they may have. This interaction is essential for understanding complex concepts and ideas, which are often difficult to grasp through self-study alone. Moreover, attending classes also helps students to stay motivated and focused, as they are able to gauge their progress and receive feedback from their instructors.Secondly, attending classes is also important for developing essential skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. University classes often involve group discussions, presentations, and projects, which require students to work collaboratively and share their ideas. By attending classes, students are able to develop these skills, which are highly valued by employers and are essential for success in the workforce.Furthermore, attending classes also helps students to make the most of the university experience. University is not just about academics; it is also about networking, building relationships, and developing social skills. By attending classes, students are able to connect with their peers and instructors, which can lead to valuable connections and opportunities.In conclusion, while some may argue that attending classes should be optional, I firmly believe that it should be compulsory. Attending classes is essential for academic success, developing essential skills, and making the most of the university experience. By requiring students to attend classes, universities can ensure that students receive the best possible education and are well-prepared for success in their chosen careers."
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;The debate about whether to live in a small town or a big city has been ongoing for years. While some people prefer the tranquility and close-knit community of a small town, others enjoy the hustle and bustle of a big city. As for me, I would prefer to live in a big city.On one hand, small towns offer a sense of security and familiarity. Residents know and look out for each other, creating a strong sense of community. Additionally, the pace of life is generally slower, allowing for a more relaxed and peaceful environment. However, I believe that the benefits of living in a big city outweigh those of a small town.Big cities offer a wide range of opportunities for education, career advancement, and cultural enrichment. They are often hubs for various industries, providing numerous job opportunities and a chance to network with people from diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, cities are typically equipped with better infrastructure, including public transportation, healthcare facilities, and entertainment venues.Another advantage of living in a big city is the diversity and anonymity it provides. With people from different cultures and backgrounds living together, cities offer a unique and exciting environment that is always bustling with activity. Additionally, the anonymity of a big city allows individuals to maintain their privacy and independence, which is often lacking in small towns where everyone knows each other's business.In conclusion, while small towns have their advantages, I believe that the opportunities and diversity offered by big cities make them a more desirable place to live. The fast-paced and dynamic environment of a big city is exhilarating and provides individuals with the chance to grow and develop both personally and professionally.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;The impact of computers on modern life is a contentious issue, with some people believing they have made life easier and more convenient, while others think they have added complexity and stress. In my opinion, computers have both simplified and complicated life, depending on how they are used.On the one hand, computers have made life easier and more convenient in many ways. For instance, online shopping and banking have saved people time and effort, allowing them to manage their finances and shop from the comfort of their own homes. Additionally, the internet has provided access to a vast amount of information, making it easier for people to learn new skills, research topics, and stay informed about current events. Furthermore, computers have enabled instant communication through email and social media, allowing people to stay connected with friends and family who live far away.On the other hand, computers have also made life more complex and stressful. For example, the constant stream of notifications and updates from social media and news outlets can be overwhelming and stressful. Moreover, the need to constantly update and maintain computers, software, and antivirus programs can be time-consuming and frustrating. Moreover, the rise of cybercrime and online harassment has added a new layer of complexity and stress to life. Finally, the reliance on computers and technology has led to a decline in face-to-face communication skills and deep thinking, as people rely more on Google and instant answers.In conclusion, computers have both simplified and complicated life. While they have made many tasks easier and more convenient, they have also added complexity and stress. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to use computers in a way that maximizes their benefits and minimizes their drawbacks.
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;The advent of computers and modems has revolutionized the way people work, making it possible for office workers to perform their tasks from the comfort of their own homes. This phenomenon, known as telecommuting or working from home, has sparked a debate about its merits. While some argue that working from home should be encouraged, others believe it is not beneficial. In my opinion, I disagree with the notion that working from home is always good and should be encouraged for all workers and employees.On the one hand, working from home can offer numerous benefits, such as increased flexibility, reduced commuting time, and improved work-life balance. It can also lead to higher productivity, as employees are away from the distractions and interruptions that often plague traditional office environments. Additionally, working from home can be a boon for employees with disabilities or those living in areas with limited job opportunities.On the other hand, working from home can also have its drawbacks. Social isolation, lack of structure, and blurred boundaries between work and personal life can negatively impact an employee's mental and physical health. Moreover, some jobs require face-to-face interaction, teamwork, and spontaneous communication, which can be difficult to replicate in a home-based setting. For instance, jobs that require intense collaboration, creativity, and innovation, such as those in the tech industry, may suffer from the lack of in-person interactions.Furthermore, some employees may struggle with self-motivation and discipline, leading to decreased productivity and performance. Managers may also find it challenging to monitor and evaluate employee performance, leading to concerns about accountability and trust.In conclusion, while working from home can offer benefits, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Its effectiveness depends on the type of job, individual employee characteristics, and organizational culture. Rather than encouraging working from home across the board, employers should consider offering flexible work arrangements that cater to different employee needs and work styles. By doing so, they can reap the benefits of remote work while minimizing its drawbacks.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;The role of a university professor has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that they should focus on research, while others believe their primary responsibility is to educate students. In my opinion, I strongly believe that the main role of a university professor is to educate students.First and foremost, a university professor's primary function is to impart knowledge and skills to students. This is evident in the fact that universities are institutions of higher learning, and students pay tuition fees to acquire education. Professors are responsible for creating and delivering curricula, teaching classes, and mentoring students. If professors were to focus solely on research, students would not receive the guidance and instruction they need to succeed in their studies.Furthermore, educating students is a critical component of a professor's job, as it prepares students for their future careers and contributes to the development of society. By focusing on teaching, professors can inspire and motivate students, helping them to develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and a love for learning. Additionally, professors can also provide students with valuable feedback and support, which is essential for their academic success.While research is also an important aspect of a professor's job, it should not come at the expense of teaching. In fact, research and teaching are interconnected, and a professor's research can often inform and enhance their teaching. Many professors use their research to create new courses, develop innovative teaching methods, and provide students with real-world examples and case studies.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the main role of a university professor is to educate students. While research is important, it should not take precedence over teaching. By prioritizing teaching, professors can make a positive impact on their students' lives, contribute to the development of society, and fulfill their primary responsibility as educators.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;The past century has witnessed unprecedented technological progress, revolutionizing numerous aspects of our lives. While it is undeniable that technology has brought about tremendous benefits, I agree that it also has its negative effects.On the one hand, technological advancements have greatly improved our standard of living, increased productivity, and transformed the way we communicate. The internet, for instance, has enabled instant global connectivity, bridging geographical gaps and fostering international collaboration. Moreover, technological innovations in medicine have led to the development of life-saving treatments and improved healthcare outcomes.On the other hand, the negative consequences of technological progress cannot be overlooked. One significant concern is the environmental impact of technology. The production and disposal of electronic devices, for example, have contributed to the growing problem of e-waste, polluting our environment and posing health risks. Furthermore, the increasing reliance on technology has led to a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in a surge in obesity, mental health issues, and other lifestyle-related diseases.Another negative effect of technological progress is the exacerbation of social inequalities. While technology has opened up new opportunities for some, it has also created a digital divide, leaving behind those who lack access to technology or the skills to use it effectively. This has resulted in a widening gap between the tech-savvy and the tech-illiterate, perpetuating existing social and economic disparities.In conclusion, while technological progress has undoubtedly brought about numerous benefits, its negative effects cannot be ignored. It is crucial that we acknowledge these drawbacks and work towards mitigating them, ensuring that the benefits of technology are equitably distributed and that its negative consequences are minimized. By doing so, we can harness the power of technology to create a more sustainable, equitable, and healthier world for all.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The notion that ""prevention is better than cure"" is a widely accepted principle in the realm of healthcare. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on shifting the focus from treatment to prevention, with many advocating for a significant diversion of a country's health budget from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. While I agree that prevention is crucial, I also believe that it is essential to strike a balance between the two approaches.On the one hand, investing in health education and preventative measures can have a significant impact on reducing the burden of diseases on the healthcare system. By educating the public on healthy lifestyles, disease prevention, and early detection, the incidence of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer can be significantly reduced. Preventative measures such as vaccination programs, screening tests, and health checks can also help identify and manage health issues before they become severe. By allocating a larger proportion of the health budget to these initiatives, governments can potentially reduce the overall healthcare expenditure in the long run.On the other hand, it is equally important to recognize that treatment is still a critical component of healthcare. Many diseases, such as cancer, require immediate and effective treatment to save lives. Reducing the budget for treatment would compromise the quality of care and put lives at risk. Furthermore, not all health issues can be prevented, and in such cases, treatment is the only option.In conclusion, while I agree that prevention is better than cure, I believe that a balanced approach is necessary. A country's health budget should be allocated in a way that prioritizes both prevention and treatment. By investing in health education and preventative measures, while also maintaining adequate funding for treatment, governments can ensure that their citizens have access to comprehensive and effective healthcare."
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;When it comes to choosing a place to live as a university student, one often finds themselves torn between living in university dormitories and apartments in the community. Both options have their unique advantages. Living in university dormitories offers the benefit of convenience and accessibility. Many dormitories are located on or near campus, reducing commuting time and allowing students to focus on their studies. Additionally, university dormitories provide students with a sense of community and camaraderie, with numerous opportunities to engage in social events and activities. The cost of living in a dormitory is often lower compared to living in an apartment, as meal plans and other amenities are frequently included in the cost.On the other hand, living in an apartment in the community offers more independence and flexibility. Students have the freedom to choose their own roommate, cook their own meals, and create their own living environment. Apartments often provide more space and amenities, such as a full kitchen and private bedrooms, making them feel more like a home. Moreover, living off-campus allows students to integrate into the local community, interacting with residents and local businesses, and developing a sense of responsibility and self-reliance.As a student, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community. While the convenience and social aspects of university dormitories are appealing, I believe that living off-campus offers a more well-rounded university experience. I value the independence and autonomy that comes with living in an apartment, and I believe that it would allow me to develop important life skills, such as time management and budgeting. Furthermore, I think that living off-campus would provide me with the opportunity to engage with the local community, exploring the city and discovering new places and experiences.
172;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.When people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. Finally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.;"The statement that ""a zoo has no useful purpose"" is a topic of ongoing debate. While some argue that zoos are merely a form of entertainment, I firmly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, zoos play a vital role in conservation, education, and research.First and foremost, zoos contribute significantly to conservation efforts. Many zoos are involved in breeding programs for endangered species, helping to increase population numbers and release animals back into the wild. For example, the California Condor Recovery Program, which began in the 1980s, has successfully increased the population of these birds from just 22 individuals to over 500. This program, which involves several zoos, has not only helped to save the species but also raised awareness about the importance of conservation.Zoos also serve as important educational institutions, providing people, especially children, with the opportunity to learn about different species and their habitats. By observing animals in a controlled environment, visitors can gain a deeper appreciation for the natural world and develop a sense of responsibility towards protecting it. Furthermore, many zoos offer interactive programs and activities, such as animal encounters and behind-the-scenes tours, which allow visitors to engage with animals in a more meaningful way.Finally, zoos support scientific research, which is essential for advancing our understanding of animal behavior, physiology, and ecology. By studying animals in zoos, scientists can gain valuable insights into animal behavior, which can inform conservation efforts and improve animal welfare.In conclusion, zoos have a multitude of useful purposes, including conservation, education, and research. While some may view zoos as mere entertainment, I firmly believe that they play a critical role in promoting the well-being of animals and the natural world. By supporting zoos and their conservation efforts, we can work towards a future where animals and their habitats are protected and preserved for generations to come."
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"The age-old debate between movies that educate and those that entertain has been a longstanding conundrum for cinephiles. As a film enthusiast, I have always been drawn to movies that amuse and entertain. In my opinion, these types of movies not only provide an escape from the monotony of daily life but also offer a unique form of storytelling that can evoke powerful emotions and create lasting memories.One of the primary reasons I prefer entertaining movies is that they have the ability to bring people together. Take, for example, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies. These films are designed to entertain, with their explosive action sequences, witty dialogue, and memorable characters. However, they also provide a shared experience that fans can enjoy together, whether it's cheering on their favorite superheroes or speculating about upcoming plot twists.Another reason I prefer entertaining movies is that they often showcase exceptional craftsmanship and creativity. Movies like ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""La La Land"" are testaments to the art of filmmaking, with their vibrant visuals, clever writing, and memorable performances. These films are not only entertaining but also visually stunning and aurally pleasing, making for a truly immersive cinematic experience.While serious movies have their place in the world of cinema, I believe that entertaining movies offer a unique brand of escapism and enjoyment that is hard to replicate. They provide a welcome distraction from the stresses of everyday life and offer a chance to experience new worlds, characters, and stories. In conclusion, as a film enthusiast, I firmly believe that entertaining movies are the way to go, offering a fun, engaging, and unforgettable cinematic experience that is sure to leave a lasting impression."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;The statement that television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities is a notion that I strongly agree with. In today's world, it is impossible to scroll through social media or turn on the TV without being bombarded with information about the personal lives of famous individuals. While it is understandable that people may be curious about the lives of those they admire, I believe that the media's constant scrutiny of celebrities' personal lives has reached an unhealthy level.One reason why I believe that the media pays too much attention to the personal lives of famous people is that it can be incredibly intrusive and invasive. Celebrities are human beings with flaws and imperfections, just like everyone else. However, when their every move is being watched and analyzed by the media, it can be overwhelming and even damaging to their mental health. For example, the intense media scrutiny surrounding the personal lives of celebrities such as Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan has been linked to their struggles with mental health.Furthermore, the media's obsession with celebrity gossip can also distract from more important issues and news. With the constant stream of information about celebrities' personal lives, it is easy to get caught up in the latest scandal or controversy and forget about the real issues that affect our world. This can lead to a lack of awareness and engagement with important social and political issues, which can have serious consequences.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the media pays too much attention to the personal lives of famous people. The constant scrutiny can be damaging to celebrities' mental health, and it can also distract from more important issues and news.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;When traveling to new places, many individuals often make it a point to visit local museums. This trend raises the question of what draws people to these institutions. In this essay, we will explore the various reasons behind the popularity of museum visits among travelers.First and foremost, museums offer a unique window into the culture, history, and identity of the places they visit. By showcasing local artifacts, artworks, and exhibits, museums provide visitors with a comprehensive understanding of the region's heritage. For instance, the Louvre in Paris is renowned for its impressive collection of French art, including the Mona Lisa, while the National Museum of China in Beijing offers insights into the country's rich cultural past. Visitors can engage with these exhibits, fostering a deeper appreciation for the local way of life.Another reason people visit museums is to learn about the history and evolution of a particular place. Museums often feature interactive displays, allowing visitors to participate in the learning process. The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C., for example, boasts an impressive collection of historic aircraft and spacecraft, offering a captivating glimpse into the history of aviation and space exploration. This interactive approach to learning makes museums an attractive destination for travelers seeking a memorable and enriching experience.Lastly, museums serve as a hub for artistic and intellectual expression. They often host temporary exhibitions, showcasing the work of local and international artists. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, for instance, is famous for its cutting-edge exhibitions, featuring the works of contemporary artists. By visiting museums, travelers can stay abreast of the latest artistic trends and developments, broadening their cultural horizons.In conclusion, the reasons behind the popularity of museum visits among travelers are multifaceted. Museums offer a unique glimpse into local culture and history, provide an interactive learning experience, and serve as a hub for artistic expression. As a result, they have become an integral part of the travel experience, allowing visitors to engage with the local identity and foster a deeper understanding of the places they visit.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we learn, presenting students with a unique dilemma: studying at home using technology or attending traditional schools. As a student, I firmly believe that attending traditional schools is the preferable option.While studying at home using technology may seem convenient and flexible, it lacks the social interaction and human connection that traditional schools provide. Schools offer a dynamic environment where students can engage with peers, share ideas, and develop essential social skills such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution. These skills are crucial in shaping our personalities, building relationships, and ultimately, succeeding in our careers.Moreover, traditional schools provide students with access to qualified teachers who can offer personalized guidance, feedback, and support. Teachers can identify areas where students need improvement and provide tailored instruction to address these weaknesses. This face-to-face interaction is essential in clarifying doubts, sparking curiosity, and fostering a love for learning.In contrast, studying at home using technology can lead to isolation, distraction, and a lack of motivation. Without a structured schedule and peer pressure, students may struggle to stay focused and maintain a consistent study routine. Furthermore, technology can be a double-edged sword, providing endless sources of information, but also distracting students with social media, email, and entertainment.While technology has its advantages, such as providing access to a vast array of educational resources and facilitating remote learning, it is no substitute for the rich, interactive experience offered by traditional schools. As a student, I value the opportunities for socialization, personal growth, and academic development that traditional schools provide. Therefore, I would unequivocally prefer attending traditional schools over studying at home using technology.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;The proposed construction of a large shopping center in our neighborhood has sparked a heated debate among residents. While some people may view this development as a positive addition to our community, I strongly oppose this plan. In my opinion, the potential drawbacks of this project far outweigh any perceived benefits.One of my primary concerns is the impact this shopping center will have on local traffic and congestion. Our neighborhood is already prone to traffic jams, especially during rush hour, and the influx of shoppers and delivery trucks will only exacerbate this problem. This will not only lead to frustration for commuters but also pose a safety risk for pedestrians and cyclists.Another reason I oppose this plan is the potential threat it poses to local businesses. Our neighborhood is home to many unique, family-owned shops and restaurants that give our community its character. The arrival of a large shopping center will likely lead to an increase in competition, which may force these businesses to close. This would be a loss not only for the business owners but also for the community, which would suffer from the loss of its distinct identity.Furthermore, I am concerned about the environmental impact of this project. The construction process will undoubtedly result in noise pollution, destruction of green spaces, and increased energy consumption. Additionally, the shopping center's day-to-day operations will likely generate significant amounts of waste and contribute to carbon emissions.While some may argue that the shopping center will bring in new jobs and revenue, I believe that these benefits are short-sighted and do not justify the long-term negative consequences of this project. Instead, I propose that our neighborhood focus on supporting and developing our existing local businesses, which will help maintain the unique character of our community while promoting sustainable growth.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, possessing the right skills is crucial for achieving success. Among various skills, one that stands out as particularly essential is adaptability. The ability to adapt to new situations, challenges, and technologies is vital for individuals to thrive in an increasingly complex and dynamic environment.Adaptability is essential in the modern workplace, where technological advancements and shifting market trends can render skills obsolete overnight. Employees who can quickly adjust to new software, tools, and processes are more likely to remain relevant and valuable to their organizations. For instance, a marketing professional who is proficient in social media advertising may need to adapt to new algorithms and platforms to stay effective. By being adaptable, they can pivot their strategies and continue to deliver results.Moreover, adaptability is critical in personal and professional relationships. As people navigate different cultural, social, and economic contexts, they must be able to adjust their communication styles, expectations, and behaviors to build strong connections and achieve their goals. For example, a entrepreneur who wants to expand their business into a new market must be able to adapt to local customs, languages, and regulations to establish a successful presence.In addition to its practical applications, adaptability is also a mindset that fosters resilience, creativity, and innovation. When individuals are open to new experiences and challenges, they are more likely to develop novel solutions, think outside the box, and bounce back from setbacks. As the world continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, the ability to adapt will become an increasingly valuable asset for anyone seeking to make a meaningful impact.In conclusion, adaptability is a vital skill for success in today's world. By being able to adjust to new situations, challenges, and technologies, individuals can remain relevant, build strong relationships, and drive innovation. As the pace of change continues to accelerate, cultivating adaptability will be essential for achieving personal and professional success.
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";The importance of groups or organizations in people's lives cannot be overstated. For many individuals, these collectives play a vital role in shaping their identities, fostering a sense of belonging, and providing a platform for personal growth. In this essay, we will explore the significance of groups or organizations and examine specific reasons why they are crucial to people's lives.Firstly, groups or organizations provide a sense of belonging and community, which is essential to human well-being. Being part of a group or organization gives individuals a feeling of being connected to others who share similar interests, values, or goals. For instance, sports teams, book clubs, or volunteer groups bring people together, creating a support network that enhances their overall quality of life. This sense of belonging boosts self-esteem, reduces feelings of loneliness, and increases motivation.Secondly, groups or organizations offer opportunities for personal growth and skill development. Professional organizations, such as industry associations or networking groups, provide members with access to training, mentorship, and career advancement opportunities. For example, a young professional may join a networking group to learn from experienced peers, gain new skills, and stay updated on industry trends. Similarly, community organizations, such as Rotary Club or Lions Club, provide members with opportunities to develop leadership skills, take on new challenges, and make a positive impact on their community.Lastly, groups or organizations provide a platform for people to pursue their passions and interests. Hobby-based groups, such as photography clubs or hiking groups, allow individuals to share their enthusiasm with like-minded people, learn from others, and improve their skills. For instance, a photography enthusiast may join a photography club to learn new techniques, go on photo shoots, and showcase their work.In conclusion, groups or organizations are essential to people's lives because they provide a sense of belonging, opportunities for personal growth, and a platform to pursue their passions. By being part of a group or organization, individuals can enhance their well-being, develop new skills, and connect with others who share similar interests.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;The announcement of a new university has sparked a heated debate in our community, with some residents enthusiastically supporting the idea and others expressing concerns. As a member of this community, I will weigh the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in our area.On the one hand, a new university would bring numerous benefits to our community. Firstly, it would create employment opportunities for locals, both during the construction phase and in the long term, as faculty and staff members. Additionally, the university would attract students from all over the country, injecting new life and diversity into our community. Local businesses would also benefit from the increased foot traffic, with potential new customers for shops, restaurants, and other services. Moreover, a university would enhance our community's reputation, making it a more attractive place to live and work.On the other hand, there are also valid concerns about the potential drawbacks of establishing a new university in our community. One major concern is the strain on our existing infrastructure, particularly our roads and public transportation systems. With an influx of new residents, our roads may become congested, and our public transportation systems may struggle to cope with the increased demand. Furthermore, the construction process would undoubtedly cause disruptions to local residents, with potential noise pollution and inconvenience. Finally, there is also the issue of affordable housing, as the arrival of students and faculty may drive up housing prices, making it difficult for long-term residents to find affordable accommodation.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the potential drawbacks of establishing a new university in our community, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. With careful planning and management, our community can reap the benefits of a new university, creating a vibrant and diverse community that benefits everyone.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";The debate on whether the government should provide free college education to its citizens has been a contentious issue for quite some time. On one hand, there are those who firmly believe that it is the government's responsibility to provide free college education to any citizen who wants it. They argue that education is a fundamental right and that it is essential for the development of a well-informed and educated society. Moreover, they point out that many developed countries already offer free or low-cost higher education, and that the United States should follow suit.On the other hand, there are those who believe that it is up to the individual to finance their own education. They argue that the government should not be responsible for providing free college education, as it would be a significant burden on taxpayers. They also point out that there are already many scholarships, grants, and financial aid programs available to help individuals fund their education. Furthermore, they argue that if individuals are not invested in their own education, they may not take it as seriously or work as hard to achieve their goals.In my opinion, the government should provide some level of financial assistance to individuals pursuing higher education. While it may not be feasible to provide completely free college education, the government could offer subsidies, scholarships, or low-interest loans to help individuals cover the costs of tuition. This would not only make higher education more accessible to those who may not have been able to afford it otherwise, but it would also benefit society as a whole by producing a more educated and skilled workforce.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";The notion that television has destroyed communication among friends and family is a contentious issue that has sparked intense debate. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement, as excessive television consumption can indeed negatively impact interpersonal relationships. However, I also believe that television can serve as a tool for social bonding and shared experiences.On the one hand, the proliferation of television has led to a significant decline in face-to-face interactions among friends and family. With the rise of reality TV shows and streaming services, people are increasingly spending more time alone, glued to their screens, and less time engaging in meaningful conversations with their loved ones. For instance, a study by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that excessive screen time can lead to social isolation, decreased empathy, and reduced communication skills in children.On the other hand, television can also serve as a platform for social bonding and shared experiences. Watching TV together can be a way for families and friends to spend quality time together, discussing and sharing their thoughts and opinions about the shows they watch. For example, many families gather around the TV to watch sports events, such as the World Cup or the Super Bowl, which can foster a sense of community and togetherness.Moreover, television can also provide a common ground for people to discuss and engage with each other. Watercooler moments, such as the finale of a popular TV show, can create a shared cultural experience that can bring people together and spark conversations.In conclusion, while excessive television consumption can negatively impact communication among friends and family, it is not the sole culprit behind the decline of interpersonal relationships. Rather, television can serve as a tool for social bonding and shared experiences, depending on how it is consumed and used.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life.";"The age-old debate about whether attending a live performance is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television has been a topic of discussion for many years. In my opinion, attending a live performance is undoubtedly more enjoyable than watching it on television. There are several reasons that support this argument, and I would like to highlight a few of them.First and foremost, a live performance offers a unique and immersive experience that cannot be replicated by television. When you attend a live event, you are not just a passive viewer; you are an active participant in the experience. You can feel the energy and excitement of the crowd, see the performers up close, and experience the sights and sounds of the event in a way that is not possible on television. For example, attending a live music concert allows you to experience the energy and charisma of the performers, as well as the collective excitement of the crowd, which is often lost in a television broadcast.Another reason why attending a live performance is more enjoyable is that it allows for a sense of community and shared experience. When you attend a live event, you are surrounded by people who share your interests and passions, creating a sense of camaraderie and shared experience. This is particularly evident at sporting events, where the energy and excitement of the crowd can have a significant impact on the outcome of the game. Watching the same event on television, on the other hand, can be a solitary experience, lacking the social interaction and shared excitement of a live event.In conclusion, attending a live performance is undoubtedly more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. The unique and immersive experience, sense of community and shared experience, and energy and excitement of the crowd all contribute to a more enjoyable experience that cannot be replicated by television."
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";The shift towards renewable energy sources is gaining momentum worldwide. In my opinion, I agree that renewable resources of energy, such as sun, wind, and water, will soon replace fossil fuels like gases, oil, and coal. This transition is inevitable due to the increasing awareness of climate change and the depletion of non-renewable resources.Firstly, the environmental impact of fossil fuels is a significant concern. Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, leading to global warming and climate change. In contrast, renewable energy sources are clean and produce little to no emissions, making them a more sustainable option. As governments and organizations prioritize reducing carbon footprints, the adoption of renewable energy sources will accelerate.Secondly, the cost of renewable energy is decreasing dramatically. The cost of solar panels and wind turbines has dropped significantly over the years, making them more competitive with fossil fuels. This trend is expected to continue, driving the growth of renewable energy.Thirdly, technological advancements are enhancing the efficiency and reliability of renewable energy sources. Improved energy storage systems and smart grids are addressing the intermittency of solar and wind power, enabling their wider adoption.Finally, governments and corporations are investing heavily in renewable energy infrastructure, driving growth and innovation in the sector. This investment is expected to lead to further cost reductions and improved technologies, making renewable energy more accessible and affordable for consumers.In conclusion, the shift towards renewable energy sources is underway, driven by environmental concerns, decreasing costs, technological advancements, and significant investments. As the world moves towards a more sustainable future, I firmly believe that renewable resources of energy will soon replace fossil fuels as the primary source of energy.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;I strongly disagree with the notion that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry outweigh the importance of saving land for endangered animals. While it is true that human necessities are crucial for survival, it is equally vital to recognize the intrinsic value of preserving biodiversity and the delicate balance of ecosystems.Firstly, endangered animals play a significant role in maintaining the health of our planet. They contribute to pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling, among other ecological processes. The loss of these species can have far-reaching and devastating consequences for the environment, ultimately affecting human well-being. For instance, bees, which are essential pollinators, are facing severe threats due to habitat loss and fragmentation. If we fail to protect their habitats, our food security and economy will suffer.Secondly, preserving land for endangered animals can also provide numerous benefits for humans. Protected areas can serve as natural buffers against climate-related disasters, such as floods and droughts, while also maintaining water quality and regulating the climate. Additionally, eco-tourism, which relies on the presence of these animals, can generate significant revenue and create jobs, contributing to local economies.Finally, it is a misconception that human needs and conservation are mutually exclusive. With careful planning and management, it is possible to balance human needs with conservation goals. For example, agroforestry and permaculture practices can promote sustainable agriculture while maintaining ecosystem services. Similarly, urban planning can incorporate green spaces and wildlife corridors, ensuring that human development coexists with nature.In conclusion, while human needs are important, they should not come at the expense of saving land for endangered animals. The preservation of biodiversity is crucial for maintaining ecological balance, ensuring human well-being, and promoting sustainable development. By adopting a holistic approach that balances human needs with conservation, we can create a future where both humans and animals thrive.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;The debate surrounding the most effective method of learning a foreign language has garnered significant attention in recent years. While some argue that learning a foreign language in its country of origin is more beneficial, others claim that studying in a country with a different primary language is just as effective. In this essay, I will present my perspective on this issue and argue that learning a foreign language in its country of origin is indeed more beneficial.First and foremost, learning a foreign language in its country of origin provides students with an immersive experience that cannot be replicated in a classroom setting. By surrounding themselves with native speakers, students are able to pick up on nuances of the language, such as idioms, colloquialisms, and cultural references, that are often difficult to learn through traditional teaching methods. Furthermore, being in the country of origin allows students to practice their language skills in real-life situations, such as ordering food, interacting with locals, and reading signs and menus.Additionally, learning a foreign language in its country of origin provides students with access to a wealth of cultural knowledge and understanding. By being immersed in the culture, students are able to gain a deeper understanding of the historical, social, and economic context in which the language is spoken. This, in turn, allows students to develop a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the language, which is essential for effective communication.In conclusion, while some may argue that learning a foreign language in a country with a different primary language is just as effective, I firmly believe that learning a foreign language in its country of origin is more beneficial. The immersive experience, access to cultural knowledge, and opportunities for real-life practice make learning a foreign language in its country of origin an unparalleled experience.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";In the debate over how to allocate time in the school day, opinions are divided between prioritizing physical exercise and focusing solely on academic studies. While both perspectives have their merits, I firmly believe that incorporating physical exercise into every school day is essential for the overall development and well-being of students.On one hand, academics are undoubtedly crucial for students' intellectual growth and future success. However, neglecting physical exercise can have severe consequences on students' physical and mental health. Regular physical activity has been proven to improve concentration, boost mood, and enhance cognitive function. By incorporating exercise into the school day, students can develop healthy habits, reduce stress, and perform better academically.Moreover, physical education provides a unique opportunity for students to develop essential life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Team sports, in particular, foster a sense of community and social responsibility, which are vital for students' emotional and social development. In contrast, a solely academic-focused school day may lead to a narrow and one-dimensional education, neglecting the importance of physical and social growth.It is also worth noting that physical exercise can be tailored to fit around academic schedules. For example, schools can incorporate physical activity into recess periods, offer sports clubs, or even integrate movement into classroom lessons. This way, students can still receive a comprehensive education while also reaping the benefits of regular exercise.In conclusion, while academic studies are undeniably important, I firmly believe that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. By prioritizing both physical and academic development, schools can provide students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;The concept of teenagers holding jobs while still in school is a contentious issue in many countries. Some argue that it is beneficial for their development, while others believe it can hinder their academic performance. In my opinion, having a job as a student can be a good idea, but only if managed correctly.On the one hand, having a part-time job can teach teenagers valuable skills such as time management, responsibility, and financial literacy. Many students who work part-time learn to prioritize their tasks, balancing schoolwork and job commitments. This skill is essential in adulthood, where individuals often have to juggle multiple responsibilities. Moreover, earning their own money allows students to develop a sense of independence and self-reliance, which can boost their confidence and motivation.On the other hand, if not managed correctly, a part-time job can negatively impact a student's academic performance. Spending too many hours at work can leave little time for studying, leading to poor grades and a lower chance of getting into a good college. Furthermore, some students may become too tired or stressed from working and studying, affecting their physical and mental health.To make part-time jobs beneficial for students, schools and governments should establish regulations and guidelines. For example, they could limit the number of hours students are allowed to work per week, ensuring they have enough time for their studies. Additionally, schools could offer flexible scheduling options, allowing students to balance their work and school commitments more easily.In conclusion, having a part-time job as a student can be beneficial if managed correctly. It can teach valuable skills, promote independence, and provide financial support. However, it is crucial that students, schools, and governments work together to ensure that part-time jobs do not hinder academic performance or negatively impact students' well-being.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;The debate surrounding the role of zoos in modern society has sparked intense discussion among animal lovers and experts alike. While some argue that zoos serve a useful function, others contend that confining animals in zoos is cruel and wrong. After careful consideration, I firmly believe that the latter perspective holds more merit.On one hand, proponents of zoos argue that they provide a safe haven for endangered species, support conservation efforts, and offer educational opportunities for the public. However, these benefits come at a steep cost. The confinement of wild animals in artificial environments can be detrimental to their physical and mental well-being. Many animals in zoos exhibit abnormal behaviors, such as pacing and self-mutilation, indicative of stress and frustration. Furthermore, zoos can never truly replicate the natural habitats and social structures that animals require to thrive.On the other hand, those who oppose zoos argue that these institutions prioritize human entertainment over animal welfare. By keeping animals in captivity, we are essentially treating them as commodities for our own amusement. This perspective is particularly compelling when considering the vast number of zoos that prioritize profits over animal care. The treatment of animals in these institutions is often inhumane, with inadequate space, poor living conditions, and a lack of stimulation.In conclusion, while zoos may have some redeeming qualities, the harm caused by confining animals in artificial environments far outweighs any potential benefits. It is our responsibility to treat animals with respect and compassion, and to prioritize their welfare above our own desires for entertainment and education. By supporting sanctuaries and conservation efforts that prioritize animal freedom and well-being, we can work towards a future where zoos are no longer necessary.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;When it comes to studying, individuals have different preferences on whether to do it alone or in a group setting. While some students find it more productive to study individually, others prefer the collaborative approach of studying in a group. As for me, I prefer to study with a group of students, and I will elaborate on the reasons behind my preference.Studying in a group offers numerous benefits, one of which is the opportunity to engage in discussions and debates. When studying with a group, we can share our ideas, insights, and perspectives on the subject matter, leading to a deeper understanding of the material. For instance, when preparing for an exam, we can form a study group where each member can focus on a specific topic and teach it to the others. This approach not only helps us to retain information better but also allows us to learn from one another.Another advantage of group studying is the element of accountability. When we study in a group, we are more likely to stay motivated and focused, as we feel responsible for contributing to the group's learning process. Furthermore, studying in a group setting allows us to divide tasks and share resources, making it easier to manage our workload.In addition, group studying promotes teamwork and communication skills, which are essential in real-world scenarios. By working together to achieve a common goal, we develop our ability to collaborate, negotiate, and resolve conflicts, all of which are valuable skills in both academic and professional settings.In conclusion, while studying alone has its benefits, I firmly believe that studying in a group offers more advantages. The collaborative approach not only enhances our understanding of the material but also fosters essential skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;Spending time with friends is a fundamental aspect of human relationships. Two distinct approaches to socializing exist: spending time with a small, intimate group of close friends, or with a larger, more diverse group of friends. Both approaches have their advantages, which will be discussed in this essay.Spending time with a small number of close friends offers the benefit of deeper, more meaningful relationships. With fewer friends, one can devote more time and energy to nurturing each relationship. This can lead to a stronger emotional bond, trust, and mutual understanding. Moreover, smaller social circles tend to be less dramatic and stressful, allowing for more relaxed and genuine interactions.On the other hand, spending time with a large number of friends has its own set of advantages. A larger social circle can provide a more diverse range of perspectives, experiences, and interests. This can lead to a broader worldview, new ideas, and a more dynamic social life. Additionally, having many friends can also provide a sense of belonging and social validation, as one feels connected to a larger community.Personally, I prefer spending time with a small number of close friends. I value the depth and intimacy that comes with investing time and energy in a few meaningful relationships. I find that I can be my authentic self around close friends, without fear of judgment or pretence. While I appreciate the benefits of a larger social circle, I feel that it can sometimes lead to superficial connections and a sense of disconnection.In conclusion, both approaches to spending time with friends have their advantages. While a larger social circle can provide diversity and a sense of belonging, I believe that spending time with a small number of close friends offers a more profound and fulfilling experience. Ultimately, the choice between these two approaches depends on individual preferences and values.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The age-old debate on whether governments should prioritize improving roads and highways or public transportation has been a contentious issue. While some argue that investing in roads and highways is crucial for economic growth and development, others contend that public transportation is a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly option. In my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation, specifically buses, trains, and subways.Firstly, public transportation is a more cost-effective and efficient way to move large numbers of people. According to the American Public Transportation Association, investing in public transportation can save commuters up to $1,000 per year, while also reducing traffic congestion and parking needs. Moreover, public transportation systems can be designed to accommodate more passengers, making them a more scalable solution than expanding road infrastructure.Secondly, investing in public transportation can have significant environmental benefits. Public transportation systems produce significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions per passenger than private vehicles, contributing to cleaner air and a healthier environment. Furthermore, by providing a reliable and efficient public transportation system, governments can reduce the reliance on private vehicles, which is a major contributor to urban pollution.Lastly, investing in public transportation can have a positive impact on social equity. Public transportation provides equal access to employment, education, and healthcare opportunities, regardless of income or social status. By improving public transportation, governments can help bridge the gap between low-income and affluent communities, promoting social mobility and inclusivity.In contrast, investing in roads and highways can lead to increased traffic congestion, pollution, and urban sprawl. While improving roads and highways may provide some economic benefits, these are often short-term and outweighed by the long-term costs of environmental degradation and social inequality.In conclusion, while both options have their merits, I firmly believe that governments should prioritize investing in public transportation. By doing so, they can promote a more sustainable, equitable, and efficient transportation system that benefits both the environment and society as a whole.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;"I strongly agree with the statement that animals should be free and people should not keep them in zoos. While zoos may have been created with the intention of educating the public about wildlife and promoting conservation, I believe that the benefits do not outweigh the negative consequences of keeping animals in captivity.Firstly, keeping animals in zoos deprives them of their natural habitats and freedom. In their natural environments, animals are able to roam freely, hunt for food, and engage in social behaviors that are essential to their well-being. In contrast, zoos often provide small enclosures that are a fraction of the size of the animals' natural habitats, leading to stress, boredom, and behavioral problems.Secondly, zoos are often criticized for their lack of transparency and accountability when it comes to animal welfare. Many zoos have been accused of prioritizing visitor numbers and profits over the health and well-being of the animals. For example, the documentary ""Blackfish"" exposed the mistreatment of orcas in SeaWorld, highlighting the dark side of the aquarium and theme park industry.Finally, there are alternative ways to educate the public about wildlife and promote conservation that do not involve keeping animals in captivity. For example, documentaries, wildlife sanctuaries, and conservation organizations offer opportunities for people to learn about and interact with animals in a way that prioritizes their welfare.In conclusion, while zoos may have been created with good intentions, I believe that the negative consequences of keeping animals in captivity outweigh any potential benefits. Animals should be free to roam in their natural habitats, and we should prioritize alternative ways to educate the public about wildlife and promote conservation."
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;The establishment of a new research center at a university in our country presents a valuable opportunity for innovation and growth. Two primary options are being considered: a center for business research and a center for research in agriculture. After careful consideration, I strongly recommend the development of a center for research in agriculture.Our country's economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, with a significant portion of the population engaged in farming and related activities. A research center focused on agriculture would address pressing issues such as crop yield improvement, sustainable farming practices, and rural development. By investing in agricultural research, we can enhance the productivity and efficiency of our farming sector, leading to increased food security and economic benefits for our people.Furthermore, a center for agricultural research would have a direct impact on the livelihoods of our rural communities. By providing farmers with access to cutting-edge technology and expertise, we can improve their income and quality of life. Additionally, such a center would also contribute to environmental sustainability by promoting eco-friendly farming practices and conservation of natural resources.In contrast, while a business research center would undoubtedly have its benefits, I believe that it would not have the same level of direct impact on our country's specific needs and challenges. Business research is a broad field that can be conducted in various settings, and its applications may not be as directly relevant to our country's agricultural-based economy.In conclusion, I firmly believe that a center for research in agriculture is the most suitable choice for our country. Its potential to drive economic growth, improve food security, and enhance the livelihoods of our rural communities makes it an investment that would yield significant returns for our nation.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;When it comes to learning, individuals have distinct preferences and methods that suit them best. While some people excel through hands-on experiences, others thrive through reading or listening. Personally, I find that learning by doing things is the most effective method for me.I recall my experience in a science class where we were learning about the water cycle. Instead of simply reading about the concept or listening to the teacher's explanation, our instructor had us design and conduct our own experiment to demonstrate the process. This hands-on approach allowed me to understand the complex concept in a tangible way. I was able to see the water evaporate, condense, and precipitate, making the abstract idea more concrete and memorable.Similarly, when I was learning a new language, I found that speaking and practicing with native speakers was far more effective than merely reading grammar books or listening to language tapes. By immersing myself in conversations and interactions, I was able to pick up the nuances of the language, including idioms, expressions, and pronunciation.In contrast, while reading and listening can be useful for gaining knowledge, I often find that these methods lack the depth and engagement that hands-on learning provides. When I read about a topic, I may retain some facts, but I rarely feel fully invested in the subject matter. Similarly, listening to lectures or discussions can be passive and may not hold my attention as well as actively participating in the learning process.In conclusion, learning by doing things is the most effective method for me. Through hands-on experiences, I am able to engage with the material, ask questions, and explore concepts in a way that is both enjoyable and memorable.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The debate surrounding the cost of air travel and its impact on the environment has sparked intense discussion in recent years. On one hand, many people believe that cheap air travel is a blessing for ordinary people, providing them with the freedom to explore and travel to distant destinations that were previously unaffordable. This increased accessibility has opened up new cultural and economic opportunities, allowing people to experience different cultures, visit loved ones, and conduct business across the globe. Moreover, the airline industry has played a significant role in boosting local economies, creating jobs, and stimulating tourism.On the other hand, there are valid concerns that cheap air travel contributes to environmental problems. The aviation industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with air travel accounting for around 2.5% of global carbon emissions. The rapid growth of air travel has led to increased pollution, noise, and waste, which have severe consequences for the environment and human health. To mitigate these effects, some argue that air travel should be more expensive to discourage people from flying and encourage more sustainable modes of transportation.In my opinion, while cheap air travel has its benefits, the environmental costs cannot be ignored. A balanced approach is needed, where the airline industry is encouraged to adopt more sustainable practices, such as using biofuels, electric planes, and more efficient engines. Additionally, governments can implement measures like carbon offsetting, taxes on emissions, and investing in alternative modes of transportation to reduce the industry's environmental footprint. Ultimately, a slight increase in air travel costs may be necessary to ensure that the industry's growth is sustainable and responsible.
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;The debate over whether governments should prioritize improving roads and highways or public transportation has been ongoing for years. In my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation, specifically buses, trains, and subways.First and foremost, investing in public transportation can significantly reduce traffic congestion and decrease air pollution. With more efficient and reliable public transportation options, people are more likely to leave their cars behind, resulting in fewer vehicles on the road and lower emissions. This not only benefits the environment but also improves the overall quality of life for urban residents who often face congested roads and poor air quality.Another reason why governments should prioritize public transportation is that it provides equal access to transportation for all members of society, regardless of income or social status. Public transportation is often more affordable than owning and maintaining a car, making it a vital lifeline for low-income individuals, students, and the elderly. By investing in public transportation, governments can promote social equity and ensure that everyone has access to basic necessities like employment, education, and healthcare.On the other hand, spending more money on improving roads and highways can lead to increased traffic volume and urban sprawl, as people are incentivized to drive more and live farther away from city centers. This can result in more pollution, noise, and decreased quality of life. Furthermore, improving roads and highways often benefits only those who own cars, which can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.In conclusion, while improving roads and highways is important, I firmly believe that governments should prioritize investing in public transportation. By doing so, they can promote a more sustainable, equitable, and livable urban environment that benefits everyone, regardless of income or social status.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;When it comes to studying, people have different preferences. While some students prefer to study alone, others prefer to study in a group. As for me, I prefer to study with a group of students. This is because I believe that group study sessions have several benefits that can enhance my learning experience.Firstly, studying in a group allows me to learn from others. When I am studying with a group of students, we can discuss and share our ideas and understanding of the material. This helps me to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, as each person brings their own perspective and insights to the discussion. For example, when I was studying for a math exam, my group members and I worked together to solve problems and explained the concepts to each other. This helped me to understand the material better and retain it longer.Secondly, studying in a group provides motivation and accountability. When I am studying alone, it is easy to get distracted and lose focus. However, when I am studying with a group, we can motivate and encourage each other to stay on track. We can also set goals and deadlines for ourselves, and hold each other accountable for meeting them. For instance, my group members and I set a goal to finish a certain number of practice problems each day, and we checked in with each other daily to make sure we were meeting our goals.Lastly, studying in a group can be more enjoyable and less isolating than studying alone. Studying can be a lonely and tedious experience, especially when done alone. However, when I am studying with a group, we can make the experience more enjoyable by taking breaks together, sharing snacks and drinks, and socializing. This helps to make the experience less isolating and more enjoyable.In conclusion, I prefer to study with a group of students. I believe that group study sessions provide opportunities to learn from others, stay motivated and accountable, and make the experience more enjoyable.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";The impact of human activity on the Earth has been a topic of debate for many years. While some people believe that human activity improves the planet, I strongly agree that our actions are causing irreparable harm to the Earth. In this essay, I will provide reasons and examples to support my opinion.Firstly, human activity is responsible for the rapid depletion of natural resources. The excessive use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and pollution have led to the destruction of ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, and climate change. For instance, the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching, from rising sea levels to extreme weather events.Secondly, human activity has also led to the pollution of our oceans and waterways. The disposal of plastic waste, chemicals, and other pollutants has devastating effects on marine life and human health. According to the United Nations, over 8 million tons of plastic waste enter the world's oceans every year, harming marine life and contaminating the food chain.Lastly, human activity has also led to soil degradation and erosion. The intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture has led to soil pollution, reduced fertility, and decreased crop yields. This not only affects food security but also contributes to climate change.In conclusion, while some may argue that human activity improves the Earth, I firmly believe that our actions are causing irreparable harm to the planet. The depletion of natural resources, pollution of oceans and waterways, and soil degradation are just a few examples of the devastating impact of human activity. It is essential that we take immediate action to reduce our carbon footprint, adopt sustainable practices, and protect the Earth for future generations.
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";The company should choose to protect the environment over supporting the arts. While the arts are a valuable aspect of human culture and provide entertainment and inspiration to society, protecting the environment is a more pressing concern that has far-reaching consequences for the planet and its inhabitants.One of the main reasons why protecting the environment should take precedence is that it is essential for the survival of our planet. Climate change, pollution, and deforestation are just a few of the environmental issues that pose a significant threat to the health and well-being of humans and animals alike. By supporting environmental protection efforts, the company can contribute to the preservation of natural resources, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and conservation of biodiversity.On the other hand, while supporting the arts can bring numerous benefits to society, such as promoting cultural diversity and providing a platform for self-expression, it is not as critical to the immediate survival of the planet. Moreover, the arts can also be supported through other means, such as government funding, donations from individuals, and private patronage.Furthermore, investing in environmental protection can also have long-term economic benefits for the company. For instance, a study by the Harvard Business Review found that companies that prioritize sustainability tend to outperform those that do not. Additionally, consumers are increasingly prioritizing environmental concerns when making purchasing decisions, making it beneficial for companies to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.In conclusion, while both supporting the arts and protecting the environment are valuable pursuits, the company should prioritize the latter due to its critical importance for the survival of our planet and its inhabitants.
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;Title: Essential Characteristics of a Valuable Co-WorkerIn the modern workplace, effective collaboration is crucial for success. Working closely with diverse individuals requires a specific set of skills and traits that foster a productive and harmonious environment. In my opinion, some important characteristics of a co-worker include strong communication skills, adaptability, reliability, and a positive attitude.First and foremost, effective communication is vital in a collaborative setting. A co-worker who can articulate their thoughts and ideas clearly, actively listen, and provide constructive feedback is invaluable. For instance, in a marketing team, a colleague who can clearly explain their design concept can help prevent misunderstandings and ensure a unified vision. This skill enables seamless project execution, reduces errors, and promotes a culture of openness.Adaptability is another essential characteristic of a co-worker. The ability to pivot when faced with unexpected challenges or changes in the project scope is critical in today's fast-paced work environment. A colleague who can adjust to new information, priorities, or timelines can help the team stay on track and meet deadlines. For example, in a software development team, a co-worker who can adapt to a sudden change in project requirements can help the team deliver a quality product on time.Reliability is also a crucial trait in a co-worker. When team members can depend on each other to complete tasks and meet commitments, it builds trust and strengthens the team's overall performance. A colleague who follows through on their promises and maintains a high level of work quality can reduce stress and promote a sense of security within the team. Furthermore, a positive attitude is essential for maintaining a healthy and productive work environment. A co-worker who remains optimistic, even in challenging situations, can boost team morale and encourage collaboration.In conclusion, a valuable co-worker possesses a combination of strong communication skills, adaptability, reliability, and a positive attitude. These characteristics are essential for effective collaboration, adaptability, and overall team success. By working with colleagues who embody these traits, we can achieve our goals, build strong relationships, and create a positive work environment.
202;When people succeed it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success. Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.First, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.Secondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. Thirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. Although it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.;The idea that people succeed solely because of hard work and that luck has no role to play in achieving success is a notion that has been debated extensively. While hard work is undoubtedly a crucial factor in determining one's success, I disagree with the statement that luck has nothing to do with it. In my opinion, luck can often be the catalyst that propels an individual towards achieving their goals.On one hand, it is undeniable that hard work is a fundamental component of success. Dedication, perseverance, and a strong work ethic are essential qualities that contribute to a person's achievements. For instance, individuals like Thomas Edison, who invented the light bulb after thousands of failed attempts, exemplify the importance of hard work in overcoming obstacles and reaching success.On the other hand, luck can also play a significant role in determining one's success. Sometimes, being in the right place at the right time can be the turning point in a person's career or life. For example, J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, was a single mother living on welfare when her book was rejected by twelve publishers. It was only after a small publishing house agreed to publish her book that she achieved immense success. In this case, luck played a significant role in launching her career.Furthermore, many successful entrepreneurs and business leaders attribute their success to a combination of hard work and luck. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, often spoke about the role of luck in his success, stating that being adopted by the right parents and meeting Steve Wozniak at the right time were crucial factors in his journey to success.In conclusion, while hard work is undoubtedly a vital component of success, luck also plays a significant role in achieving one's goals. It is often the combination of both hard work and luck that leads to success, rather than solely one or the other.
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;The notion that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning has been a topic of discussion in recent years. While traditional classroom learning has its benefits, there are compelling reasons to suggest that online learning platforms can be a more effective and efficient way of imparting knowledge.Firstly, online learning provides students with the flexibility to learn at their own pace and convenience. With the rise of digital technology, students can access a vast array of educational resources and courses from anywhere in the world, at any time. This is particularly beneficial for students who have work or family commitments, or those who live in remote areas where access to educational institutions is limited.Another significant advantage of online learning is its ability to cater to different learning styles. Unlike traditional classroom learning, which often follows a one-size-fits-all approach, online platforms can be tailored to meet the individual needs of students. For example, video lectures can be replayed multiple times, allowing students to grasp complex concepts more easily. Moreover, online platforms can incorporate interactive elements, such as quizzes, games, and discussion forums, which can enhance student engagement and motivation.Furthermore, online learning can also reduce costs associated with traditional classroom learning. With no need to commute to a physical location, students can save money on transportation and accommodation costs. Additionally, online platforms can reduce the need for physical infrastructure, such as classrooms and lecture halls, which can be a significant cost-saving measure for educational institutions.However, it is essential to acknowledge that online learning is not without its challenges. Technical issues, such as connectivity problems and poor video quality, can hinder the learning experience. Moreover, online learning requires students to be self-motivated and disciplined, which can be a significant barrier for some students.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, the benefits of distance learning and online computer classes outweigh those of traditional classroom learning. With its flexibility, ability to cater to different learning styles, and cost-effectiveness, online learning platforms have the potential to revolutionize the way we learn and access education.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;When it comes to the debate about whether university students should be required to attend classes or not, I firmly believe that attendance should be mandatory. While some may argue that students are adults and should be given the freedom to choose whether or not to attend classes, I believe that requiring attendance is essential for academic success and personal growth.First and foremost, attending classes is crucial for students to grasp complex concepts and ideas. University professors are experts in their fields, and their lectures provide valuable insights and explanations that students may not get from simply reading textbooks. By attending classes, students can ask questions, engage in discussions, and clarify any doubts they may have, which is essential for understanding and retaining the material. Moreover, attending classes also allows students to interact with their peers, exchange ideas, and learn from one another's experiences.Another reason why I believe attendance should be mandatory is that it helps students develop a sense of responsibility and discipline. By requiring students to attend classes, universities can instill a sense of accountability and commitment to their studies. This, in turn, can help students develop good study habits, time management skills, and a strong work ethic, all of which are essential for success in their future careers.Additionally, attending classes can also provide students with opportunities to engage in extracurricular activities, such as group projects, presentations, and discussions, which are an essential part of the university experience. These activities help students develop important skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, which are highly valued by employers.In conclusion, while some may argue that attendance should be optional, I firmly believe that requiring university students to attend classes is essential for academic success, personal growth, and future career prospects. By attending classes, students can gain valuable knowledge, develop important skills, and form meaningful connections with their peers and professors.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;The debate about whether to live in a small town or a big city has been ongoing for years. While some people prefer the tranquility and close-knit community of a small town, others enjoy the hustle and bustle of a big city. Personally, I would prefer to live in a big city.One of the primary reasons I would choose a big city is the vast array of job opportunities it offers. Cities are hubs of industries, and they provide a wide range of career options, from finance to technology, healthcare, and education. In contrast, small towns often have limited job openings, and the job market may be saturated. Living in a big city would provide me with the chance to explore various career paths and advance in my profession.Another advantage of living in a big city is the access to quality education and healthcare. Cities are often home to top-ranked universities, hospitals, and research institutions, which provide world-class facilities and expertise. This would be particularly beneficial for individuals seeking higher education or specialized medical treatment. Additionally, big cities offer a diverse range of cultural and entertainment options, from museums and theaters to restaurants and sports events.While some may argue that small towns offer a stronger sense of community, I believe that big cities also have their own unique sense of community. Urban areas often have diverse neighborhoods, each with its own distinct character and cultural identity. This diversity fosters a sense of belonging and connection among residents.In conclusion, while small towns have their charm, I believe that big cities offer more opportunities, amenities, and experiences that align with my personal goals and aspirations. The fast-paced and dynamic environment of a big city would provide me with the ideal setting to grow professionally, intellectually, and culturally.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;The mass migration of young people from rural areas to cities is a widespread phenomenon observed in many countries. This trend has sparked intense debate, with various reasons contributing to this movement. In my opinion, the primary drivers behind this shift are the pursuit of better educational opportunities, employment prospects, and a more modern lifestyle.On one hand, rural areas often lack access to quality educational institutions, forcing young people to relocate to cities to pursue higher education. Moreover, cities offer a wider range of job opportunities, especially in specialized fields, which attracts young people seeking employment. The urban lifestyle, with its modern amenities, cultural events, and social diversity, is also a significant draw for many young individuals. These advantages have led to an influx of young people into cities, transforming them into hubs of innovation, entrepreneurship, and progress.On the other hand, this exodus of young people from rural areas has its downsides. The brain drain from rural areas can lead to a shortage of skilled workers, ultimately hindering the development of these regions. Additionally, the increased pressure on urban infrastructure, housing, and services can result in overcrowding, strain on resources, and decreased quality of life.However, I firmly believe that the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages. Cities serve as incubators for ideas, innovation, and creativity, driving economic growth and societal progress. The diversity and cultural exchange that cities offer are invaluable in fostering a more open-minded and tolerant society. Furthermore, the influx of young people into cities can lead to the revitalization of urban areas, as they bring fresh perspectives and energy to these environments.In conclusion, the migration of young people from rural areas to cities is driven by the pursuit of better educational and employment opportunities, as well as a more modern lifestyle. While this trend has its drawbacks, I believe that the advantages of urbanization, including innovation, diversity, and economic growth, outweigh the disadvantages.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;I strongly agree with the statement that high school students should take a course on basic economics. In today's fast-paced and increasingly complex world, understanding economics is crucial for individuals to navigate their financial lives, make informed decisions, and participate actively in the global economy.Firstly, a course on basic economics would equip high school students with the knowledge and skills necessary to manage their personal finances effectively. By learning about budgeting, saving, and investing, students would be better prepared to make smart financial decisions, such as choosing a college major, planning for retirement, and avoiding debt.Secondly, a basic economics course would provide students with a deeper understanding of the world around them. By studying the principles of supply and demand, inflation, and globalization, students would gain insight into the ways in which economic systems function and impact society. This would enable them to critically evaluate news and current events, making them more informed and engaged citizens.Thirdly, a basic economics course would also prepare students for their future careers. In an increasingly globalized economy, understanding economic concepts and principles is essential for success in a wide range of fields, from business and finance to government and international relations. By introducing economics early on, high school students would be better equipped to pursue careers in these fields and make meaningful contributions to their communities.In conclusion, I firmly believe that high school students should take a course on basic economics. By providing students with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate their financial lives, understand the world around them, and prepare for their future careers, a basic economics course would be a valuable addition to any high school curriculum.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;"I disagree with the notion that university education should be restricted to the very best academic students. While it is essential to maintain academic standards, limiting higher education to only the most academically gifted students would be detrimental to society and individual development.Firstly, intelligence and academic ability are not the only factors that determine a person's potential. Many students who may not excel academically have exceptional skills in other areas, such as creativity, entrepreneurship, or leadership. By restricting university access, we risk denying opportunities to individuals who could make significant contributions in various fields.Moreover, university education is not just about academics; it is also about personal growth, socialization, and developing essential life skills. By allowing a large proportion of young people to access higher education, we provide them with a platform to develop their critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are crucial in today's fast-paced and interconnected world.Furthermore, limiting university access would exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds often face barriers in accessing quality education, and restricting university access would further widen the gap. This would result in a perpetuation of social stratification, where only the privileged few have access to better opportunities.Instead of restricting access, universities should focus on providing support systems and resources to help students from diverse backgrounds succeed. This could include mentorship programs, academic support services, and scholarships. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and equitable education system that values diversity and promotes social mobility.In conclusion, while academic standards are important, restricting university education to only the very best academic students would be counterproductive. It is essential to provide opportunities for a large proportion of young people to access higher education, as it promotes personal growth, socialization, and development of essential life skills, ultimately leading to a more inclusive and equitable society."
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The age-old adage ""prevention is better than cure"" has been a guiding principle in the field of healthcare for centuries. The notion that a significant portion of a country's health budget should be allocated towards health education and preventative measures rather than treatment is a contentious issue. In my opinion, I largely agree with this statement, and here's why.First and foremost, prevention is indeed better than cure. By investing in health education and preventative measures, a country can significantly reduce the incidence of diseases, thereby alleviating the burden on its healthcare system. For instance, promoting healthy lifestyles, providing vaccination programs, and conducting regular health check-ups can help prevent the onset of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. This not only saves lives but also reduces the economic burden of treating these diseases.Moreover, preventative measures are often more cost-effective than treatment. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), every dollar invested in prevention can save up to three dollars in treatment costs. This is particularly relevant in low- and middle-income countries where resources are limited, and the healthcare system is already overwhelmed.However, it is essential to strike a balance between prevention and treatment. Diverting a large proportion of the health budget towards prevention might compromise the quality of treatment services, particularly for those already afflicted with diseases. A balanced approach would be to allocate a significant portion of the budget towards prevention while ensuring that treatment services are not compromised.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that a large proportion of a country's health budget should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. By doing so, a country can reduce the incidence of diseases, alleviate the burden on its healthcare system, and ultimately, save lives and resources."
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;The pressure on young people to succeed academically has been a topic of concern in recent years. Some argue that non-academic subjects such as physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus to allow students to focus solely on academic subjects. However, I disagree with this notion.While it is true that academic success is important, it is not the only aspect of a well-rounded education. Non-academic subjects play a vital role in the development of students' physical, emotional, and social skills. Physical education, for example, helps students maintain a healthy lifestyle, develop teamwork skills, and build confidence. Cookery, on the other hand, teaches students essential life skills such as meal planning, budgeting, and nutrition. These skills are essential for independent living and cannot be replaced by academic subjects alone.Moreover, removing non-academic subjects from the syllabus would have a negative impact on students' mental health and wellbeing. Research has shown that physical activity and creative pursuits have a positive impact on mental health, reducing stress and anxiety levels. By removing these subjects, schools would be taking away valuable opportunities for students to unwind and recharge.Furthermore, a narrow focus on academic subjects would lead to a lack of diversity in the curriculum, resulting in students being ill-prepared for the demands of the real world. Employers and universities are not just looking for students with high grades, but also those with practical skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities, which non-academic subjects provide.In conclusion, while academic success is important, it is not the only aspect of a well-rounded education. Non-academic subjects such as physical education and cookery play a vital role in the development of students' physical, emotional, and social skills. Rather than removing these subjects from the syllabus, schools should aim to strike a balance between academic and non-academic subjects to provide students with a holistic education.
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When individuals migrate to a new country, they are often faced with the decision of whether to adopt the customs of their new home or maintain their own cultural traditions. This dilemma can have significant implications for their social integration, personal identity, and overall well-being. In this essay, I will compare the two options and argue that maintaining one's own customs is the preferred choice.On the one hand, adopting the customs of the new country can facilitate social integration and ease the transition into the new society. By embracing local traditions, immigrants can build relationships with native-born citizens, improve their language skills, and gain a deeper understanding of the local culture. For instance, a Chinese immigrant who celebrates American holidays like Thanksgiving and Halloween may find it easier to connect with their American colleagues and neighbors. However, this approach can also lead to cultural assimilation, where individuals abandon their own heritage and risk losing their sense of identity.On the other hand, maintaining one's own customs allows immigrants to preserve their cultural heritage and maintain a strong sense of identity. By continuing to observe their own traditions, individuals can stay connected to their roots and pass on their cultural values to future generations. For example, a Mexican immigrant who celebrates the Day of the Dead (Día de Muertos) can share this meaningful tradition with their children and grandchildren, teaching them about their ancestors and cultural heritage. Moreover, maintaining one's own customs can also enrich the cultural diversity of the new country, as different traditions and practices are introduced and shared with the wider community.In conclusion, while adopting the customs of the new country can facilitate social integration, I believe that maintaining one's own customs is the preferred choice. By preserving their cultural heritage, individuals can maintain a strong sense of identity, stay connected to their roots, and contribute to the cultural diversity of their new home.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;In today's interconnected world, the ability to work effectively in a team or independently is crucial for success. While both skills are valuable, I firmly believe that being able to work with a group of people on a team is more important. Here's why.Firstly, teamwork is essential in most workplaces. In a team setting, individuals with diverse skills and expertise come together to achieve a common goal. This collaborative approach fosters creativity, innovation, and problem-solving. For instance, in a software development company, a team of designers, developers, and project managers work together to design and deliver a product. Each member brings their unique perspective, and the collective effort leads to a better outcome.Secondly, working in a team helps individuals develop essential soft skills, such as communication, conflict resolution, and time management. When team members work together, they learn to communicate effectively, resolve conflicts, and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines. These skills are transferable across various industries and are highly valued by employers.Moreover, teamwork promotes a sense of accountability and motivation. When individuals work together towards a common goal, they are more likely to stay motivated and committed to the project. For example, in a research project, team members can divide tasks, share findings, and provide feedback, which helps to maintain momentum and enthusiasm.In contrast, while working independently has its benefits, such as allowing for focused work and reducing distractions, it can also lead to isolation and stagnation. Independent workers may miss out on the diverse perspectives and ideas that a team setting provides.In conclusion, while both teamwork and independent work have their advantages, I firmly believe that being able to work with a group of people on a team is more important. Teamwork promotes creativity, develops essential soft skills, and fosters accountability and motivation. In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, the ability to work effectively in a team is crucial for success in most industries.
213;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Use examples and specific reasons to support your position.;Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.First of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.Furthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. Lastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. To conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.;I strongly agree with the statement that smoking should not be permitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Smoking in enclosed public spaces, such as restaurants, poses significant health risks to non-smokers, including patrons and employees.Firstly, secondhand smoke, also known as passive smoke, contains over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic and cancer-causing. When smokers light up in restaurants, they not only put their own health at risk but also that of those around them. Studies have consistently shown that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory problems. By prohibiting smoking in restaurants, state laws can effectively reduce the number of people exposed to secondhand smoke and minimize the risk of smoking-related illnesses.Secondly, smoking in restaurants can also negatively impact the dining experience for non-smokers. Smoke can be a nuisance, causing discomfort and distraction for those trying to enjoy their meals. Furthermore, smoke can linger in the air and on surfaces, leaving an unpleasant odor and residue. By banning smoking in restaurants, patrons can enjoy a smoke-free environment, which can lead to a more pleasant and enjoyable dining experience.Finally, upholding state laws that prohibit smoking in restaurants can also have economic benefits. Many restaurants have reported increased business and customer satisfaction since implementing smoke-free policies. Additionally, smoke-free environments can also reduce maintenance and cleaning costs, as well as minimize the risk of fires and property damage.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. The health risks associated with secondhand smoke, the negative impact on the dining experience, and the economic benefits of smoke-free environments all support this position. By prioritizing the health and well-being of patrons and employees, restaurants can create a safer and more enjoyable environment for everyone.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";Engaging in hobbies and physical activities that are distinct from one's work can be incredibly beneficial for an individual's overall well-being. Having diverse pursuits outside of work can help maintain a healthy work-life balance, prevent professional burnout, and foster personal growth.When people engage in activities unrelated to their job, they are able to tap into different aspects of their personality, explore new passions, and express themselves in ways that may not be possible in their professional lives. For instance, a software engineer might find solace in painting, allowing them to express their creativity in a more artistic manner. This diversity in pursuits can help keep the mind engaged and prevent the monotony of routine, making life more enjoyable and fulfilling.Moreover, participating in activities that are vastly different from one's work can also promote skill transfer. Skills learned in one domain can often be applied to another, enhancing problem-solving abilities, creativity, and adaptability. For example, a musician might develop discipline and time management skills that can be applied to their work as an accountant.Furthermore, engaging in diverse hobbies and physical activities can also have a positive impact on mental and physical health. Exercise, in particular, has been shown to reduce stress, improve mood, and increase energy levels. Pursuing activities that bring joy and excitement can also boost self-esteem and overall life satisfaction.In conclusion, it is essential for individuals to have hobbies and engage in physical activities that differ significantly from their work. By doing so, people can maintain a healthy work-life balance, prevent burnout, and foster personal growth. Embracing diverse pursuits can also promote skill transfer, improve mental and physical health, and enhance overall well-being.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;The debate on whether governments should prioritize spending on improving roads and highways or public transportation has been ongoing for years. In my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation. This approach offers numerous benefits that align with the needs of modern society.One of the primary reasons for investing in public transportation is its positive impact on the environment. With the growing concern of climate change, it is crucial to reduce our reliance on personal vehicles, which are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Public transportation, such as buses and trains, can efficiently transport large numbers of people, resulting in a substantial decrease in emissions. For instance, a single bus can take up to 40 cars off the road, leading to a considerable reduction in air pollution.Another advantage of investing in public transportation is its potential to alleviate traffic congestion. By providing citizens with reliable and efficient public transportation options, governments can encourage people to leave their cars behind, reducing the number of vehicles on the road. This, in turn, can decrease travel times, making commutes faster and more convenient. Furthermore, improved public transportation systems can also boost local economies by facilitating easier access to employment, education, and shopping centers.On the other hand, investing in roads and highways may provide temporary relief from traffic congestion, but it does not address the root cause of the problem. In fact, research has shown that expanding road capacity can often lead to increased traffic volumes, as more people are incentivized to drive. This phenomenon, known as induced demand, can negate the initial benefits of improved roads, making them a less sustainable solution in the long run.In conclusion, governments should prioritize spending on improving public transportation over roads and highways. This approach offers a more sustainable, environmentally-friendly, and efficient solution to our transportation needs. By investing in public transportation, governments can create a better future for their citizens, while also contributing to a more environmentally conscious world.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;When it comes to learning about life, people have different opinions on the best approach. Some believe that seeking advice from family and friends is the most effective way, while others argue that personal experience is the best teacher. In this essay, we will compare the advantages of these two approaches and determine which one is preferable.On the one hand, seeking advice from family and friends has several benefits. For instance, they can offer valuable insights and guidance based on their own experiences, helping us avoid common pitfalls and make informed decisions. Moreover, they can provide emotional support and encouragement, which can boost our confidence and motivation. Additionally, advice from loved ones can be tailored to our individual needs and circumstances, making it more relevant and useful.On the other hand, learning through personal experience has its own advantages. By experiencing life firsthand, we can develop our own judgment and decision-making skills, which are essential for independence and self-reliance. Moreover, personal experience can foster resilience, adaptability, and creativity, as we learn to navigate challenges and overcome obstacles. Furthermore, personal experience can be a powerful teacher, as we learn from our own mistakes and successes.In conclusion, while seeking advice from family and friends has its benefits, I believe that personal experience is the preferable way of learning about life. Personal experience allows us to develop our own skills, judgment, and character, which are essential for long-term growth and success. While advice from loved ones can be valuable, it should be used as a supplement to, rather than a substitute for, personal experience. Ultimately, the best way to learn about life is through a combination of both approaches, where we seek guidance from others while also taking the initiative to learn and grow through our own experiences.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;"The statement ""childhood is the happiest time of a person's life"" is a topic of much debate. While some may argue that childhood is indeed the happiest time, others may disagree. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement.On one hand, childhood is often associated with a carefree and innocent period of life. Children are not burdened with the same responsibilities and worries as adults, allowing them to focus on play, learning, and exploration. Their imagination and creativity are at their peak, and they are able to experience the world around them with a sense of wonder and curiosity. Moreover, children are often surrounded by loving family members and caregivers, who provide them with a sense of security and support.On the other hand, childhood is not always a happy time for everyone. Some children may experience difficulties such as poverty, bullying, or family problems, which can make their childhood a challenging and unhappy time. Additionally, the pressures of modern society, such as academic expectations and social media, can also impact a child's happiness.Furthermore, happiness is a subjective experience that can vary greatly from person to person. What makes one person happy may not be the same for another. While some people may look back on their childhood as the happiest time of their life, others may find happiness in other stages of their life, such as young adulthood or later life.In conclusion, while childhood can be a happy and carefree time for many people, it is not universally the happiest time of a person's life. Individual experiences and circumstances can greatly impact a person's happiness, and it is unfair to make a blanket statement that applies to everyone."
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;The advent of modern food preparation methods has undoubtedly transformed the way people live. With the proliferation of convenience foods, meal kits, and innovative cooking appliances, preparing meals has become significantly easier and faster. In this essay, we will explore how this change has improved the way people live, highlighting specific reasons and examples to support this argument.One of the primary benefits of easier food preparation is the significant time-saving it offers. With the availability of pre-cut ingredients, microwaveable meals, and slow cookers, individuals can now allocate more time to other aspects of their lives, such as work, leisure activities, or personal development. For instance, working parents can quickly prepare a nutritious meal for their families, rather than spending hours in the kitchen. This, in turn, has led to a better work-life balance, reducing stress and increasing overall well-being.Furthermore, the ease of food preparation has also led to a more diverse and experimental approach to cooking. With the rise of meal kits and online recipe platforms, people are now more inclined to try new cuisines and flavors, broadening their culinary horizons. This increased exposure to different cultures and cooking techniques has fostered a more adventurous and open-minded attitude towards food, ultimately enriching people's lives.Additionally, the convenience of modern food preparation has also made healthy eating more accessible. Pre-washed greens, pre-cut vegetables, and lean protein sources have made it easier for individuals to incorporate nutritious meals into their busy lifestyles. This, in turn, has contributed to a decline in diet-related health issues, such as obesity and diabetes, promoting a healthier population.In conclusion, the ease of food preparation has undoubtedly improved the way people live. By saving time, promoting culinary diversity, and facilitating healthy eating, modern food preparation methods have enhanced overall well-being, lifestyle, and health. As the food industry continues to evolve, it is likely that these benefits will only continue to grow, making life easier, healthier, and more enjoyable for individuals worldwide.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;The age-old debate about when young adults should gain independence from their parents has sparked intense discussion among scholars and the general public alike. While some young adults yearn for independence as soon as possible, others prefer to live with their families for a longer period. In my opinion, living with family for a longer time is the better option, and here's why.On one hand, living with family provides emotional support and stability, which are crucial for young adults as they navigate the challenges of transitioning into adulthood. For instance, many students who live with their families during college or university report lower stress levels and better academic performance compared to those who live alone. This is because they have a support system that helps them cope with the pressures of higher education.On the other hand, living with family also provides financial benefits. With the rising costs of living, it's becoming increasingly difficult for young adults to afford basic necessities like rent, food, and transportation. By living with their families, they can save money on these expenses and allocate it towards more important goals, such as paying off student loans or building an emergency fund.Furthermore, living with family for a longer time also allows young adults to develop important life skills, such as cooking, cleaning, and time management. These skills are essential for independent living, and by learning them in a supportive environment, young adults can make a smoother transition into adulthood.In conclusion, while some young adults may prefer to gain independence as soon as possible, I believe that living with family for a longer time is the better option. It provides emotional support, financial benefits, and an opportunity to develop important life skills. By living with their families, young adults can set themselves up for success and make a more seamless transition into adulthood.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;I disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Zoos have been a cornerstone of wildlife conservation, education, and research for centuries, and their importance cannot be overstated. Despite the criticisms, many zoos have evolved to prioritize animal welfare and contribute significantly to the protection of endangered species.One of the primary purposes of zoos is to support conservation efforts. For instance, the San Diego Zoo's breeding program for giant pandas has contributed to the increase of the species' population in the wild. Similarly, the Zoological Wildlife Foundation's reintroduction program for black-footed ferrets has helped to reestablish the species in its natural habitat. These programs not only help to stabilize populations but also raise awareness about the plight of these species.Zoos also play a vital role in education and research. By providing a controlled environment for scientists to study animal behavior, physiology, and psychology, zoos facilitate groundbreaking research that informs conservation strategies and improves animal care. Furthermore, zoos offer a unique opportunity for the general public to engage with wildlife, promoting empathy, understanding, and appreciation for the natural world. Many zoos have incorporated interactive exhibits, educational programs, and community outreach initiatives to inspire the next generation of conservationists.While some zoos may prioritize entertainment over animal welfare, many institutions have made significant strides in improving living conditions and providing naturalistic habitats. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) has established rigorous accreditation standards, ensuring that member zoos meet stringent criteria for animal care, welfare, and conservation.In conclusion, zoos are not mere relics of the past but dynamic institutions that contribute to the conservation of species, advance scientific knowledge, and inspire a love for wildlife. As the world grapples with the biodiversity crisis, the role of zoos in protecting and preserving our planet's precious species is more critical than ever.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;The notion that parents are the best teachers for young children has been a longstanding debate among educationists and child development experts. While some argue that parents play a crucial role in shaping their children's early learning experiences, others contend that formal education and external influences are equally, if not more, important. In this essay, I will examine the extent to which I agree or disagree with the statement.On the one hand, parents are indeed the first and most significant teachers for young children. They provide a nurturing environment that fosters emotional, social, and cognitive development. Parents are responsible for instilling values, morals, and cultural norms, laying the foundation for their children's future academic success. Moreover, parents are uniquely positioned to tailor their teaching to their child's individual needs, interests, and learning style. For instance, they can encourage a love for reading by reading together, or promote social skills by engaging in play.On the other hand, I disagree that parents are the only, or even the best, teachers for young children. Formal education and external influences can provide children with a broader range of experiences, skills, and knowledge. Teachers and caregivers in daycare centers, preschools, and kindergartens are trained professionals who can offer specialized instruction, socialization opportunities, and exposure to diverse environments. Furthermore, formal education can provide children with access to resources, such as libraries, technology, and educational materials, that may not be available at home.In conclusion, while I agree that parents play a vital role in their children's early education, I also recognize the importance of formal education and external influences. Parents are the best teachers in the sense that they provide a foundation for future learning, but they should be supplemented by, rather than replaced with, formal education and external experiences. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines parental involvement with formal education will best support the holistic development of young children.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;The impact of television on young children has been a topic of discussion for many years. While some people believe that television has a negative influence on young minds, others argue that it can be a valuable tool for learning and entertainment. In this essay, I will discuss the extent to which I agree with the statement that television has a bad influence on young children.On one hand, it is undeniable that excessive television viewing can have a negative impact on young children. Watching too much television can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health problems. Furthermore, exposure to violent or mature content on television can be detrimental to a child's emotional and psychological well-being. Children may imitate the aggressive behavior they see on screen, and it can also desensitize them to violence. Moreover, excessive television viewing can lead to a decrease in physical activity, social interaction, and cognitive development.On the other hand, television can also have a positive influence on young children when used responsibly. Educational programs such as Sesame Street, Blue's Clues, and Dora the Explorer can be highly beneficial for a child's cognitive and language development. These shows promote learning, social skills, and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, television can provide a window to the world, exposing children to different cultures, traditions, and ways of life. It can also serve as a tool for teaching children important values such as empathy, kindness, and self-discipline.In conclusion, I agree that television can have a bad influence on young children if not monitored and controlled. However, when used in moderation and with a careful selection of content, television can be a valuable tool for learning and entertainment. Parents and caregivers should be aware of the potential risks and take steps to ensure that television viewing is a positive and enriching experience for young children.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;I disagree with the notion that businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. While job security is a desirable aspect of employment, lifelong employment contracts can have negative consequences for both employees and employers.On the one hand, lifelong employment can lead to stagnation and complacency among employees. Without the motivation to continually develop new skills and adapt to changing industry demands, employees may become less productive and innovative over time. For instance, Japan's traditional lifetime employment system has been criticized for creating a culture of seniority-based promotion, where employees are often rewarded for loyalty rather than performance. This can result in inefficient allocation of human resources, as less capable employees are retained simply due to their tenure.On the other hand, lifelong employment contracts can also limit an employer's ability to respond to changing market conditions. In a rapidly evolving business environment, companies need to be agile and adaptable to remain competitive. By committing to employ staff for life, businesses may be unable to restructure or downsize in response to shifts in demand or technological advancements. For example, the decline of the manufacturing industry in the US was exacerbated by the inability of companies to shed excess labor, due to generous severance packages and union agreements.Furthermore, lifelong employment contracts can also limit an individual's career aspirations and personal goals. In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, many employees value flexibility, autonomy, and the opportunity to explore different industries and roles. By committing to a single employer for life, individuals may miss out on valuable experiences and opportunities for growth.In conclusion, while job security is an important aspect of employment, lifelong employment contracts are not in the best interest of either employees or employers. A more balanced approach, which prioritizes flexibility, skill development, and adaptability, is more likely to drive innovation, productivity, and personal growth.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";"Childhood is often regarded as a magical and idyllic period in one's life, filled with wonder, curiosity, and joy. The statement that ""Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life"" resonates with many, but in my opinion, it is a subjective assertion that does not hold true for everyone. While some people may indeed look back on their childhood as a carefree and blissful era, others may have experienced trauma, neglect, or difficulties that contradict this notion.On one hand, childhood is a time when imagination and creativity are at their peak. Children's minds are like sponges, soaking up new experiences and learning at an incredible rate. The simple pleasures in life, such as playing with friends, exploring nature, or enjoying family traditions, can bring immense happiness to children. For instance, many people cherish memories of birthday parties, vacations, or family gatherings, which evoke feelings of joy and contentment.On the other hand, many children face challenges that can overshadow their childhood experiences. Poverty, bullying, and family conflicts can lead to anxiety, depression, and a sense of insecurity. According to UNICEF, millions of children worldwide are subjected to child labor, exploitation, and violence, which can leave lasting emotional scars. For these children, childhood is not a happy time, but a struggle to survive.Moreover, the notion of happiness is relative and can vary greatly across cultures and individual experiences. What one person considers a happy childhood, another person may not. Personal values, cultural norms, and socioeconomic factors can all influence one's perception of happiness.In conclusion, while childhood can be a happy time for some, it is not universally so. The complexities of life, individual experiences, and societal factors all contribute to the fact that childhood is not always the happiest time of a person's life."
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";I disagree with the statement that learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. In fact, understanding the past is essential to navigating the complexities of the present and building a better future.One of the primary reasons for studying the past is that it provides valuable lessons that can be applied to contemporary issues. History is replete with examples of successes and failures, which can serve as a guide for decision-making in the present. For instance, the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, is often cited as a cautionary tale about the dangers of imposing harsh penalties on defeated nations, as it contributed to the rise of Nazi Germany and the outbreak of World War II. By learning from this historical event, policymakers can avoid repeating the same mistakes and create more effective strategies for maintaining peace and stability.Moreover, studying the past allows us to appreciate the progress that has been made in various fields, such as science, technology, and human rights. By examining the achievements and challenges of previous generations, we can gain a deeper understanding of the present and the opportunities that lie ahead. For example, the civil rights movement in the United States, led by figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., paved the way for significant advances in racial equality and social justice. By learning about these struggles and triumphs, we can better comprehend the ongoing quest for equality and justice in our own time.Furthermore, history has a profound impact on our cultural identity and sense of community. By learning about the past, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the traditions, customs, and values that shape our societies. This, in turn, can foster a sense of shared heritage and collective memory, which is essential for building strong, cohesive communities.In conclusion, learning about the past is not only valuable but also essential for those of us living in the present. By studying history, we can gain valuable insights into the complexities of the present, appreciate the progress that has been made, and foster a deeper sense of cultural identity and community.
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;The investment in space exploration by governments has been a topic of debate for decades. While some argue that the funds could be better spent on pressing issues on Earth, I firmly believe that the investment is reasonable and justified.First and foremost, space exploration has led to numerous breakthroughs in technology that have greatly benefited society. The development of GPS, satellite communications, and weather forecasting are just a few examples of the many innovations that have resulted from space research. These technologies have improved our daily lives, enabled global communication, and saved countless lives through early warnings of natural disasters. The benefits of these advancements far outweigh the costs of space exploration.Moreover, space exploration has the potential to provide solutions to some of humanity's most pressing challenges, such as resource depletion and climate change. By exploring and understanding our solar system, we may uncover new sources of energy, minerals, and other essential resources that can sustain human civilization. For instance, NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface, which could provide a stepping stone for further exploration and potential resource extraction.Another reason why the investment in space exploration is reasonable is that it inspires future generations to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The excitement and curiosity sparked by space exploration have motivated many young people to become scientists, engineers, and innovators, driving progress and innovation in various fields.Finally, the investment in space exploration is a long-term strategy that can yield significant returns in the future. As our understanding of the universe expands, so do the possibilities for human advancement. The discovery of exoplanets, for example, raises hopes for the possibility of human settlement and expansion beyond Earth.In conclusion, while the costs of space exploration may seem high, the benefits to society, the potential solutions to global challenges, and the inspiration it provides to future generations make the investment reasonable and worthwhile.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";The notion that television has destroyed communication among friends and family has been a subject of debate for many years. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement as there are valid reasons to support this claim, but there are also instances where television can facilitate communication.On one hand, excessive television watching can indeed hinder face-to-face communication among friends and family. When people spend most of their time watching TV, they tend to isolate themselves from social interactions, leading to a decline in meaningful conversations. For instance, a family might gather in the living room, but instead of engaging in conversations, they are glued to the screen, watching their favorite shows or sports events. This can lead to a lack of emotional intimacy and deep connections among family members.Moreover, television can also create a culture of passive communication, where individuals prefer to watch and listen rather than actively engage in conversations. This can be particularly problematic for children, who learn communication skills by observing and interacting with their family members. If they spend most of their time watching TV, they may not develop essential communication skills, such as active listening, empathy, and conflict resolution.On the other hand, television can also facilitate communication among friends and family in certain ways. For example, watching a favorite TV show or sports event can provide a common topic of conversation, bringing people together and encouraging discussions. Additionally, some TV programs, such as documentaries or educational shows, can stimulate interesting conversations and debates, promoting critical thinking and learning.In conclusion, while I agree that excessive television watching can hinder communication among friends and family, I also believe that television can facilitate communication in certain instances. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to maintain a balance between TV watching and social interactions, ensuring that they prioritize meaningful conversations and connections with their loved ones.
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;"The age-old adage ""to err is human"" reminds us that mistakes are an inevitable part of life. When it comes to friendships, the decision to intervene or let a friend make a mistake can be a difficult one. In my opinion, I agree that letting a friend make a mistake is often better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Firstly, taking action to prevent a mistake can come across as intrusive or controlling, potentially damaging the trust and respect that underpin a healthy friendship. For instance, if a friend is considering a questionable financial investment, jumping in to stop them may be perceived as meddling, even if the intention is good. By letting them make the mistake, they will at least have the autonomy to learn from their error, and you will avoid straining the relationship.Secondly, mistakes are an essential part of the learning process. By letting a friend make a mistake, you are allowing them to develop problem-solving skills, take responsibility for their actions, and gain valuable experience. For example, if a friend is struggling with a difficult decision, stepping in to make the choice for them may deprive them of the opportunity to weigh the pros and cons, and ultimately, grow as a person.Of course, there are exceptions, such as situations where the mistake could have severe consequences, like physical harm or long-term damage. In such cases, it is essential to intervene to prevent harm. However, in most cases, letting a friend make a mistake is better than risking the friendship. By doing so, you are showing trust in their ability to learn from their errors and respecting their autonomy.In conclusion, while it may be challenging to watch a friend make a mistake, it is often better to let them learn from their errors than to risk damaging the friendship by intervening."
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;The transition from adolescence to adulthood can be a daunting experience for many teenagers. As they navigate this critical phase of development, it is essential for parents to provide guidance and support to prepare them for the challenges of adult life. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is by encouraging teenagers to take on a part-time job.Having a part-time job can equip teenagers with a range of valuable skills that are essential for success in adulthood. For instance, it teaches them the importance of time management, responsibility, and self-discipline. By balancing work and school commitments, teenagers learn to prioritize tasks, set goals, and work towards achieving them. Moreover, a part-time job provides an opportunity for teenagers to develop social skills, such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution, which are crucial for building strong relationships in personal and professional life.Furthermore, having a part-time job can help teenagers develop a sense of financial literacy and independence. Earning their own money enables them to make informed decisions about budgeting, saving, and spending, which are essential life skills. It also allows them to take ownership of their financial decisions, reducing their reliance on parents and fostering a sense of self-reliance.In addition, a part-time job can broaden a teenager's perspective and expose them to new experiences, people, and environments. It can help them discover their passions and interests, and inform their future career choices. Many teenagers who work part-time during their teenage years go on to secure better job prospects and higher salaries in their chosen careers.In conclusion, encouraging teenagers to take on a part-time job is one of the best ways parents can prepare them for adult life. It provides a platform for them to develop essential life skills, gain financial literacy, and broaden their horizons. By supporting their children in securing a part-time job, parents can give them the tools and confidence they need to succeed in adulthood.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;Growing up in the countryside or a big city has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. While some may argue that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside, I disagree with this notion.On one hand, the countryside offers a more peaceful and serene environment, away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Children can enjoy the outdoors, explore nature, and develop a strong connection with the environment. They can also benefit from the close-knit community and strong social bonds that are often found in rural areas.However, big cities offer a wide range of opportunities that are not available in the countryside. Cities are hubs of education, culture, and innovation, providing children with access to better schools, libraries, museums, and other resources that can help them develop their skills and interests. Moreover, cities are often more diverse and multicultural, exposing children to different cultures, traditions, and ways of life, which can broaden their perspectives and help them become more open-minded and tolerant individuals.In addition, big cities are often equipped with better healthcare facilities and services, which are essential for children's health and well-being. They also offer a wider range of extracurricular activities and sports facilities, which can help children develop their physical and mental abilities.While the countryside may offer a more peaceful environment, I believe that the benefits of growing up in a big city far outweigh the advantages of rural life. Cities provide children with the opportunities, resources, and diversity that are essential for their growth, development, and success.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;The notion that parents are the best teachers is a widely debated topic. While some people firmly believe that parents play the most significant role in shaping their children's knowledge and character, others argue that this responsibility should be shared among various educators. In my opinion, I agree that parents are indeed the best teachers, and here's why.Firstly, parents have a unique understanding of their child's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style. They can tailor their teaching approach to cater to their child's individual needs, making the learning process more effective and enjoyable. For instance, a parent who recognizes that their child is a visual learner can use visual aids and hands-on activities to help them grasp complex concepts.Secondly, parents have a profound influence on their child's moral and social development. They are the first role models that children look up to, and their values, attitudes, and behaviors are often emulated. Parents can instill important life skills such as empathy, honesty, and responsibility, which are essential for a child's emotional and social growth.Thirdly, parents are always available to provide guidance and support whenever their child needs it. Unlike teachers who may have to cater to a large number of students, parents can devote their undivided attention to their child, providing immediate feedback and encouragement. For example, a parent can help their child with their homework, provide emotional support during difficult times, and celebrate their achievements.In conclusion, while teachers and other educators play a significant role in a child's educational journey, parents are indeed the best teachers. Their unique understanding of their child, profound influence on their moral and social development, and availability to provide guidance and support make them the most effective educators. By working in tandem with other educators, parents can provide their children with a well-rounded education that extends beyond the classroom.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;The advent of convenient food preparation has revolutionized the way people live. With the proliferation of ready-to-eat meals, meal kits, and cooking appliances, individuals can now save time and effort in preparing their daily meals. This shift has had a significant impact on modern life, and in my opinion, it has improved the way people live.Firstly, the increased accessibility of easy-to-prepare food has enabled individuals to allocate their time more efficiently. Gone are the days when people had to spend hours in the kitchen, slaving away over intricate recipes. With the availability of pre-cut ingredients, microwaveable meals, and instant noodles, people can now quickly prepare a meal and dedicate their time to more important pursuits. For instance, working professionals can now focus on their careers, while parents can devote more time to their children's upbringing.Secondly, convenient food preparation has also improved the quality of life for people with busy lifestyles. The rise of meal delivery services and online grocery shopping has made it possible for individuals to access healthy and nutritious food without having to physically visit a market or grocery store. This is particularly beneficial for those who lead hectic lives, such as students, entrepreneurs, and athletes, who require a balanced diet to maintain their energy levels.Lastly, the ease of food preparation has also enabled people to explore different cuisines and flavors, broadening their culinary horizons. With the availability of international ready-to-eat meals and online recipes, individuals can now experience a wide range of flavors and cooking techniques without having to invest significant time and effort.In conclusion, the shift towards convenient food preparation has undoubtedly improved the way people live. It has enabled individuals to allocate their time more efficiently, improved the quality of life for those with busy lifestyles, and broadened culinary horizons. As the world becomes increasingly fast-paced, the importance of convenient food preparation will only continue to grow.
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The question of whether students should be required to take regular standardized tests has been a topic of debate among educators and policymakers for years. While some argue that these tests are an essential tool for measuring student learning and holding schools accountable, others claim that they are a source of undue stress and a narrowing of the curriculum.On the one hand, standardized tests can provide valuable information about student learning. By administering these tests regularly, educators can identify areas where students may be struggling and target their instruction to better meet their needs. Standardized tests can also provide a common metric for comparing student performance across different schools and districts, which can help to identify schools that may be in need of additional support. Furthermore, standardized tests can help to ensure that students are meeting the minimum standards set by their state or district, which can help to ensure that they are prepared for success in college or the workforce.On the other hand, there are also potential drawbacks to requiring students to take regular standardized tests. For example, the high-stakes nature of these tests can lead to a narrowing of the curriculum, as teachers may feel pressure to focus their instruction on test preparation rather than on providing a well-rounded education. Additionally, the stress and anxiety caused by these tests can be overwhelming for some students, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.However, the benefits of standardized tests, such as identifying areas where students need help, providing a comparison metric for schools, and ensuring students are meeting certain standards, outweigh the drawbacks. Moreover, modern standardized tests are designed to test not only knowledge, but also skills that are needed to be successful in life such as critical thinking and problem-solving.In conclusion, students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning. The benefits of these tests, such as providing valuable information about student learning and holding schools accountable, outweigh the potential drawbacks. By using these tests in a way that is balanced and fair, educators can ensure that students are receiving the education they need to succeed in college and beyond.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";The notion that a university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that it is a fundamental right, others claim that it is an unsustainable and unaffordable luxury. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and provide my stance on this contentious issue.On one hand, there are compelling arguments in favor of providing free university education. Firstly, education is a fundamental human right, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. By making university education free, governments can ensure that every citizen has an equal opportunity to acquire knowledge and skills, regardless of their financial background. This, in turn, can lead to a more informed and educated population, which is essential for the development of a country. Moreover, free education can help to bridge the socio-economic divide, as it would enable students from disadvantaged backgrounds to compete on a level playing field with their more affluent peers.On the other hand, there are also valid concerns about the feasibility of providing free university education. Governments would need to bear the significant costs of funding universities, which could divert resources away from other essential public services, such as healthcare and infrastructure. Additionally, making education free could lead to a surge in demand, which could result in a decrease in the quality of education, as universities may struggle to cope with the increased student intake.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I agree that a university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars. However, this should be implemented in a phased and sustainable manner, with governments exploring innovative funding models, such as income-contingent loans and public-private partnerships. Ultimately, the benefits of providing free education, including a more educated and skilled population, outweigh the costs, and it is a worthwhile investment in the future of our society.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;The role of a university professor is multifaceted, encompassing both research and education. While some people believe that professors should prioritize research, I firmly believe that they should allocate more time to educating students.First and foremost, the primary purpose of a university is to provide students with a quality education. Professors are not only expected to impart knowledge but also to mentor, guide, and inspire their students. By dedicating more time to teaching, professors can create a more engaging and effective learning environment. This, in turn, can lead to better academic outcomes, increased student satisfaction, and a more positive university experience.Moreover, students who are taught by professors who are passionate about education tend to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter and are more likely to pursue further studies or careers in their chosen field. Furthermore, professors who prioritize teaching are more likely to be approachable, available, and willing to provide individualized support, which is essential for students who may be struggling with course material.While research is undoubtedly important, it is not mutually exclusive with teaching. In fact, many professors find that their research informs and enhances their teaching, and vice versa. By allocating more time to education, professors can actually improve the quality of their research by staying up-to-date with the latest developments in their field and by being able to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems.In conclusion, while research is an essential component of a professor's role, I firmly believe that they should prioritize education. By doing so, they can create a more positive and effective learning environment, foster a deeper understanding of the subject matter, and ultimately, produce better-equipped and more motivated graduates.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;"The influence of television and movies on people's behavior has been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars for many years. While some argue that the media has a significant impact on shaping people's attitudes and behaviors, others claim that its influence is minimal. In this essay, I will argue that television and movies do indeed influence people's behavior, and I will provide several reasons and examples to support this claim.Firstly, television and movies have the power to shape people's perceptions and attitudes towards certain issues. For example, films like ""Schindler's List"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" have raised awareness about the atrocities of the Holocaust and slavery, and have sparked conversations about racism and social justice. Similarly, TV shows like ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and ""Black-ish"" have brought attention to issues like reproductive rights and police brutality, encouraging viewers to think critically about these topics.Secondly, television and movies can influence people's behavior by portraying certain behaviors as desirable or undesirable. For example, smoking was once glamorized in movies and TV shows, but in recent years, it has been depicted as a negative habit. As a result, smoking rates have declined significantly among young people. On the other hand, movies and TV shows that portray violence and aggression as acceptable can desensitize viewers to these behaviors and even encourage them to emulate them.Finally, television and movies can also influence people's behavior by providing role models and inspiration. For example, films like ""Hidden Figures"" and ""The Imitation Game"" have inspired young people, especially girls and minorities, to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Similarly, TV shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Scandal"" have portrayed strong, intelligent, and complex female characters, providing role models for young women.In conclusion, television and movies have a significant influence on people's behavior, shaping their perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors. While the media is not the sole determinant of people's behavior, it is an important factor that can inspire, educate, and even desensitize viewers to certain issues and behaviors."
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;Museums have become a staple in the itineraries of travelers worldwide. People from diverse backgrounds and age groups flock to these cultural institutions, eager to experience the essence of the place they are visiting. In my opinion, people visit museums for a multitude of reasons, primarily driven by a desire to understand the local history, culture, and art.One primary reason for visiting museums is to gain insight into the historical context of a place. Museums often house a vast array of artifacts, relics, and exhibits that showcase the evolution of a city or country over time. For instance, the British Museum in London offers a comprehensive understanding of the British Empire's history, with its vast collection of artifacts from ancient civilizations. By exploring these exhibits, travelers can develop a deeper appreciation for the local customs, traditions, and values that shape the identity of a place.Another reason people visit museums is to appreciate the local art and architecture. Museums frequently feature an extensive collection of artworks, sculptures, and installations created by renowned local artists. The Louvre in Paris, for example, is a must-visit destination for art enthusiasts, housing an impressive collection of French art, including the Mona Lisa. By experiencing the local art scene, travelers can gain a unique perspective on the aesthetic values and creative expressions of a culture.Lastly, museums offer a unique opportunity for travelers to engage with the local community and like-minded individuals. Many museums host guided tours, workshops, and interactive exhibits that foster a sense of community and cultural exchange. The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C., for instance, offers a range of interactive exhibits and programs that encourage visitors to learn from each other and share their experiences.In conclusion, people visit museums for a variety of reasons, including a desire to understand the local history, culture, and art. By exploring these institutions, travelers can develop a deeper appreciation for the place they are visiting, engage with the local community, and create lasting memories of their trip.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"In today's fast-paced and densely populated world, the notion that we should not expect people to be polite to others has sparked a contentious debate. While some may argue that politeness is a luxury we can no longer afford in our frenetic lives, I firmly disagree with this statement. Politeness is not only a virtue that fosters a sense of community and respect, but it is also a vital component of a well-functioning society.In a busy and crowded world, politeness can be a beacon of hope and kindness. A simple ""please"" or ""thank you"" can go a long way in brightening someone's day, while a courteous gesture can diffuse tension and prevent conflict. Moreover, politeness promotes a sense of empathy and understanding, encouraging us to consider the feelings and perspectives of those around us. By being polite, we acknowledge the inherent value and dignity of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances.Furthermore, the erosion of politeness can have severe consequences. When we abandon politeness, we risk creating a society that is characterized by indifference, intolerance, and aggression. We see this already in the rising incidence of road rage, online harassment, and public altercations. In contrast, a polite society is one that values respect, cooperation, and constructive communication.While it is true that our busy lives can make it challenging to be polite at all times, I firmly believe that this is no excuse for abandoning politeness altogether. Rather, we should strive to cultivate a culture of politeness, one that is grounded in empathy, kindness, and respect. By doing so, we can create a more harmonious and compassionate world, even in the midst of chaos and congestion. Ultimately, politeness is not a luxury, but a necessity in today's busy and crowded world."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;"The age-old adage that ""when life gives you lemons, make lemonade"" couldn't be more apt in describing the transformative power of difficult experiences. I firmly agree with the statement that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. In fact, it's often the challenges we face that ultimately shape us into stronger, wiser, and more resilient individuals.One need look no further than the realm of education to see this principle in action. A student who struggles to understand a complex mathematical concept, for instance, may feel frustrated and defeated at first. However, with persistence and dedication, they come to grasp the material, and in doing so, develop a deeper appreciation for the subject and a stronger work ethic. This newfound understanding and confidence can then be applied to future challenges, allowing the student to tackle even more daunting tasks with ease.On a personal level, I can recall a time when I faced a difficult experience that ultimately became a valuable lesson. During my freshman year of college, I struggled to balance academics and extracurricular activities, leading to a disappointing first semester. Initially, I felt overwhelmed and uncertain about my abilities. However, I used this experience as an opportunity to reassess my priorities, develop better time management skills, and seek guidance from mentors. As a result, I was able to turn my academic performance around and become a more effective and efficient student.In conclusion, difficult experiences are an inevitable part of life, but it's how we respond to them that truly matters. By embracing challenges and learning from our mistakes, we can transform what seem like insurmountable obstacles into valuable lessons that shape us into stronger, more capable, and more compassionate individuals."
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;The age-old debate about whether life in a city is better than life in the countryside has been a topic of discussion for many years. While some people may argue that the peace and tranquility of the countryside make it a more desirable place to live, I firmly believe that life in a city is far superior.First and foremost, cities offer a wide range of job opportunities that are simply not available in rural areas. With many businesses and industries concentrated in urban centers, cities provide a diverse range of career paths and opportunities for advancement. In contrast, job options in the countryside are often limited, and wages can be lower. Furthermore, cities are hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship, with many startups and small businesses emerging in urban areas. This creates a dynamic and exciting work environment that is hard to find in rural areas.Another advantage of city life is the access to amenities and services that it provides. Cities have a wide range of restaurants, shops, and entertainment options, such as theaters, museums, and music venues. In contrast, rural areas often have limited options for dining, shopping, and entertainment. Additionally, cities have well-developed public transportation systems, making it easy to get around without a car. This is particularly important for those who cannot afford or do not want to own a car.In conclusion, while some people may prefer the peace and quiet of the countryside, I believe that the advantages of city life far outweigh those of rural life. With its diverse range of job opportunities, access to amenities and services, and well-developed public transportation systems, city life offers a unique and exciting experience that is hard to find in rural areas. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, it is clear that cities are the place to be for those looking for a dynamic and fulfilling life.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;When considering the factors that contribute to an individual's happiness, the debate surrounding the impact of one's job versus their living environment is a longstanding one. While some argue that their living environment plays a more significant role in determining their happiness, I firmly believe that one's job has a more profound effect on their overall well-being.First and foremost, a person's job is a significant part of their daily life, occupying a substantial amount of their time and energy. The work environment, relationships with colleagues, and sense of fulfillment derived from their job can greatly influence their mood and overall satisfaction. A job that provides a sense of purpose, challenges, and opportunities for growth can lead to increased happiness, whereas a mundane or stressful job can have the opposite effect.In contrast, while one's living environment can certainly impact their happiness, its influence is often more subtle and indirect. A comfortable and safe living space can provide a sense of security and relaxation, but it is not a guarantee of happiness. Furthermore, people can adapt to their living environment over time, becoming accustomed to its flaws and limitations. On the other hand, a job that is unfulfilling or stressful can be a constant source of frustration and discontent.Moreover, research has shown that people tend to derive more happiness from experiences and achievements rather than material possessions or their physical environment. A job that provides opportunities for skill development, recognition, and a sense of accomplishment can lead to increased happiness and job satisfaction.In conclusion, while both one's job and living environment can impact their happiness, I firmly believe that their job has a more significant effect. A fulfilling and challenging job can lead to increased happiness and job satisfaction, whereas a comfortable living environment, while important, is not a guarantee of happiness.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;The way we communicate with each other has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. With the advent of technology, people have multiple options to choose from when it comes to communicating with others. While some people prefer to communicate through e-mail and voice mail, others prefer more traditional methods such as telephone or face-to-face conversation. As for me, I firmly believe that face-to-face communication is the most effective and preferred method of communication.Face-to-face communication allows for a more personal and intimate connection with the other person. When we communicate in person, we can pick up on nonverbal cues such as body language and facial expressions, which can convey just as much information as the words we speak. This helps to prevent miscommunication and ensures that our message is conveyed clearly and effectively. Moreover, face-to-face communication allows for immediate feedback and response, which is essential in building trust and understanding.On the other hand, e-mail and voice mail can be impersonal and lack the emotional depth that face-to-face communication provides. While they are convenient and can save time, they often lack the nuance and subtlety that is present in in-person communication. Telephone communication is better than e-mail and voice mail, but it still lacks the visual cues that are present in face-to-face communication.In conclusion, while technology has provided us with various options to communicate with each other, face-to-face communication remains the most effective and preferred method of communication. It allows for a more personal connection, prevents miscommunication, and builds trust and understanding. In a world where technology is increasingly dominant, it is essential that we do not forget the importance of face-to-face communication.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";The advent of television has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we spend our leisure time. However, the notion that television has destroyed communication among friends and family is a contentious issue. In this essay, I will argue that while television may have some negative effects on communication, it is not entirely responsible for its destruction.On the one hand, excessive television watching can lead to a decline in face-to-face interactions among family members and friends. When people spend most of their free time glued to the screen, they tend to neglect quality time with their loved ones. For instance, a study revealed that families who watched television during meals were less likely to engage in meaningful conversations. Moreover, the rise of reality TV shows and soap operas has led to a culture of escapism, where people prefer to immerse themselves in virtual worlds rather than engaging with real-life relationships.On the other hand, television can also be a tool for bonding and socialization. For example, watching sports or favorite TV shows together can create common interests and topics for discussion. Moreover, many TV programs, such as documentaries and news, can spark meaningful conversations and debates among family and friends. In addition, television can also provide a platform for shared experiences, such as watching live events or award shows, which can bring people together.In conclusion, while television may have some negative effects on communication, it is not the sole culprit behind its destruction. Rather, it is a matter of balance and moderation. When used responsibly, television can be a valuable addition to our social lives, providing common interests and topics for discussion. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to ensure that television does not replace human interaction, but rather complements it.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, offering a multitude of options to suit individual preferences. While some people prefer the asynchronous nature of email or voicemail, others favor the immediacy of telephone or face-to-face communication. Personally, I prefer face-to-face communication, and for good reason.Face-to-face communication allows for a depth of interaction that is unparalleled by other methods. Nonverbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice convey emotions and intentions more effectively than words alone. This enables more nuanced and empathetic exchanges, fostering stronger relationships and more effective collaboration. Moreover, face-to-face interactions facilitate instant feedback and clarification, streamlining communication and avoiding misunderstandings.In contrast, email and voicemail can lead to misinterpretations and delayed responses, potentially causing confusion and frustration. Telephone conversations, while more immediate, still lack the visual cues that face-to-face interactions provide. Furthermore, face-to-face communication promotes a sense of accountability and professionalism, making it particularly well-suited for important discussions or meetings.That being said, there are certainly situations where other forms of communication are more practical or convenient. For instance, email is ideal for conveying information to a large group or for documenting discussions. However, for meaningful and effective communication, face-to-face interaction remains my preferred choice. In today's increasingly digital world, it is essential to strike a balance between technology-driven communication and the human connection that face-to-face interaction provides.In conclusion, while different communication methods have their advantages, face-to-face interaction offers a unique combination of emotional depth, immediacy, and professionalism, making it my preferred choice.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;"The statement ""haste makes waste"" is a timeless adage that warns against the perils of rushing into things without due consideration. This phrase is particularly relevant in today's fast-paced world, where the pressure to act quickly and achieve instant results can be overwhelming. In my opinion, I wholeheartedly agree with the statement, and I would like to present several reasons and examples to support this viewpoint.Firstly, haste often leads to careless mistakes and oversights. When we rush into decisions or actions, we tend to overlook important details and neglect to consider potential consequences. A classic example of this is the story of the Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage due to excessive speed in treacherous waters. If the crew had taken more time to assess the situation and respond cautiously, the tragic outcome might have been avoided.Secondly, haste can result in subpar performance and decreased productivity. When we rush through tasks, we often sacrifice quality and attention to detail, which can ultimately lead to wasted time and resources. For instance, a study on software development found that teams that prioritized speed over quality ended up producing more bugs and requiring more rework, ultimately delaying the project's completion.Lastly, haste can also lead to physical and mental harm. Rushing through daily tasks can lead to accidents, injuries, and exhaustion, while hasty decisions can lead to anxiety, stress, and regret. A striking example of this is the phenomenon of ""burnout,"" where individuals push themselves too hard and too fast, only to end up exhausted, demotivated, and unproductive.In conclusion, the phrase ""haste makes waste"" is a wise saying that cautions us against the dangers of rushing through life. By taking the time to reflect, consider, and plan, we can avoid mistakes, achieve better outcomes, and maintain our physical and mental well-being."
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;The invention of the automobile has undoubtedly had a profound impact on modern life, and opinions about its effects vary widely. In my opinion, the automobile has caused more serious problems than improvements.On the one hand, the automobile has certainly brought about many benefits. It has increased mobility and independence, allowing people to travel long distances quickly and easily. This has opened up new opportunities for work, leisure, and socializing. For instance, many people rely on their cars to commute to work or to go on holiday.However, I firmly believe that the negative consequences of the automobile outweigh its advantages. One of the most significant problems caused by the automobile is air pollution. The emissions from cars have been linked to serious health problems, such as respiratory diseases and cancer. Moreover, the automobile has contributed to climate change, which is one of the most pressing issues of our time. The production and disposal of cars also have a devastating impact on the environment, with large amounts of waste and pollution generated.Another serious problem caused by the automobile is urban sprawl. As cities have expanded and cars have become the dominant mode of transportation, urban areas have become increasingly spread out, leading to a lack of green spaces and a decline in public transportation. This has resulted in a decrease in the quality of life for many people, as they spend more time stuck in traffic and less time enjoying public spaces.Furthermore, the automobile has also had a negative impact on social relationships and community cohesion. As people spend more time in their cars and less time interacting with others, communities have become increasingly fragmented and isolated.In conclusion, while the automobile has brought about some benefits, I firmly believe that its negative consequences, such as air pollution, urban sprawl, and social isolation, outweigh its advantages.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;The question of whether children should choose jobs similar to their parents' or opt for something different has been a topic of debate for many years. While some argue that following in their parents' footsteps can provide stability and familiarity, I firmly disagree with the statement. Choosing a job that is very different from one's parents' can be beneficial for children in numerous ways.Firstly, pursuing a career vastly different from their parents' allows children to develop their own identity and interests. By exploring various fields, they can discover their true passions and strengths, which may not be aligned with their parents' profession. This independence enables them to make informed decisions about their career paths and create their own sense of purpose.Moreover, choosing a different career path exposes children to new experiences, skills, and networks. This broadens their perspective, fosters creativity, and equips them with the ability to adapt to diverse environments. In contrast, following in their parents’ footsteps may limit their exposure to new ideas and opportunities, potentially stifling their personal and professional growth.Additionally, the job market is constantly evolving, and many traditional occupations are becoming obsolete. By encouraging children to explore different career options, we can prepare them for the demands of the modern workforce. This forward-thinking approach enables them to stay ahead of the curve and capitalize on emerging opportunities.In conclusion, while there may be some benefits to choosing a job similar to one's parents', I firmly believe that opting for a career that is very different can be more beneficial for children. By embracing their individuality, exploring new opportunities, and preparing themselves for the future job market, children can set themselves up for success and create a fulfilling career path that truly reflects their aspirations.
248;Do you agree or disagree: To make children do well at school, parents should limit the time that children spend on watching TV and movies.;In 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.First of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.Moreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?Admittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.;The amount of time children spend watching TV and movies has long been a topic of debate among parents and educators. While some argue that these activities have educational value, I firmly believe that to help children succeed academically, parents should indeed limit the time spent on watching TV and movies.First and foremost, excessive screen time has been proven to be detrimental to a child's academic performance. Studies have shown that children who spend more time watching TV and movies tend to have lower grades and decreased attention span. This is because these activities can be passively entertaining, requiring little mental effort or engagement. In contrast, academic success requires active engagement, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, all of which are compromised when children spend too much time in front of the screen.Furthermore, limiting TV and movie time can free up time for more productive and enriching activities. Children who spend less time watching screens are more likely to engage in outdoor play, reading, and other hobbies that promote physical and mental well-being. These activities not only promote healthy habits but also foster creativity, imagination, and social skills, all of which are essential for academic success.Another important consideration is the content of TV shows and movies. While some programs may be educational, many others are filled with violence, consumerism, and unhealthy values. By limiting screen time, parents can also limit their child's exposure to these negative influences and promote a more balanced and wholesome worldview.In conclusion, while TV and movies can be enjoyable and entertaining, excessive screen time can be detrimental to a child's academic success. By setting limits on screen time, parents can promote healthier habits, foster creativity and imagination, and provide their children with the best possible chance of succeeding in school.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;The debate about whether professional athletes deserve their high salaries has been a longstanding one. On one hand, some argue that athletes are entertainers who bring immense joy and excitement to millions of fans around the world. They put their bodies on the line every time they step onto the field, court, or rink, risking serious injury and potentially shortening their careers. In return, they deserve to be compensated handsomely for their skills, dedication, and sacrifices.On the other hand, others argue that athletes' salaries are grossly inflated and unfair. They point out that teachers, nurses, and other essential workers, who contribute significantly to society, earn a fraction of what athletes do. Additionally, the astronomical sums of money paid to athletes can create unrealistic expectations and promote a culture of excess and entitlement.However, it's essential to consider the economics of professional sports. Athletes are the driving force behind the massive revenue generated by sports leagues, teams, and sponsors. They attract huge audiences, which in turn, attract lucrative advertising deals and sponsorship agreements. According to a recent report, the global sports industry is projected to reach $500 billion by 2025. It's only fair that athletes receive a significant share of the revenue they help generate.Moreover, top athletes are often one-in-a-million talents, honed through years of intense training and hard work. Their unique skills and abilities set them apart from others, and their compensation should reflect their exceptional value to their teams and the sport as a whole. In conclusion, while it's understandable to question the high salaries of professional athletes, it's also important to acknowledge the significant value they bring to their teams, leagues, and the sports industry as a whole. Rather than focusing solely on their salaries, we should strive to create a more equitable system that rewards athletes fairly for their contributions, while also ensuring that other essential workers receive the compensation they deserve.
250;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who canÕt accept othersÕ criticism canÕt succeed in group working.Ê;"In everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.First, the core of group working is ""consensus"". It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.Second, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: ""The good medicine tastes bitter“. Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.However, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.In conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident.";The ability to accept others' criticism is an essential skill for individuals who aim to succeed in group working. In a team-based environment, constructive criticism is a valuable tool for growth, improvement, and innovation. When individuals are open to feedback, they demonstrate a willingness to learn, adapt, and refine their ideas. This, in turn, fosters a collaborative atmosphere, where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.On the other hand, those who cannot accept criticism often struggle to work effectively in groups. Their defensiveness and resistance to feedback can lead to conflicts, hinder progress, and create an unproductive work environment. When individuals become overly attached to their ideas and are unable to consider alternative perspectives, they miss out on opportunities for growth and improvement. Moreover, their inflexibility can lead to a lack of trust and respect from their team members, ultimately undermining the team's overall performance.In addition, the inability to accept criticism can also limit personal growth and development. When individuals are not open to feedback, they miss out on chances to identify and address their weaknesses, and as a result, they may plateau in their skills and knowledge. In a rapidly changing work environment, the ability to adapt and evolve is crucial for success.In conclusion, I strongly agree with the statement that people who cannot accept others' criticism cannot succeed in group working. The ability to receive and act on feedback is essential for effective collaboration, personal growth, and ultimately, success in a team-based environment. By embracing criticism and using it as a tool for improvement, individuals can position themselves for success and make valuable contributions to their team.
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;"The question of whether young children should be required to learn music and art in addition to the core subjects of math, science, history, and language is a contentious issue. While some argue that music and art are essential components of a well-rounded education, others believe that they take away from the focus on more ""practical"" subjects.In my opinion, music and art are crucial elements of a child's educational development. Not only do they foster creativity and self-expression, but they also provide numerous cognitive benefits. Research has shown that music education can improve spatial-temporal skills, which are essential for problem-solving and critical thinking. Similarly, art education has been linked to improved fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and visual processing abilities.Moreover, music and art provide children with a unique outlet for emotional expression and stress relief. In a world where academic pressures and expectations are increasingly high, it is essential that children have a safe and constructive way to express themselves and manage their emotions. Music and art classes provide a much-needed break from the rigors of traditional academic subjects, allowing children to recharge and refocus.Furthermore, music and art education can have long-term benefits for children's future careers and personal development. Many successful individuals, from entrepreneurs to scientists, have credited music and art education with helping them develop valuable skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration.In conclusion, requiring young children to learn music and art in addition to the core subjects is essential for their cognitive, emotional, and social development. Rather than viewing music and art as ""extracurricular"" activities, we should integrate them into the mainstream curriculum, providing children with a well-rounded education that prepares them for success in all areas of life."
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;"The age-old question of how to spark students' interest in a particular subject has long been a topic of debate among educators. While some may argue that making the material more engaging or interactive is the key, I firmly believe that explaining how the subject will help students in their lives outside of school is the most effective approach.When students are able to see the practical relevance of a subject, they are more likely to become invested in learning about it. By showing them how the skills and knowledge they acquire in the classroom can be applied to real-world situations, teachers can help students understand the value and importance of the subject matter. This, in turn, can lead to a greater sense of purpose and motivation to learn.Furthermore, explaining the practical applications of a subject can also help to dispel the notion that school is somehow separate from the ""real world."" By highlighting the connections between academic subjects and everyday life, teachers can help students see that the skills they are learning are not just abstract concepts, but rather essential tools that will serve them well in their future careers and personal lives.Of course, some may argue that this approach oversimplifies the value of education, reducing it to mere utility. However, I would counter that by showing students the practical relevance of a subject, teachers are not diminishing its value, but rather illuminating its significance. Ultimately, I firmly believe that explaining how a subject will help students in their lives outside of school is a powerful way to inspire interest and motivation in the classroom."
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, pollution, and environmental degradation, governments are faced with a crucial decision: where to allocate their budget. While economic development is undoubtedly important, this essay argues that governments should prioritize environmental protection over economic development.On one hand, economic development is often seen as the primary driver of growth and prosperity. Governments invest in infrastructure, industry, and innovation to create jobs, stimulate economic activity, and improve living standards. However, this narrow focus on economic development comes at a significant cost to the environment. The relentless pursuit of growth and profit has led to widespread environmental degradation, including deforestation, pollution, and climate change.On the other hand, investing in environmental protection can have numerous economic benefits in the long run. For instance, preserving natural habitats and ecosystems can support biodiversity, improve air and water quality, and even create jobs in eco-tourism and conservation. Moreover, the cost of environmental degradation far outweighs the cost of prevention. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution alone costs the global economy over $5 trillion annually.Furthermore, environmental protection is a moral imperative. As the custodians of the planet, governments have a responsibility to protect the natural world for future generations. The consequences of environmental degradation are already being felt, from devastating natural disasters to food and water scarcity.In conclusion, while economic development is important, governments should prioritize environmental protection in their budget allocation. The long-term benefits of investing in the environment far outweigh the short-term gains of economic development. By prioritizing environmental protection, governments can ensure a sustainable future, support economic growth, and uphold their moral obligation to protect the planet.
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This prediction is based on several factors that are currently transforming the transportation landscape.One major reason for this shift is the increasing popularity of alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles, electric scooters, and ride-hailing services. Many cities are now investing heavily in bike lanes, pedestrianized zones, and public transportation systems, making it easier for people to get around without owning a car. For instance, cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam have already seen a significant decrease in car usage due to their extensive cycling infrastructure.Another significant factor is the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles. While these technologies are often associated with car ownership, they also enable new forms of mobility, such as car-sharing and ride-hailing services, which reduce the need for individual car ownership. Companies like Waymo and Tesla are already pioneering autonomous taxi services, which could revolutionize the way we think about car usage.Furthermore, urbanization and demographic changes are also contributing to a decline in car ownership. As people move to cities, they are more likely to rely on public transportation, walking, and cycling. Additionally, younger generations are showing less interest in car ownership, with many opting for more sustainable and affordable transportation options.Finally, governments and cities are implementing policies to reduce car usage, such as congestion charges, low-emission zones, and parking restrictions. These measures aim to discourage car usage and promote more sustainable modes of transportation.In conclusion, considering these factors, it is likely that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. As people increasingly turn to alternative modes of transportation, and as technology and policy changes shape the transportation landscape, car ownership is likely to decline.
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;The debate about whether university students should attend classes as long as they can pass their examinations has been a contentious issue. While some argue that attendance is not necessary, I strongly disagree with this statement. Attending classes is an integral part of the university experience, offering numerous benefits that go beyond mere academic success.First and foremost, attending classes provides students with the opportunity to engage in interactive learning, ask questions, and participate in discussions. This face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers fosters a deeper understanding of complex concepts, promotes critical thinking, and enhances problem-solving skills. By attending classes, students can clarify doubts, seek guidance, and gain valuable insights that may not be possible through self-study or online resources.Moreover, attending classes helps students develop essential soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and time management. By participating in group projects, presentations, and debates, students learn to collaborate, articulate their thoughts, and manage their time effectively. These skills are crucial in the professional world, where employers value not only academic knowledge but also the ability to work effectively in a team and communicate ideas clearly.Furthermore, attending classes provides students with a sense of community and accountability. Being part of a learning environment motivates students to stay on track, set goals, and strive for excellence. Regular attendance also demonstrates a student's commitment to their studies, which can be a valuable attribute in the eyes of employers and academic evaluators.In conclusion, while passing examinations is undoubtedly important, it is not the only measure of a university student's success. Attending classes offers a wide range of benefits that complement academic achievement, including interactive learning, soft skill development, and a sense of community. Therefore, I firmly believe that attending classes is an essential part of the university experience, and students should prioritize regular attendance to maximize their learning and growth.
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;"The age-old debate about the role of hard work and luck in achieving success has been a longstanding topic of discussion. The quotation ""When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success"" suggests that success is solely the result of individual effort. However, I disagree with this statement, as luck undoubtedly plays a significant role in achieving success.While hard work and dedication are essential components of success, luck can often provide the necessary opportunities and circumstances that facilitate achievement. Many successful individuals have attributed their accomplishments to a combination of hard work and luck. For instance, a person may work tirelessly to develop a skill, but it is the lucky break of meeting the right person or being in the right place at the right time that ultimately leads to their success.Moreover, the concept of privilege also highlights the significance of luck in achieving success. Some individuals are born into advantageous circumstances, such as having access to quality education, networks, and resources, which can greatly enhance their chances of success. In contrast, those who are less fortunate may face significant obstacles that hinder their ability to succeed, despite their hard work and dedication.Furthermore, the role of luck is also evident in the success stories of many entrepreneurs and innovators. Often, it is a combination of hard work and luck that leads to a groundbreaking discovery or a successful business venture. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, is a prime example of someone who attributed his success to a mix of hard work and luck.In conclusion, while hard work is undoubtedly a crucial factor in achieving success, luck also plays a significant role. The quotation above oversimplifies the complex interplay between individual effort and circumstance. A more accurate assessment would acknowledge that success is often the result of a combination of hard work, dedication, and luck."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;The debate about whether individuals learn better with or without a teacher has been ongoing for quite some time. Some people believe that self-directed learning is more effective, while others argue that having a teacher is crucial for successful learning. As for me, I firmly believe that having a teacher is the better option, and here's why.First and foremost, a teacher provides personalized guidance and support. In a traditional classroom setting, a teacher can tailor their instruction to meet the unique needs of each student, addressing their strengths and weaknesses. This individualized attention allows students to grasp complex concepts more efficiently and fill knowledge gaps. Moreover, a teacher can offer immediate feedback, helping students correct mistakes and reinforce good study habits.Another significant advantage of having a teacher is the opportunity for interactive learning. A teacher can facilitate discussions, debates, and group activities that encourage critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration. These interactive experiences not only make learning more engaging but also help students develop essential life skills, such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution.Furthermore, a teacher can provide structure and accountability, which are essential for maintaining motivation and staying on track. Without a teacher, it's easy to fall behind or lose focus, especially when faced with challenging material. A teacher, on the other hand, can establish clear goals, set deadlines, and offer encouragement, helping students stay motivated and committed to their learning objectives.In conclusion, while some people may prefer self-directed learning, I firmly believe that having a teacher is the better option. With personalized guidance, interactive learning experiences, and structured accountability, a teacher can help students achieve their full potential and make the learning process more enjoyable and effective.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;The concept of remote work has gained significant traction in recent years, and opinions are divided on whether working from home is more effective than working from a traditional office setting. In this essay, I will argue that working from home with a computer and phone can be better than working at a company's office, but only under certain circumstances.On the one hand, working from home provides employees with a quiet and comfortable environment that is conducive to productivity. Without the distractions and interruptions that often come with working in an office, employees can focus on their tasks and work more efficiently. Additionally, working from home eliminates the need for daily commutes, which can be time-consuming and stressful. This can lead to a better work-life balance, as employees have more time to spend with family and friends, or pursue hobbies and interests.On the other hand, working from home can also have its drawbacks. Without face-to-face interactions with colleagues and supervisors, employees may feel isolated and disconnected from the company. This can lead to communication breakdowns, misunderstandings, and a lack of collaboration and teamwork. Moreover, working from home requires a high degree of self-motivation and discipline, as employees need to stay focused and avoid distractions, such as social media and household chores.However, I believe that with the right mindset, equipment, and company support, working from home can be a more effective and productive way of working. Many companies are now embracing remote work options, providing employees with the tools and resources they need to stay connected and work efficiently from home. By offering flexible work arrangements, companies can attract and retain top talent, improve employee satisfaction, and increase productivity.In conclusion, while working from home with a computer and phone may not be suitable for everyone, I agree that it can be better than working at a company's office under certain circumstances. By providing the right support and resources, companies can help employees stay productive, connected, and motivated, leading to a better work-life balance and increased job satisfaction.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;I disagree with the statement that in order to succeed, one should be more like others than be different from everyone else. This notion suggests that conformity is the key to success, but I firmly believe that individuality and uniqueness are the driving forces behind true achievement.History has shown us that the most influential and successful people are those who have dared to be different. People like Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Frida Kahlo, who refused to conform to societal norms, are the ones who have made the most significant contributions to their respective fields. Their uniqueness and willingness to challenge the status quo have led to groundbreaking innovations and artistic expressions that have shaped the world.Moreover, trying to be like others can lead to mediocrity and stagnation. When we attempt to fit in, we often compromise our own values, beliefs, and talents in order to blend in with the crowd. This can result in a lack of originality and creativity, which are essential qualities for success in any field. On the other hand, embracing our differences and individuality allows us to stand out, take risks, and push boundaries, leading to innovative ideas and solutions that can change the world.Furthermore, in today's increasingly diverse and globalized world, it is our unique perspectives and experiences that can bring about positive change and progress. By celebrating and embracing our differences, we can create a more inclusive and dynamic society that values creativity, diversity, and innovation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is our differences, not our similarities, that are the keys to success. By embracing our individuality and uniqueness, we can unlock our full potential, make meaningful contributions, and leave a lasting impact on the world.
260;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Younger school children (aged five to ten) should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science and history.Ê;Undoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.First of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. In addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.Admittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.In a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.;I strongly agree with the statement that younger school children, aged five to ten, should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science, and history. Incorporating art and music into a child's curriculum can have a profound impact on their cognitive, emotional, and social development.Research has shown that studying art and music can improve a child's spatial-temporal skills, which are essential for problem-solving and critical thinking. Additionally, engaging in creative activities can enhance a child's self-esteem and confidence, allowing them to express themselves in a unique and meaningful way. Art and music also provide an outlet for children to convey emotions and ideas, promoting emotional intelligence and empathy.Moreover, studying art and music can have a positive impact on a child's academic performance. Studies have found that students who participate in art and music programs tend to perform better in math and reading. This is likely due to the fact that art and music require critical thinking, creativity, and attention to detail, all of which are valuable skills that can be applied to other subjects.Furthermore, introducing art and music at a young age can foster a lifelong appreciation and enjoyment of these subjects. Many famous artists and musicians began their creative journeys at a young age, and it is likely that early exposure to these subjects sparked their passion and talent.In conclusion, requiring younger school children to study art and music, in addition to the core subjects, is essential for their overall development. Not only can it improve their academic performance and cognitive skills, but it can also provide an outlet for creativity, self-expression, and emotional intelligence. By incorporating art and music into a child's curriculum, we can help them become well-rounded, creative, and empathetic individuals.
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;The challenges that young people face today are vastly different from those experienced by their parents and grandparents when they were young. While it is true that certain challenges, such as the struggle for independence and financial stability, are timeless and universal, many of the specific difficulties faced by young people today are unique to their generation.One major difference is the impact of technology on young people's lives. Social media, in particular, has created a new set of challenges that did not exist for previous generations. Cyberbullying, online harassment, and the pressure to present a perfect online image are just a few examples of the ways in which technology is affecting young people's mental health and wellbeing. Additionally, the rise of the gig economy and zero-hours contracts has created a new level of uncertainty and insecurity for young people in the workforce, making it harder for them to plan for the future.Furthermore, the world that young people are growing up in is vastly different from the one their parents and grandparents knew. Climate change, for example, is a pressing concern that was not on the radar of previous generations. Young people are growing up with the knowledge that they will have to deal with the consequences of climate change, and this is creating a sense of anxiety and uncertainty about their future.In conclusion, while some challenges faced by young people are timeless and universal, many are unique to their generation. The impact of technology, changes in the workforce, and global concerns such as climate change have created a new set of challenges that are different from those faced by previous generations. It is essential that we acknowledge and address these differences in order to provide the support and guidance that young people need to thrive.
262;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.First of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.Second, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won’t be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.;When it comes to academic pursuits, there is an ongoing debate about whether it is more beneficial to have broad knowledge of many subjects or to specialize in one specific area. In my opinion, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous than specializing in one specific subject.On one hand, having a broad knowledge base allows individuals to make connections between seemingly unrelated fields, fostering creativity and innovation. For instance, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, credited his knowledge of calligraphy for inspiring the development of the Macintosh computer's typography. His broad knowledge of art and design, combined with his technical expertise, enabled him to create a revolutionary product that merged aesthetics with functionality.On the other hand, specializing in one specific subject can lead to a narrow focus, limiting one's ability to think outside the box. While it is true that specializing can lead to expertise and mastery of a particular field, it can also result in a lack of understanding of the broader context and interconnectedness of ideas.Moreover, having broad knowledge of many subjects prepares individuals for an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world. In today's fast-paced, interdisciplinary work environment, employees are expected to be versatile and adaptable. By having a broad knowledge base, individuals can navigate different fields and industries, making them more valuable to employers.In conclusion, while specializing in one specific subject has its advantages, I firmly believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial. It allows individuals to think creatively, make connections between fields, and navigate an increasingly complex work environment.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;"I strongly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. This mindset is crucial for achieving greatness and making a lasting impact in various fields.One of the primary reasons successful people try new things is that it allows them to innovate and stay ahead of the curve. By taking risks and exploring uncharted territories, they open themselves up to new experiences, knowledge, and skills that can lead to groundbreaking discoveries. For instance, Steve Jobs co-founded Apple and revolutionized the tech industry by introducing the Macintosh computer, which was a risk that paid off and transformed the way people interact with technology. Similarly, J.K. Rowling took a risk by publishing her book ""Harry Potter"" despite facing numerous rejections, and it went on to become a global phenomenon.Another reason successful people try new things is that it fosters personal growth and development. By stepping out of their comfort zones, they challenge themselves to adapt, learn, and evolve. Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, is a prime example of this. He has ventured into various industries, from music to space travel, and has learned from his successes and failures. This willingness to take risks has enabled him to build a business empire and become one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our time.Moreover, trying new things and taking risks also builds resilience and helps individuals develop a growth mindset. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" This attitude towards failure is what sets successful people apart, as they view failures as opportunities to learn and improve.In conclusion, successful people indeed try new things and take risks, rather than sticking to what they already know how to do well. This approach allows them to innovate, grow, and build resilience, ultimately leading to remarkable achievements and a lasting impact."
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;While it is true that studying hard in school is crucial for future success, I strongly agree with the statement that the ability to relate well to people is more important. In today's increasingly interconnected and collaborative work environment, possessing strong interpersonal skills can make all the difference in one's career.First and foremost, being able to relate well to people enables individuals to build and maintain a strong professional network. This network can lead to valuable job opportunities, mentorship, and access to valuable advice and resources. For instance, a study by LinkedIn found that 85% of jobs are filled through networking. In contrast, solely relying on academic achievement may not provide the same level of access to job opportunities.Moreover, the ability to relate well to people is essential for effective teamwork and communication in the workplace. Employers often prioritize candidates who can work collaboratively with others, think creatively, and resolve conflicts in a professional manner. A survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that 70% of employers consider teamwork and communication skills to be essential for job success.On the other hand, while studying hard in school is important for developing a strong foundation of knowledge, it is not a guarantee of success in the workplace. Many individuals with excellent academic credentials struggle to find employment or advance in their careers due to their inability to relate well to others.In conclusion, while studying hard in school is important, the ability to relate well to people is more crucial for success in a future job. By building a strong professional network, working effectively in teams, and communicating well with others, individuals can set themselves up for long-term success and advancement in their careers.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;The statement that advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits is a contentious issue. While some argue that advertising plays a significant role in promoting unhealthy eating habits, others believe that it is not the primary cause. In this essay, I will argue that advertising is indeed a major contributor to unhealthy eating habits, but it is not the sole cause.On the one hand, advertising can have a profound impact on our eating habits. The constant bombardment of advertisements for processed and fast foods can be overwhelming, making it difficult for individuals, especially children, to make healthy choices. Research has shown that children who are exposed to food advertising are more likely to request and consume unhealthy foods. Moreover, advertising often manipulates consumers by creating a false narrative around certain products, making them appear healthier or more appealing than they actually are.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that advertising is just one of the many factors that contribute to unhealthy eating habits. Other factors, such as socio-economic status, education, and access to healthy food options, also play a significant role. Additionally, personal preferences, cultural background, and lifestyle choices cannot be ignored.In conclusion, while advertising is not the sole cause of unhealthy eating habits, it is undoubtedly a significant contributor. It is crucial for governments, healthcare professionals, and individuals to acknowledge the impact of advertising on our eating habits and take steps to mitigate its negative effects. This can be achieved through regulations on food advertising, education on healthy eating, and promoting healthy food options. By acknowledging the role of advertising and addressing the broader factors that contribute to unhealthy eating habits, we can work towards creating a healthier food culture.
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";While some may argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family, I firmly believe that this is an exaggeration. In reality, television has both positive and negative effects on communication, and its impact largely depends on how it is used.On the one hand, excessive television viewing can indeed lead to a decline in face-to-face communication among family members and friends. When people spend too much time watching TV, they tend to have fewer conversations with each other. This can lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection, even among those living in the same household. For example, a family that spends their evenings watching TV together may not engage in meaningful conversations or share their daily experiences with each other.On the other hand, television can also serve as a tool that brings people together and facilitates communication. Many TV shows and programs are designed to spark interesting conversations and debates. For instance, a family that watches a thought-provoking documentary together may engage in discussions about the topic, sharing their thoughts and opinions. Similarly, TV can provide a common interest for friends to bond over, such as watching a favorite sports team or TV show together.Furthermore, with the rise of social media and online platforms, television is no longer a solo activity. Many people now watch TV while interacting with others on social media, sharing their reactions and opinions in real-time. This has created new opportunities for communication and social interaction, even if it is not face-to-face.In conclusion, while excessive television viewing can have negative effects on communication, it is not the primary cause of destruction of communication among friends and family. Television can be a tool that brings people together, sparks interesting conversations, and provides a common interest for social bonding. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to use television in a way that promotes communication and social interaction.
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;The statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries at universities and colleges is a topic of ongoing debate. While some people may disagree, I strongly agree with this assertion.First and foremost, sports and social activities play a crucial role in fostering a well-rounded education. They provide students with opportunities to develop essential life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication. By participating in sports and social activities, students can also improve their physical and mental health, which is essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.Moreover, sports and social activities are instrumental in promoting campus life and creating a sense of community among students. They provide a platform for students to interact with each other, build relationships, and make lifelong friendships. This, in turn, enhances the overall university experience and contributes to student satisfaction and retention.Furthermore, investing in sports and social activities can have long-term benefits for universities and colleges. It can enhance their reputation, attract prospective students, and increase alumni engagement. A strong sports and social program can also provide a competitive edge in the higher education market, setting an institution apart from its peers.In conclusion, sports and social activities are indeed just as important as classes and libraries at universities and colleges. They provide students with essential life skills, promote campus life, and contribute to the overall university experience. Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that they should receive equal financial support. By investing in sports and social activities, universities and colleges can provide students with a more holistic education and set them up for success in all aspects of life.
268;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. ;To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned, good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons. However, if one coniders the issue carefully, he or she may agree the title statement as I do.First of all, friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career. Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job. Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields, imagine when you are in trouble, you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you, so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible, even an esy phone call, instend of a series of complex solutions.Futuermore, no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company, relating well to people is also a importent issue. If top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them. Consequently, make a good relationship with them.On the other side, if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss, only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position.However, someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job. Studying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job. But imagine it, a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people, and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former, which person do you want to be? I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future.In my point of view, I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school.;The statement that the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school for success in a future job is a widely debated topic. While some argue that academic achievements are the key to success, others claim that interpersonal skills play a more significant role. In this essay, I will argue that I agree with the statement, and the ability to relate well to people is indeed more important than studying hard in school.In today's fast-paced and competitive job market, employers are no longer solely looking for candidates with excellent grades or academic achievements. They are searching for individuals who can effectively communicate, collaborate, and build strong relationships with colleagues, clients, and customers. The ability to relate well to people is essential in creating a positive work environment, resolving conflicts, and driving team success. Good interpersonal skills can also lead to better networking opportunities, career advancement, and professional growth.On the other hand, studying hard in school is undoubtedly important, but it is not the only factor that determines success in a future job. Many successful individuals have achieved their goals without being top students. Furthermore, the skills and knowledge acquired in school can become outdated, but the ability to relate well to people remains a timeless and transferable skill.Moreover, the increasing use of automation and artificial intelligence in the workforce highlights the importance of human skills, such as empathy, creativity, and problem-solving, which are difficult to replicate by machines. In this context, the ability to relate well to people becomes even more valuable, as it allows individuals to work effectively with others, build trust, and drive innovation.In conclusion, while studying hard in school is important, I firmly believe that the ability to relate well to people is more important for success in a future job. As the job market continues to evolve, employers will place greater emphasis on interpersonal skills, making them a crucial factor in determining career success.
269;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? As modern life becomes more complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize;With the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.First of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.Equally important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.Finally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs. At this circumstances, they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where. It is obviously a huge waste of time. But if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination.In this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with.;As modern life continues to evolve and become increasingly complex, it is imperative for young people to develop the skills of planning and organization. In today's fast-paced world, individuals are constantly bombarded with a multitude of tasks, responsibilities, and distractions. To navigate this chaotic landscape, young people must be equipped with the ability to prioritize, schedule, and manage their time effectively.Planning and organization are essential life skills that enable individuals to achieve their goals, meet deadlines, and reduce stress. By learning how to plan and organize, young people can optimize their daily routines, allocate time for academic, extracurricular, and personal activities, and make the most of their available time. This, in turn, enhances their productivity, efficiency, and overall well-being.Moreover, in a rapidly changing world, adaptability and flexibility are crucial. Young people who can plan and organize are better equipped to respond to unexpected challenges and opportunities, adjust to new situations, and think critically. These skills are also highly valued by employers, making them a valuable asset in the job market.On the other hand, some might argue that modern technology, such as planners and apps, can automate planning and organization, making these skills less essential. However, while technology can certainly facilitate planning and organization, it is no substitute for the cognitive skills and habits of mind that underlie effective planning and organization.In conclusion, as modern life becomes increasingly complex, it is indeed essential for young people to develop the ability to plan and organize. By acquiring these skills, young people can take control of their lives, achieve their goals, and thrive in an ever-changing world.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;The debate on whether university students should be required to attend classes or not has been a longstanding issue. While some argue that attending classes should be mandatory, others believe it should be optional. In my opinion, I agree that university students should not be required to attend classes.First and foremost, university students are adults who have the capacity to make their own decisions and take responsibility for their actions. Requiring them to attend classes undermines their autonomy and treats them like high school students. Moreover, with the advancement of technology, many universities are now offering online courses and lectures, making it possible for students to learn from the comfort of their own homes. This flexibility allows students to create their own schedules and learn at their own pace.Additionally, some students may have valid reasons for missing classes, such as part-time jobs, family commitments, or personal issues. Forcing them to attend classes would only add to their stress and burden. Furthermore, students who are not interested in a particular subject or lecture may find it unnecessary to attend classes, which would be a waste of their time. By making attendance optional, students can focus on the subjects they are truly interested in and make the most of their university experience.However, it is also important to note that students who do not attend classes regularly may fall behind in their studies. To address this issue, universities can implement alternative measures such as online quizzes, assignments, and regular progress checks to ensure students are keeping up with the coursework. In conclusion, I believe that university students should not be required to attend classes. It is essential to respect their autonomy, provide flexibility, and implement alternative measures to ensure academic success.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;I agree with the statement that telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. In the past, communication was primarily face-to-face, allowing for a deeper and more intimate connection between individuals. However, with the advent of technology, the way we communicate has undergone a significant shift.One of the primary reasons for this is that electronic communication lacks nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone of voice, which are essential components of personal communication. When we rely solely on telephones and email, we risk misinterpreting or misunderstanding the intentions and emotions of the sender. For instance, a joke or a sarcastic remark may be misinterpreted as serious or even hurtful when conveyed through email or text message.Furthermore, the ease and speed of electronic communication have led to a decline in meaningful and thoughtful communication. Emails and text messages often prioritize brevity and convenience over substance and depth, resulting in a lack of emotional connection and personal touch. People are more likely to fire off a quick email or text without considering the recipient's feelings or perspective, leading to a sense of detachment and impersonality.Additionally, the rise of social media has further contributed to the depersonalization of communication. While social media platforms have made it easier to connect with people worldwide, they often reduce relationships to shallow interactions and superficial exchanges. Online communication can lack the intimacy and warmth of in-person interactions, leaving individuals feeling disconnected and isolated.In conclusion, while telephones and email have undoubtedly increased the speed and efficiency of communication, they have also contributed to a decline in personal and meaningful interactions. By prioritizing face-to-face communication and making an effort to engage in thoughtful and empathetic interactions, we can work to reclaim the personal touch that is essential to building strong, lasting relationships.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;When it comes to choosing the ideal place to live, people often find themselves torn between the charm of a small town and the vibrancy of a big city. As for me, I would prefer to live in a big city, and I'd like to explain why.First and foremost, big cities offer unparalleled opportunities for career advancement and personal growth. With a vast array of industries and companies, one can easily find a job that matches their skills and interests. For instance, cities like New York and London are hubs for finance, media, and art, providing endless opportunities for young professionals to launch their careers. In contrast, small towns often have limited job options, which can hinder one's ability to pursue their passions.Another advantage of big cities is their cultural diversity. Cities like Paris and Tokyo are melting pots of different cultures, cuisines, and lifestyles, offering a unique and enriching experience for their residents. One can easily find authentic ethnic restaurants, attend cultural festivals, and engage with people from diverse backgrounds. In small towns, however, cultural experiences are often limited, and one may have to travel far to experience the world beyond their local community.Furthermore, big cities are often better equipped with modern amenities and infrastructure. They typically have well-developed public transportation systems, world-class hospitals, and a wide range of entertainment options, such as theaters, museums, and concert halls. For example, cities like Singapore and Dubai boast state-of-the-art public transportation systems, making it easy for residents to get around without relying on personal vehicles.Of course, some may argue that small towns offer a more peaceful and close-knit community, which is true. However, I believe that the benefits of living in a big city far outweigh those of a small town. With their vast opportunities, cultural diversity, and modern amenities, big cities provide an exciting and enriching environment for individuals to thrive.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;As humans, we are wired to respond differently to new experiences and challenges. While some people prefer to stick to what they already do well, others enjoy trying new things and taking risks. Personally, I am inclined towards the latter group. I believe that trying new things and taking risks is essential for personal growth, learning, and self-improvement.Firstly, trying new things exposes us to different experiences and perspectives, broadening our understanding of the world. For instance, traveling to a new country can teach us about different cultures, traditions, and ways of life. I recall a trip I took to Japan, where I tried local cuisine, attended a traditional tea ceremony, and learned about the history of the country. This experience not only enriched my knowledge but also helped me appreciate the diversity of human experiences.Secondly, taking risks allows us to develop resilience and perseverance. When we try something new, we may face failures and setbacks. However, it is through these experiences that we learn to adapt, overcome obstacles, and develop coping strategies. For example, when I first started learning a new language, I faced numerous challenges, including pronunciation difficulties and grammatical errors. However, with persistence and practice, I was able to overcome these hurdles and become proficient in the language.Lastly, trying new things and taking risks can lead to discoveries and innovations. History is replete with examples of individuals who took risks and tried new things, leading to groundbreaking discoveries and inventions. For instance, Thomas Edison's experiments with electricity led to the invention of the light bulb, revolutionizing the world.In conclusion, while doing what we already do well can provide a sense of comfort and security, trying new things and taking risks offers numerous benefits, including personal growth, learning, and self-improvement. By embracing new experiences and challenges, we can broaden our horizons, develop resilience, and contribute to the world in meaningful ways.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;I strongly agree with the statement that children should learn to manage their own money at a young age in order to become financially responsible adults. Teaching children the value of money and how to manage it effectively is essential for their future financial stability and independence.Learning to manage money at a young age helps children develop good financial habits that will benefit them throughout their lives. By receiving a weekly or monthly allowance, children can practice budgeting, saving, and making smart spending decisions. This hands-on experience allows them to understand the consequences of their financial choices and make informed decisions about how to allocate their resources.Moreover, managing their own money at a young age helps children develop important life skills such as responsibility, self-reliance, and decision-making. When children are given the freedom to make financial decisions, they learn to prioritize their needs and wants, distinguish between essential and discretionary spending, and make sacrifices when necessary. These skills are crucial for achieving financial stability and success in adulthood.Furthermore, teaching children to manage their own money at a young age can also help them avoid debt and financial pitfalls that can have long-term consequences. By learning to live within their means, save for the future, and make smart financial choices, children can avoid the financial mistakes that many adults make. This can lead to a lifetime of financial security, independence, and peace of mind.In conclusion, teaching children to manage their own money at a young age is essential for their future financial well-being. By providing them with hands-on experience and teaching them essential financial skills, parents and caregivers can set them up for a lifetime of financial responsibility and success.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;In every country, people do dance for fun, for entertrain, and for decrease a stress. Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture. For instance, I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom, king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture. The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.;I strongly agree with the statement that dancing plays an important role in a culture. Dancing has been a vital part of human expression and identity across various cultures and throughout history. It serves as a powerful tool for communication, storytelling, and preserving traditions.One of the primary reasons dancing plays a crucial role in a culture is its ability to convey emotions, values, and customs. For instance, in traditional Indian classical dance, Bharatanatyam, intricate hand gestures and facial expressions narrate mythological stories and depict the culture's rich heritage. Similarly, in Japan, Kabuki dance is used to express dramatic emotions and highlight the country's unique theatrical traditions.Dancing also helps to preserve cultural identity and pass it down to future generations. In many African cultures, dance is an integral part of initiation rites, weddings, and harvest festivals. The energetic and rhythmic movements not only bring the community together but also teach younger members about their history and customs. In Hawaii, the traditional Hula dance has been a cornerstone of native culture, showcasing the island's unique history, spirituality, and connection with nature.Furthermore, dancing often transcends cultural boundaries, fostering cross-cultural understanding and exchange. International dance festivals and performances have become a platform for artists to share their traditions with global audiences. This has not only promoted cultural appreciation but also inspired innovation, as dancers experiment with fusion styles and techniques.In conclusion, dancing is indeed a vital component of a culture, playing a significant role in preserving traditions, expressing emotions, and fostering cross-cultural understanding. Through its dynamic movements and rhythmic beats, dance has the power to bring people together, celebrate cultural heritage, and inspire new artistic expressions.
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;The debate surrounding the importance of understanding ideas and concepts versus learning facts has been a longstanding one in the realm of education. While some may argue that learning facts is the primary goal of education, I firmly believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts.Understanding ideas and concepts allows students to think critically and solve problems effectively. When students are taught to grasp the underlying principles and concepts, they are able to apply them to a wide range of situations, making them more adaptable and resourceful learners. This approach to learning enables students to develop their analytical skills, evaluate information, and form their own opinions, rather than simply regurgitating facts.Moreover, understanding ideas and concepts fosters creativity and innovation. When students are encouraged to explore and understand abstract ideas, they are more likely to think outside the box and come up with novel solutions to complex problems. This, in turn, prepares them for the complexities of the real world, where they will be expected to navigate ambiguity and uncertainty.In contrast, learning facts, while important, can be limiting and restrictive. When students are solely focused on memorizing facts, they may struggle to apply them to new situations or think critically about the information. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancements and the sheer volume of information available today render facts increasingly obsolete, making it essential for students to develop a deeper understanding of concepts and ideas.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. By emphasizing conceptual understanding, we can equip students with the skills, creativity, and adaptability needed to succeed in an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;I strongly agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries at universities and colleges, and should receive equal financial support. While academic programs are the primary focus of institutions of higher learning, extracurricular activities play a vital role in enhancing the overall educational experience.Firstly, sports and social activities provide students with essential life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication. Participating in sports, for instance, teaches students discipline, perseverance, and time management, which are valuable assets in both personal and professional life. Moreover, social activities like volunteer work, cultural events, and club memberships foster a sense of community, promoting socialization, cultural awareness, and empathy among students from diverse backgrounds.Secondly, sports and social activities have been shown to have a positive impact on students' mental and physical health. Exercise and physical activity have been linked to reduced stress levels, improved mood, and enhanced cognitive function. Additionally, social connections and friendships formed through extracurricular activities can lead to increased happiness, self-esteem, and overall well-being.Lastly, universities and colleges that prioritize sports and social activities can reap significant benefits in terms of recruitment, retention, and alumni engagement. A well-rounded campus life can be a major draw for prospective students, while a strong sense of community can lead to increased student retention and loyalty among alumni.In conclusion, sports and social activities are essential components of the university experience, complementing academic programs and providing students with valuable skills, improved health, and a sense of belonging. Therefore, I firmly believe that these activities should receive equal financial support, enabling institutions to provide a holistic education that prepares students for success in all aspects of life.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way we access and disseminate information. While some individuals believe that the internet provides people with a wealth of valuable information, others argue that this excessive information can lead to problems. In my opinion, I agree with the latter view, as the unbridled access to information can create more issues than benefits.On the one hand, the internet undoubtedly offers a vast array of valuable information, enabling users to acquire knowledge and skills from the comfort of their own homes. For instance, online educational platforms and resources have democratized access to quality education, bridging the gap between privileged and underprivileged students. Moreover, the internet facilitates global connectivity, allowing people to stay updated on current events, news, and trends from around the world.However, I firmly believe that the unregulated access to information can lead to numerous problems. Firstly, the internet has given rise to the proliferation of misinformation and fake news, which can have severe consequences. For example, the spread of misinformation about vaccines has led to a decline in vaccination rates, resulting in the resurgence of preventable diseases. Secondly, the internet has also enabled the widespread dissemination of hate speech and propaganda, fostering a culture of intolerance and extremism. Furthermore, the excessive availability of information can lead to information overload, causing users to feel overwhelmed and struggling to discern credible sources from unreliable ones.In conclusion, while the internet does provide valuable information, the drawbacks of excessive information cannot be ignored. It is essential to acknowledge the potential problems associated with unbridled access to information and take steps to mitigate these issues, such as promoting media literacy and fact-checking initiatives. By doing so, we can harness the benefits of the internet while minimizing its negative consequences.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;The debate on whether universities should require students to take classes in many subjects or specialize in one subject has been ongoing for years. While some argue that specialization is the key to expertise, others believe that a well-rounded education is essential for success. In my opinion, requiring students to take classes in many subjects is the better approach.First and foremost, studying multiple subjects helps students develop a broader perspective and understanding of the world. By taking classes in various fields, students can identify connections and relationships between different subjects, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. For instance, a student majoring in biology may also take courses in chemistry, mathematics, and environmental science, gaining a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of these fields.Moreover, taking classes in multiple subjects allows students to explore different interests and passions, potentially leading to the discovery of new talents and career paths. Many students enter university unsure of their desired major, and by taking a variety of courses, they can make informed decisions about their academic and professional futures. For example, a student who initially intended to major in business may find a passion for psychology after taking an introductory course, leading them to switch majors and pursue a more fulfilling career.In contrast, specializing in one subject can lead to a narrow and limited education. While specialization can certainly lead to expertise, it can also result in a lack of creativity and innovation, as students may not be exposed to diverse ideas and perspectives. Furthermore, the job market is increasingly demanding employees with versatile skills and knowledge, making a well-rounded education essential for success.In conclusion, requiring students to take classes in many subjects is the better approach. By studying multiple subjects, students can develop a broader perspective, explore different interests, and gain a competitive edge in the job market. While specialization has its benefits, a well-rounded education is essential for success in today's fast-paced and interconnected world.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;The debate on whether governments should prioritize space exploration or focus on meeting the basic needs of their citizens on Earth is a contentious one. While some argue that exploring outer space is crucial for humanity's advancement, I firmly believe that governments should allocate their resources towards addressing the pressing needs of their people on Earth.Firstly, there are numerous challenges on our planet that require immediate attention and funding. Poverty, hunger, and lack of access to clean water and healthcare are just a few of the many issues that plague communities worldwide. By investing in these areas, governments can significantly improve the quality of life for their citizens, ensuring that everyone has access to basic necessities. In contrast, the benefits of space exploration, although groundbreaking, are more long-term and may not directly impact the daily lives of most people.Furthermore, the cost of space exploration is exorbitant, with NASA's budget alone exceeding $20 billion annually. This amount could be better spent on pressing issues such as education, infrastructure, and social welfare programs. Additionally, the environmental benefits of investing in sustainable technologies and renewable energy sources far outweigh the potential benefits of space exploration. By prioritizing these areas, governments can create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and ensure a cleaner, healthier environment for future generations.While space exploration has led to numerous scientific breakthroughs and innovations, I believe that governments should prioritize the basic needs of their citizens on Earth. By doing so, they can create a more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous society, where everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive. Only then can we consider exploring the vastness of space with a clear conscience, knowing that our own house is in order.

So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me. Consequently, I feel happy when I listen music.Second, another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise.

And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind.;"In today's fast-paced world, stress has become an inevitable part of modern life. With the constant pressure to perform, meet deadlines, and maintain a work-life balance, it's essential to find effective ways to reduce stress and maintain mental well-being. While people have different coping mechanisms, I believe that exercise, reading, and spending time in nature are among the best ways to alleviate stress.Exercise is an excellent stress-reducer, as it releases endorphins, also known as ""feel-good"" hormones, which boost mood and energy levels. Engaging in physical activities like running, swimming, or yoga not only distracts from daily worries but also improves sleep quality, a crucial factor in managing stress. For instance, a study by the American Psychological Association found that regular exercise reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression in individuals with chronic stress.Reading is another effective way to unwind and escape the pressures of modern life. Losing oneself in a book can be a therapeutic experience, allowing the mind to temporarily forget about daily concerns. Research has shown that reading can lower heart rate, blood pressure, and stress levels, making it an excellent stress-reduction technique. Moreover, reading can also broaden one's perspective, providing new insights and ideas to tackle life's challenges.Spending time in nature, whether it's walking in a park, hiking, or simply gardening, is also an excellent way to reduce stress. Being in nature has been shown to decrease cortisol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate, while improving mood and cognitive function. For example, a study by the University of East Anglia found that spending time in green spaces reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety in individuals with mental health conditions.In conclusion, while people have different ways of managing stress, I firmly believe that exercise, reading, and spending time in nature are among the most effective ways to reduce stress and improve mental well-being. By incorporating these activities into our daily routine, we can better cope with the demands of modern life and maintain a healthy, balanced lifestyle."
282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;The notion of paying teachers based on their students' performance has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that this approach would incentivize teachers to be more effective, I firmly disagree with the statement that teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn.Firstly, this approach oversimplifies the complex process of learning and teaching. Student performance is influenced by a multitude of factors, including their socio-economic background, parental support, and individual learning abilities. Teachers have limited control over these variables, making it unfair to hold them solely accountable for their students' progress. For instance, a teacher working in a disadvantaged school may face significant challenges in achieving the same academic outcomes as a teacher in a more affluent school.Secondly, linking teacher pay to student performance would lead to a culture of teaching to the test. Teachers would focus on drilling students to pass standardized exams rather than providing a well-rounded education that fosters critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. This narrow focus would ultimately undermine the quality of education and the students' overall learning experience.Finally, this approach would create a hostile and competitive work environment among teachers. Rather than collaborating and sharing best practices, teachers would be pitted against each other, vying for limited resources and recognition. This would erode the sense of community and camaraderie that is essential for effective teaching and student learning.In conclusion, while the intention behind paying teachers based on student performance may be to improve academic outcomes, it is a misguided approach that would have far-reaching negative consequences. Teachers should be valued and compensated for their hard work, dedication, and commitment to providing high-quality education, rather than being judged solely on their students' test scores.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;"The concept of reward and punishment in movies and television programs has been a topic of debate among audiences and critics alike. While some argue that good people should be rewarded and bad people should be punished in these programs, I disagree with this notion.Firstly, presenting stories in which good people are always rewarded and bad people are always punished can lead to unrealistic expectations and a lack of authenticity. Real life is full of complexities and gray areas, where sometimes good people face hardships and bad people go unpunished. Movies and television programs should reflect this complexity, rather than providing simplistic and predictable outcomes.Moreover, a strict adherence to rewarding good and punishing bad characters can stifle creativity and limit the types of stories that can be told. Some of the most iconic and thought-provoking stories in film and television history feature characters who are multifaceted and exist outside the realm of good and evil. For example, the character of Tony Soprano in ""The Sopranos"" is a complex and nuanced individual, whose morality is constantly called into question.Furthermore, presenting stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished can also have a didactic and patronizing tone. Audiences are not always looking for a clear moral message or a simplistic lesson, but rather a thought-provoking and engaging story. By allowing characters to exist in a moral gray area, movies and television programs can encourage critical thinking and spark meaningful discussions among audiences.In conclusion, while it may be tempting to present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished, this approach can lead to unrealistic expectations, stifle creativity, and result in a didactic tone. Instead, movies and television programs should aim to reflect the complexities of real life, allowing for nuanced and thought-provoking storytelling."
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;The rise of technology has revolutionized the way we learn, and distance learning and online computer classes have emerged as viable alternatives to traditional classroom learning. While some may argue that the benefits of face-to-face interaction in a classroom setting cannot be replicated, I firmly believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.One of the primary advantages of online learning is flexibility. With the ability to access course materials and lectures from anywhere with an internet connection, students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is particularly beneficial for those who have work or family commitments that prevent them from attending traditional classes. Additionally, online learning platforms can provide personalized learning experiences tailored to individual students' needs, which can lead to improved academic outcomes.Another significant benefit of online learning is accessibility. Students from remote or disadvantaged areas can access high-quality educational resources that may not be available to them otherwise. Online learning can also provide equal opportunities for students with disabilities, who may face barriers in traditional classroom settings.Furthermore, online learning can be more cost-effective than traditional classroom learning. With no need to maintain physical classrooms or pay for transportation, online learning platforms can reduce costs associated with education. This can lead to increased accessibility and affordability for students from lower-income backgrounds.While some may argue that online learning lacks the social interaction and human connection of traditional classroom learning, I believe that technology can provide alternative ways to facilitate communication and collaboration among students. Online discussion forums, video conferencing, and social media groups can provide opportunities for students to engage with each other and with instructors.In conclusion, distance learning and online computer classes offer numerous benefits, including flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. While there may be some drawbacks to online learning, I firmly believe that it should replace traditional classroom learning. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that online learning will become even more sophisticated and effective, providing high-quality educational experiences for students around the world.
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;Throughout my life, I have been fortunate enough to have had a plethora of experiences that have significantly shaped my outlook and the way I live today. One of the most pivotal experiences that comes to mind is volunteering at a local homeless shelter during my teenage years. Witnessing the struggles faced by those living on the streets opened my eyes to the harsh realities of poverty and the importance of empathy.This experience instilled in me a strong sense of gratitude for the privileges I had taken for granted. It taught me to appreciate the simple things in life and to be more mindful of the impact my actions have on those around me. As a result, I have become more compassionate and aware of the needs of others, often finding ways to contribute to my community in meaningful ways.Another significant experience that has shaped my outlook is traveling to different parts of the world. Immersing myself in various cultures and meeting people from diverse backgrounds broadened my perspective and challenged my assumptions about the world. I learned that despite our differences, we share a common humanity and that understanding and respect can bridge even the widest of cultural divides.These experiences have collectively taught me the value of living a life of purpose and intention. They have shown me that even the smallest actions can have a profound impact on those around me and that by living with empathy, compassion, and awareness, I can make a positive difference in the world. As I continue on my life's journey, I carry these lessons with me, striving to live a life that is guided by a sense of responsibility, gratitude, and a deep appreciation for the beauty and complexity of human experience.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;The age-old debate surrounding the most effective method of learning a foreign language has sparked intense discussion among linguists and learners alike. While some advocate for learning a foreign language in one's own country, others swear by the benefits of immersion in the country where the language is spoken. In this essay, we will delve into the advantages of each approach, and ultimately, present a case for why learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken is the superior method.On one hand, learning a foreign language in one's own country offers several advantages. For one, it provides a comfortable and familiar environment, allowing learners to focus on the language without the added stress of navigating an unfamiliar culture. Additionally, language classes in one's own country often provide a structured and systematic approach to learning, with experienced teachers and a set curriculum. This approach can be particularly beneficial for beginners who require a solid foundation in the language.On the other hand, learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken offers a wealth of benefits that cannot be replicated in a classroom setting. Immersion in the language and culture allows learners to pick up nuances and expressions that may not be taught in a traditional classroom. Moreover, interacting with native speakers on a daily basis enables learners to develop their speaking and listening skills rapidly. For instance, a learner of Spanish in Spain can engage in conversations with locals, watch Spanish TV shows, and read Spanish newspapers, thereby surrounding themselves with the language and accelerating their learning process.In conclusion, while learning a foreign language in one's own country has its advantages, the benefits of learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken far outweigh them. Immersion in the language and culture provides an unparalleled learning experience that can lead to rapid progress and a deeper understanding of the language.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would choose to improve the public transportation system. My hometown, like many others, faces significant traffic congestion, air pollution, and limited mobility options, particularly for low-income residents and the elderly. First and foremost, a well-organized public transportation system would significantly alleviate traffic congestion in our city. With more buses and trains, fewer people would need to rely on their personal vehicles, thus reducing the number of cars on the road and subsequently decreasing travel times. For instance, a friend of mine who commutes to school every day has to leave his house two hours before the start of school just to ensure he arrives on time due to unpredictable traffic. This could be avoided if public transportation was more efficient.Secondly, a reliable public transportation system would reduce air pollution and contribute to a cleaner environment. With fewer cars on the road, there would be less emission of pollutants into the atmosphere, making the air cleaner and healthier for residents to breathe. Additionally, this could also make my hometown a more attractive place to live for those who prioritize environmental sustainability.Lastly, upgrading the public transportation system would provide residents with better access to essential services and job opportunities. Many low-income residents and elderly people are unable to afford cars, making it difficult for them to travel to healthcare facilities, shopping centers, and workplaces. By providing them with affordable and convenient transportation options, the town would become more inclusive and equitable.In conclusion, improving the public transportation system in my hometown would have numerous benefits for residents, ranging from reduced traffic congestion and air pollution to increased mobility and access to essential services. By making this change, my hometown would become a more livable, sustainable, and equitable place for everyone.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;The idea of students evaluating their teachers has been a topic of debate among educators and policymakers. While some argue that it's essential for students to have a say in their learning experience, others believe that it may lead to unfair judgments. In my opinion, schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers, as it can have several benefits for both students and educators.Firstly, student evaluations can provide valuable feedback to teachers, helping them to identify areas of improvement. When students are asked to evaluate their teachers, they can provide insights into what teaching methods are effective and what areas need more attention. For instance, if a majority of students find a particular lesson or assignment confusing, the teacher can adjust their approach to better meet the students' needs. This feedback loop can lead to more effective teaching and improved student outcomes.Secondly, student evaluations can promote accountability and motivation among teachers. When teachers know that their performance will be evaluated by their students, they are more likely to be motivated to teach better and be more responsive to their students' needs. This, in turn, can lead to a more positive and productive learning environment.Thirdly, involving students in the evaluation process can help to empower them and give them a sense of ownership over their learning. When students feel that their opinions are valued, they are more likely to be engaged and invested in their education. This can lead to better academic performance and a more positive attitude towards learning.However, it's essential to ensure that student evaluations are conducted in a fair and constructive manner. Schools should provide clear guidelines on how to evaluate teachers and ensure that evaluations are anonymous to prevent biases and fear of repercussions.In conclusion, asking students to evaluate their teachers can have numerous benefits for both students and educators. It can lead to improved teaching, increased accountability, and a more positive learning environment. Therefore, I strongly agree that schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;"When it comes to choosing a work environment, individuals often find themselves torn between the stability of a large corporation and the agility of a small company. After careful consideration, I would prefer to work for a small company, and here's why.First and foremost, small companies offer a sense of community and camaraderie that is often lacking in large corporations. With fewer employees, everyone's contributions are valued, and teamwork is not just encouraged, but essential. In a small company, I would be more than just a cog in a machine; I would be a vital part of a tight-knit team working towards a common goal.Another advantage of working for a small company is the opportunity for growth and development. With fewer employees, there is less bureaucracy and red tape, allowing for more agile decision-making and a greater sense of autonomy. In a small company, I would have the freedom to take on new challenges, experiment with new ideas, and make a real impact on the organization. This, in turn, would provide me with invaluable learning experiences and skills that would be difficult to acquire in a larger corporation.Furthermore, small companies often have a more flexible and adaptable culture, which would allow me to work in a more dynamic and innovative environment. With the ability to pivot quickly in response to changing market conditions, I would be part of a company that is always pushing the boundaries of what is possible.In conclusion, while large corporations may offer stability and security, I believe that working for a small company would provide me with a more engaging, dynamic, and rewarding work environment. With the sense of community, opportunities for growth and development, and a flexible and adaptable culture, I believe that a small company would be the perfect fit for me."
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;"The debate over whether a college or university education should be available to all students or only to good students has been ongoing for years. On one hand, some people believe that higher education should be accessible to all students, regardless of their academic abilities. They argue that education is a fundamental right and that everyone deserves the opportunity to pursue their dreams. This view is based on the idea that education is essential for personal growth, social mobility, and economic development.On the other hand, others believe that higher education should be reserved for students who have demonstrated academic excellence. They argue that limited resources and the high cost of education mean that only the most capable students should be given the opportunity to attend university. According to this view, admitting students who are not academically prepared can lead to poor academic performance, high dropout rates, and a waste of resources.I agree with the view that a college or university education should be available to all students. While it is true that academic excellence is important, it is also important to recognize that students from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have had the same opportunities to develop their academic skills. Furthermore, university education is not just about academics; it is also about personal growth, socialization, and developing important life skills.Moreover, making higher education available to all students can help to promote social mobility and reduce inequality. By giving everyone access to education, we can create a more level playing field and provide opportunities for people from all backgrounds to succeed. In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that a college or university education should be available to all students, regardless of their academic abilities."
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;The idea that playing computer games is a waste of time and should be disallowed for students is a notion that has gained significant traction in recent years. As technology continues to advance, computer games have become increasingly popular among students, leading many to question the impact on their academic performance.One of the primary concerns is that excessive gaming can distract students from their studies, leading to a decline in academic achievement. Many students spend countless hours immersed in virtual worlds, neglecting their schoolwork and responsibilities. This can result in poor grades, missed deadlines, and a lack of engagement in the classroom.Furthermore, computer games can also lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to various health problems. Prolonged periods of inactivity can result in obesity, sleep deprivation, and social isolation. Students who spend too much time playing games may also miss out on other extracurricular activities that can foster social skills, teamwork, and physical fitness.However, it is also worth noting that some computer games, especially educational ones, can be beneficial for students. They can improve problem-solving skills, hand-eye coordination, and multitasking abilities. Moreover, games can also serve as a tool for relaxation and stress relief, which is essential for students' mental health.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the impact of computer games on students, an outright ban is not the solution. Rather, schools and parents should encourage students to maintain a healthy balance between gaming and academic responsibilities. By setting limits and promoting responsible gaming habits, students can enjoy the benefits of gaming while also excelling academically.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;The question of whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email has been a topic of discussion in recent years. In my opinion, I firmly believe that working on projects in person is more effective than doing so via email.When working on a project in person, team members can communicate more effectively and efficiently. Face-to-face interactions allow for non-verbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, to convey emotions and ideas. This can help prevent misunderstandings and miscommunications that can often occur through email. Additionally, in-person meetings facilitate brainstorming and creative problem-solving, as team members can feed off each other's ideas and energy.In contrast, working on a project via email can be isolating and slow. Emails can be easily misinterpreted or overlooked, leading to delays and frustration. Moreover, email communication lacks the spontaneity and creativity that comes with in-person interactions. Team members may also feel less accountable and motivated when working on a project remotely, which can negatively impact the overall quality of the project.Furthermore, in-person collaboration allows team members to build trust and establish relationships, which is essential for successful teamwork. When team members work together in person, they can develop a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose, which can lead to a more enjoyable and productive work experience.However, it is worth noting that there may be situations where email collaboration is necessary, such as when team members are geographically dispersed or have conflicting schedules. In these cases, email communication can be a useful tool for keeping team members informed and on track.In conclusion, while email communication has its advantages, I firmly believe that working on projects in person is more effective and beneficial for team members. The face-to-face interaction, creativity, and sense of camaraderie that come with in-person collaboration make it an essential aspect of successful teamwork.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;The role of university professors is multifaceted, encompassing both research and education. While some argue that professors should prioritize research, others contend that their primary focus should be on educating students. In my opinion, a balanced approach that integrates both aspects is essential for the overall growth and development of students.On one hand, research is crucial for professors to stay updated with the latest developments in their field and to contribute meaningfully to the academic community. It not only enhances their knowledge but also enables them to impart cutting-edge information to their students. Professors who engage in research are more likely to be enthusiastic and motivated, which can positively impact their teaching methods. Moreover, research-oriented professors can provide students with opportunities to participate in research projects, fostering their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.On the other hand, educating students is the primary responsibility of university professors. Students attend university to acquire knowledge, skills, and guidance from experienced professors. If professors focus excessively on research, they may neglect their teaching duties, which can compromise the quality of education. Effective teaching requires professors to be approachable, available, and willing to provide individualized attention to students. Furthermore, professors who prioritize teaching can create a supportive learning environment, encouraging students to ask questions, explore ideas, and develop their interests.In conclusion, I firmly believe that university professors should strike a balance between research and education. By allocating sufficient time to both aspects, professors can provide students with a comprehensive learning experience while also contributing to the advancement of their field. Ultimately, this balanced approach will benefit not only the students but also the academic community at large, as it will lead to the development of well-rounded, inquisitive, and skilled individuals who are equipped to make a positive impact in their chosen careers.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;The debate on whether individuals learn better by themselves or with a teacher has been ongoing. While some argue that self-directed learning is the most effective way to absorb knowledge, others claim that having a teacher provides numerous benefits that enhance the learning experience.On one hand, learning by oneself can be a highly effective way to acquire knowledge. With the advent of technology, there is an abundance of resources available online, allowing individuals to learn at their own pace and convenience. Self-directed learning also encourages autonomy, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, as individuals are forced to navigate through challenges on their own. Moreover, some people may find that they are able to focus better and retain information more effectively when learning independently.On the other hand, having a teacher can provide numerous benefits that may not be available through self-directed learning. A teacher can offer personalized guidance, feedback, and support, which can be particularly beneficial for students who struggle with certain concepts or need additional help. Teachers can also provide a structured learning environment, setting clear goals and expectations, and helping students stay motivated and on track. Furthermore, teachers can facilitate discussions, debates, and group work, promoting social skills, teamwork, and communication.Ultimately, the most effective way to learn is often a combination of both self-directed learning and teacher guidance. While some students may excel in a self-directed learning environment, others may benefit from the support and structure provided by a teacher. By incorporating elements of both approaches, individuals can maximize their learning potential and achieve their academic goals.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with one another. While it was initially designed to simplify our lives, it has ironically led to increased complexity in various aspects of our daily lives. This phenomenon is evident in the way technology has impacted our communication, work-life balance, and mental health.On the surface, technology appears to have simplified communication by providing us with multiple platforms to connect with others. However, the plethora of options has led to a state of perpetual distraction, where individuals are constantly switching between social media, email, and messaging apps. This has resulted in a culture of instant gratification, where people expect immediate responses, leading to increased stress and anxiety.Furthermore, technology has blurred the lines between work and personal life, making it increasingly difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. The constant availability of work-related tasks and notifications has led to an expectation of perpetual availability, making it challenging for individuals to disengage from work-related activities. This has resulted in increased burnout and decreased productivity, as individuals struggle to disconnect from the demands of work.Lastly, the impact of technology on mental health is a significant concern. The constant stream of information and the pressure to present a curated online persona have led to increased feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. The constant exposure to social media has also led to a culture of comparison, where individuals feel pressured to compare their lives to the highlight reels of others.In conclusion, while technology was designed to simplify our lives, it has ultimately led to increased complexity in various aspects of our daily lives. As we continue to develop and integrate technology into our lives, it is essential to recognize these unintended consequences and strive for a balance between technology use and personal well-being. By acknowledging these challenges, we can work towards harnessing the benefits of technology while minimizing its negative impacts.
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";The proliferation of distance-learning programs has revolutionized the education landscape, offering unprecedented flexibility and accessibility to students worldwide. However, the debate surrounding their efficacy compared to traditional in-person attendance at colleges and universities persists. While some argue that distance-learning programs are inferior to their traditional counterparts, I disagree to a significant extent.On one hand, it is undeniable that in-person attendance provides students with invaluable opportunities for face-to-face interactions, socialization, and hands-on learning experiences. Direct engagement with instructors and peers can facilitate deeper understanding, foster critical thinking, and promote emotional intelligence. Moreover, traditional campuses often provide access to state-of-the-art facilities, libraries, and research resources, which can be essential for academic growth.On the other hand, distance-learning programs have made tremendous strides in recent years, offering high-quality, engaging, and interactive educational experiences. With the aid of technology, students can now access a vast array of courses, degree programs, and online resources that cater to diverse learning styles and needs. Furthermore, distance learning allows students to balance academic pursuits with work, family, or other responsibilities, making higher education more inclusive and accessible.Moreover, many distance-learning programs have incorporated innovative features such as virtual labs, simulations, and online mentorship, which can rival the traditional learning experience. Additionally, the flexibility and autonomy offered by distance learning can foster self-motivation, time management, and discipline – essential skills for success in today's fast-paced, technology-driven world.In conclusion, while traditional in-person attendance offers unique benefits, I firmly believe that distance-learning programs are a viable and effective alternative. As technology continues to advance and online education evolves, the gap between traditional and distance learning will likely narrow. Ultimately, the quality of an educational program depends on various factors, including the institution, instructors, and individual student commitment, rather than the mode of delivery.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";The debate about whether teenagers should have jobs while still in school has sparked intense discussion among educators, policymakers, and parents. While some argue that having a job as a teenager is a valuable learning experience, others claim that it can negatively impact their academic performance. In my opinion, I believe that having a job as a teenager can be beneficial, but only if it is managed effectively.On the one hand, having a job as a teenager can provide valuable skills and experience that are not typically taught in the classroom. For instance, a part-time job can teach teenagers important life skills such as time management, communication, and teamwork. Additionally, earning a steady income can also instill a sense of responsibility and independence in teenagers, allowing them to make informed financial decisions and manage their own finances. Furthermore, having a job can also provide teenagers with opportunities to explore different career paths and interests, helping them make informed decisions about their future.On the other hand, having a job as a teenager can also have negative consequences if not managed effectively. For example, if a teenager's job demands too much of their time and energy, it can negatively impact their academic performance. Moreover, if a teenager is not able to balance their schoolwork and job effectively, it can lead to increased stress and anxiety.In conclusion, I believe that having a job as a teenager can be a valuable learning experience if managed effectively. It can provide important life skills, independence, and opportunities to explore different career paths. However, it is essential for teenagers to strike a balance between their schoolwork and job to avoid negative consequences. Ultimately, with proper time management and support from family and educators, having a job as a teenager can be a beneficial experience that sets them up for future success.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;The age-old debate surrounding language acquisition has sparked intense discussion among linguists and language learners alike. When it comes to learning a foreign language, two primary approaches have emerged: learning in one's own country versus immersion in the country where the language is spoken. While both methods have their advantages, I firmly believe that learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken is the more effective approach.Learning a foreign language in one's own country has several benefits. For one, it provides a comfortable and familiar environment, allowing learners to focus on the language without the added stress of adapting to a new culture. Additionally, language courses in one's own country often offer structured lessons, trained instructors, and access to resources such as textbooks and language learning software. However, despite these advantages, learning a foreign language in one's own country can lack the authenticity and practical application that comes with immersion.On the other hand, learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken offers unparalleled benefits. Surrounding oneself with native speakers, cultural nuances, and everyday situations provides learners with a rich and immersive language learning experience. In-country language learners are able to practice their language skills in real-life situations, such as ordering food, navigating public transportation, and engaging in conversations with locals. This immersive environment fosters a deeper understanding of the language, its idioms, and its cultural context. Furthermore, learners are able to receive instant feedback and correction from native speakers, which is invaluable in refining their language skills.In conclusion, while learning a foreign language in one's own country has its advantages, I firmly believe that learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken provides a more comprehensive and effective language learning experience. Immersion in the language and culture offers learners a unique opportunity to develop their language skills in a practical and authentic way, ultimately leading to greater language proficiency and cultural understanding.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;"The debate about the ideal vacation structure for students has sparked intense discussion among educators and students alike. While some advocate for a single, extended break each year, others argue that multiple short vacations are more beneficial. In my opinion, I firmly believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year.One of the primary reasons for this is that shorter, more frequent breaks can help prevent burnout. A long, grueling academic year without adequate respite can lead to mental and physical exhaustion, ultimately hindering a student's ability to focus and learn effectively. By providing regular breaks, students can recharge and refocus, ensuring they maintain a healthy work-life balance and optimal academic performance.Furthermore, multiple short vacations can offer students more opportunities for relaxation, exploration, and personal growth. For instance, a week-long break can provide ample time for a family trip or a chance to pursue hobbies and interests outside of academics. This can help students develop valuable life skills, such as independence, time management, and self-reliance, which are essential for future success.In contrast, a single, extended vacation can lead to a phenomenon known as the ""summer learning loss,"" where students often forget or struggle to recall previously learned material due to prolonged disengagement from academics. By providing regular breaks, students can stay engaged with their studies and retain information more effectively.In conclusion, while a single, extended vacation may seem appealing, I firmly believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. This structure can help prevent burnout, offer opportunities for relaxation and growth, and ultimately, promote better academic performance."
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";"I completely agree with the statement that ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. This expression, famously coined by Winston Churchill, serves as a powerful reminder that persistence and determination are key to achieving success.One of the most compelling reasons to support this statement is that every individual faces setbacks and failures at some point in their lives. However, it is how one responds to these obstacles that truly defines their character. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is a prime example of this. He reportedly failed over 1,000 times before successfully creating the light bulb, yet he never gave up. His perseverance paid off, and his invention revolutionized the world.Another reason why this statement holds true is that it promotes a growth mindset. When we encounter difficulties, we have two options: either give up or learn from our mistakes and keep moving forward. By choosing the latter, we develop resilience, a vital quality for overcoming challenges. J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, was rejected by twelve publishers before one finally agreed to publish her book. If she had given up, the world would have missed out on a literary phenomenon.In conclusion, the expression ""Never, never give up"" is more than just a motivational phrase - it is a way of life. It reminds us that our goals are worth fighting for, even when the journey gets tough. By adopting this mindset, we can overcome any obstacle and achieve our aspirations. As the Japanese proverb goes, ""Fall seven times, stand up eight."""
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;The age-old debate about whether to enjoy one's money upon earning it or save it for the future has been a topic of discussion among individuals. While some argue that enjoying one's money immediately is the best approach, others contend that saving for the future is more prudent. In my opinion, it is better to strike a balance between the two, as each approach has its own merits.Enjoying one's money immediately allows individuals to appreciate the fruits of their labor and take advantage of experiences and opportunities that may not be available in the future. For instance, traveling or pursuing hobbies can enrich one's life and create lasting memories. Moreover, spending money can also boost the economy and create jobs. For example, a person who chooses to spend their bonus on a vacation can support local businesses and contribute to the tourism industry.On the other hand, saving for the future is crucial for financial security and peace of mind. Having a safety net can provide individuals with the freedom to pursue their passions and take calculated risks. For example, saving for a down payment on a house can provide a sense of stability and reduce financial stress. Additionally, saving for retirement can ensure that individuals can maintain their standard of living in their golden years.Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance between enjoying one's money and saving for the future. By allocating a portion of one's income towards savings and investments, individuals can ensure financial security while still enjoying the present moment. This approach allows individuals to appreciate the value of their hard work while also planning for the future. By finding this balance, individuals can reap the benefits of both enjoying their money and saving for the future, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and secure life.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;The world is divided into two types of individuals: those who rush through life and those who savor every moment. While some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done, others prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. As a person who values balance and productivity, I prefer to take my time and live life at a slower pace.One of the primary reasons I prefer a slower pace is that it allows me to be more mindful and present in the moment. When we rush through life, we often miss out on the small joys and details that make life worth living. By taking my time, I can appreciate the beauty of nature, enjoy meaningful conversations with loved ones, and focus on the task at hand without distractions. For instance, when I'm studying for an exam, I find that taking my time to review notes and practice problems helps me retain information better and perform well on the test.Another reason I prefer a slower pace is that it promotes better time management and prioritization. When we're in a hurry, we often take on too much and end up procrastinating or making mistakes. By taking my time, I can prioritize tasks, break them down into manageable chunks, and focus on one thing at a time. This approach has helped me manage my coursework, extracurricular activities, and part-time job without feeling overwhelmed.Lastly, a slower pace is essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance. When we're always in a hurry, we often neglect our physical and mental well-being. By taking my time, I can make time for exercise, meditation, and spending quality time with loved ones. This balance is crucial for maintaining my overall well-being and enjoying life to the fullest.In conclusion, while some people may thrive in a fast-paced environment, I prefer to take my time and live life at a slower pace. By being more mindful, prioritizing tasks, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance, I can appreciate the beauty of life and make the most of every moment.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;The debate surrounding human needs versus conservation of land for endangered animals has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry take precedence, I firmly disagree with this viewpoint. The preservation of land for endangered animals is crucial for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the long-term sustainability of our planet.Firstly, endangered species play a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems. The loss of a single species can have a ripple effect throughout the entire ecosystem, leading to unforeseen and potentially disastrous consequences. For instance, the decline of pollinators such as bees has severe implications for global food production. By preserving land for endangered species, we are also safeguarding the health of our ecosystems.Secondly, conservation efforts often have positive economic benefits. Protected areas can generate income through eco-tourism, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. In Africa, for example, wildlife reserves have become a significant source of income for local communities, providing an incentive for conservation. Moreover, the preservation of natural habitats also helps to maintain biodiversity, which is essential for the development of new medicines and other innovations.Finally, the idea that human needs and conservation are mutually exclusive is a false dichotomy. With careful planning and management, it is possible to balance human needs with conservation goals. For example, agroforestry practices can combine farmland with reforestation efforts, while innovative urban planning can incorporate green spaces into housing developments.In conclusion, while human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are important, they should not come at the expense of preserving land for endangered animals. The long-term benefits of conservation, including ecosystem health, economic benefits, and biodiversity, far outweigh the short-term gains of prioritizing human needs above all else.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;The age-old debate about whether university students should be required to attend classes or not has been a topic of discussion among educators and students alike. While some argue that attending classes should be mandatory, I firmly believe that it should be optional for students. In my opinion, this approach has several benefits that can enhance the overall learning experience of students.First and foremost, making classes optional allows students to take ownership of their learning. University students are adults who are capable of managing their time and prioritizing their tasks. By giving them the freedom to choose whether or not to attend classes, they can develop a sense of responsibility and accountability for their own learning. This, in turn, can lead to a more motivated and engaged student body.Another advantage of making classes optional is that it allows students to learn at their own pace. Some students may prefer to learn through online resources, textbooks, or one-on-one interactions with instructors, rather than in a traditional classroom setting. By not requiring attendance, students can choose the learning method that best suits their needs and learning style.Furthermore, optional classes can also help reduce the financial burden on students. Attending classes on campus can be expensive, especially for students who have to commute from far-off locations. By providing students with the option to learn from home or in a setting that is more convenient for them, universities can make higher education more accessible and affordable.In conclusion, while some may argue that requiring university students to attend classes is necessary for their academic success, I firmly believe that making classes optional is the way forward. By giving students the freedom to choose how they want to learn, universities can foster a more motivated, responsible, and self-directed student body.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;The advent of technology has brought about a significant transformation in the way people live, work, and interact with one another. While some argue that technology has made people's lives more complicated, I firmly believe that it has made our lives simpler in numerous ways.First and foremost, technology has streamlined many mundane tasks, freeing up time and energy for more meaningful pursuits. For instance, online banking and shopping have eliminated the need for physical visits to banks and stores, saving time and reducing stress. Moreover, mobile apps have simplified tasks such as booking appointments, ordering food, and paying bills, making life more convenient.Technology has also revolutionized communication, enabling people to stay connected with others across the globe. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools have made it possible to communicate with friends, family, and colleagues instantly, regardless of geographical distance. This has not only simplified communication but also fostered global connections and collaborations.Furthermore, technology has improved access to information and knowledge, making it easier to learn new skills and expand our understanding of the world. Online resources such as e-books, tutorials, and educational websites have democratized access to knowledge, enabling people to acquire new skills and knowledge at their own pace.In addition, technology has also improved healthcare outcomes by enabling remote consultations, telemedicine, and online health monitoring. This has simplified healthcare access, especially for people with mobility issues or those living in remote areas.In conclusion, while technology may present some challenges, its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. By simplifying tasks, communication, and access to information, technology has undoubtedly made people's lives simpler. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely to bring about even more innovative solutions to everyday problems, making life even more convenient and enjoyable.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";The attention given to the personal lives of famous individuals by the media has been a topic of discussion for years. In my opinion, I agree with the statement that television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities.One reason for this is that the constant coverage of their personal lives often overshadows their professional achievements. For instance, a renowned actor's latest film release may be overshadowed by news of their divorce or a feud with another celebrity. This not only takes away from the real talent and hard work that these individuals put into their craft, but also sets a poor example for the public. The constant stream of gossip and scandals can lead to a distorted view of what is truly important and newsworthy.Another reason is that the excessive attention to celebrities' personal lives can lead to invasion of their privacy. The media often crosses the line, revealing intimate details about their relationships, health, and personal struggles. This not only causes emotional distress to the celebrities but also sets a dangerous precedent for how we treat public figures. It perpetuates a culture where their private lives are seen as fair game for public consumption.Additionally, the focus on celebrities' personal lives can also have a negative impact on society as a whole. It creates a culture of celebrity worship, where the public becomes more interested in the personal lives of these individuals than in real issues that affect their communities. This can lead to a lack of engagement in meaningful topics and a decrease in critical thinking.In conclusion, while it is natural for the public to be curious about the lives of famous individuals, I believe that the media pays too much attention to their personal lives. It is essential for the media to strike a balance between reporting on their professional achievements and respecting their private lives.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;When it comes to deciding between staying in one place and moving in search of another, I find myself torn between the comfort of familiarity and the thrill of exploration. On one hand, staying in one place provides a sense of security and stability. It allows us to establish a routine, build strong relationships, and become an integral part of a community. We can put down roots, watch ourselves grow, and see the world around us change. Furthermore, staying in one place also allows us to focus on personal growth, as we can devote our time and energy to developing our skills, pursuing our passions, and achieving our goals.On the other hand, moving in search of another place offers a world of possibilities and opportunities. It allows us to break free from the constraints of our current environment, challenge ourselves, and discover new aspects of ourselves. We can experience different cultures, meet new people, and broaden our perspectives. Moving also provides us with the chance to reinvent ourselves, to start anew, and to pursue fresh opportunities. Whether it's a new job, a new education, or a new lifestyle, moving gives us the chance to create a better life for ourselves.For me, the ideal choice would be a balance between the two. While I appreciate the comfort and security of staying in one place, I also crave the excitement and adventure of moving to a new place. Perhaps, the best approach would be to have a home base, a place where we can always return to, but also be open to exploring new destinations and experiencing different ways of life. Ultimately, whether we choose to stay or move, what's most important is that we make the choice that best aligns with our personal goals, aspirations, and values.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;When it comes to choosing a place to live, university students are often faced with two primary options: university dormitories and apartments in the community. Both options have their advantages, but they also cater to different needs and preferences.On the one hand, living in university dormitories offers several advantages. Firstly, it provides students with a sense of community and belonging, as they are surrounded by fellow students who share similar interests and goals. University dormitories also offer a range of amenities, such as study spaces, recreational facilities, and meal plans, which can make life easier and more convenient for students. Additionally, living on campus can be more cost-effective, as students do not have to worry about transportation costs or utility bills.On the other hand, living in an apartment in the community offers a different set of advantages. For one, it provides students with more independence and freedom, as they are not bound by the rules and regulations of university dormitories. Apartments also offer more space and flexibility, allowing students to live with friends or family members, and to decorate and furnish their own space. Furthermore, living in the community can provide students with a more authentic and immersive experience of the local culture, as they are able to engage with the local community and participate in local events.Personally, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community. I value my independence and freedom, and I believe that living in an apartment would allow me to develop important life skills, such as cooking, cleaning, and budgeting. Additionally, I think that living in the community would provide me with a more well-rounded and enriching experience, as I would be able to engage with the local culture and meet people from different backgrounds and walks of life. While university dormitories offer a sense of community and convenience, I believe that the advantages of living in an apartment outweigh those of living on campus.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;"The notion that it is more crucial to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and ensure accuracy is a contentious issue in today's fast-paced world. While some may argue that speed is paramount, I firmly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, it is still essential to prioritize accuracy and thoroughness over expediency.First and foremost, mistakes can have severe consequences, particularly in fields such as medicine, engineering, and finance. In these professions, errors can lead to loss of life, financial ruin, or catastrophic damage to infrastructure. Working slowly and methodically may take more time, but it ensures that professionals can detect and rectify potential mistakes before they cause harm. In contrast, rushing through tasks can lead to reckless decisions and avoidable blunders.Moreover, the emphasis on speed can also lead to burnout and decreased productivity. When individuals are pressured to work quickly, they often sacrifice attention to detail and overall quality. This can result in subpar work that requires rework or revisions, ultimately wasting more time and resources in the long run. On the other hand, working at a moderate pace allows individuals to maintain their focus and energy levels, leading to more efficient and effective work.Furthermore, in today's digital age, the concept of ""speed"" is often associated with innovation and progress. However, this notion is misguided. True innovation and progress come from careful planning, research, and testing – not hasty decisions and reckless experimentation. In fact, some of the most groundbreaking discoveries and achievements in human history were the result of meticulous effort and perseverance, not speed.In conclusion, while speed may be a valuable asset in certain situations, it should not come at the expense of accuracy and quality. In today's world, it is still more important to work slowly and ensure that everything is correct, rather than risking mistakes and compromising the outcome."
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;I disagree with the notion that university students do not need to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam. While passing exams is a crucial aspect of academic success, attending classes provides numerous benefits that extend beyond mere exam results.Firstly, attending classes allows students to engage with the material on a deeper level. University courses often cover complex and nuanced topics, and classroom discussions facilitate a richer understanding of these concepts. Interacting with instructors and peers enables students to ask questions, clarify doubts, and gain multiple perspectives on the subject matter. This interactive learning experience is difficult to replicate through self-study alone.Secondly, attending classes helps students develop essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration. Class discussions and group work foster critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as students learn to analyze information, evaluate arguments, and articulate their own opinions. Furthermore, participating in class activities and group projects promotes teamwork, communication, and time management skills – all of which are valuable assets in professional and personal life.Lastly, attending classes provides students with access to valuable resources and networks. University professors and guest lecturers often have extensive industry connections and research expertise, which can be leveraged for internships, job opportunities, or research collaborations. Moreover, classmates and peers can become a lifelong network of contacts and mentors, offering support, advice, and potential collaborations.While passing exams is certainly important, attending classes offers a more comprehensive learning experience that goes beyond mere academic success. By engaging with the material, developing essential skills, and accessing valuable resources and networks, university students can gain a richer, more well-rounded education that prepares them for success in their chosen field. Therefore, I firmly believe that attending classes is an essential aspect of the university experience.
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;The issue of whether universities should allocate more funds to professors' salaries in order to enhance the quality of education has sparked intense debate. In my opinion, I wholeheartedly agree with the statement that increasing professors' salaries is a crucial step towards elevating the standard of education in universities.First and foremost, a significant proportion of university professors are highly educated and experienced individuals, possessing a deep understanding of their respective fields. They dedicate an enormous amount of time and effort to imparting their knowledge and skills to students. It is only fair that they receive a salary that reflects their expertise, qualifications, and dedication. Currently, many professors face financial constraints due to inadequate compensation, which can lead to dissatisfaction, low morale, and ultimately, a compromised quality of education. By increasing their salaries, universities can attract and retain top talent, resulting in better learning outcomes for students.Furthermore, investing in professors' salaries would allow them to focus more on teaching and research, rather than being preoccupied with securing additional income through external means. This, in turn, would enable them to develop innovative teaching methods, invest in their research, and provide individualized attention to students, ultimately enhancing the overall educational experience.Additionally, numerous studies have demonstrated a direct correlation between professors' salaries and student performance. For instance, a study by the American Association of University Professors revealed that universities with higher faculty salaries tend to achieve higher graduation rates and student satisfaction levels. This suggests that investing in professors' salaries not only benefits the educators themselves but also has a positive impact on students' academic success.In conclusion, increasing professors' salaries is a vital strategy for universities seeking to enhance the quality of education. By doing so, they can attract top faculty, improve teaching methods, and ultimately, contribute to better student outcomes. Therefore, I strongly agree that universities should allocate more funds to professors' salaries to elevate the standard of education and reap the numerous benefits that follow.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;The notion that pets should be treated like family members has gained significant attention in recent years. As a society, we have come to recognize the importance of animals in our lives, and many of us have begun to treat them as an integral part of our families. In this essay, I will argue that pets should indeed be treated like family members, and I will provide several reasons to support this claim.First and foremost, pets provide companionship and emotional support to their owners. They offer a sense of belonging and love, which is essential for human well-being. Studies have shown that pets can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression in their owners, and they can even help people with mental health conditions. By treating pets like family members, we acknowledge the significant role they play in our emotional lives.Furthermore, pets rely on their owners for care and protection, just like children do. They need food, shelter, and medical attention, and it is our responsibility to provide these necessities. By treating pets like family members, we ensure that they receive the care and attention they need to thrive.In addition, treating pets like family members promotes a sense of responsibility and compassion in our society. When we treat pets with respect and kindness, we set an example for others to do the same. This can lead to a more empathetic and caring society, where animals are valued and protected.In conclusion, I strongly agree that pets should be treated like family members. They provide companionship, emotional support, and rely on us for care and protection. By treating them with respect and kindness, we promote a sense of responsibility and compassion in our society. As a society, we should continue to recognize the importance of animals in our lives and treat them with the love and care they deserve.
313;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind. Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace. I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.Primarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.Secondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. Besides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.To sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.;I disagree with the statement that in today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. While speed and efficiency are undoubtedly crucial in various aspects of life, prioritizing accuracy and attention to detail is often more beneficial in the long run.Firstly, mistakes can have severe consequences, particularly in fields such as medicine, engineering, and finance. A rushed decision or action can lead to catastrophic outcomes, resulting in harm to individuals, damage to infrastructure, or significant financial losses. For instance, a surgeon who operates hastily without properly assessing a patient's condition may cause irreparable harm, while a financial analyst who hastily reviews a company's financial records may make incorrect investment decisions.Secondly, working slowly and meticulously often leads to better learning and personal growth. When individuals take their time to complete tasks, they are more likely to understand the underlying principles and concepts, allowing them to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter. This, in turn, enables them to apply their knowledge more effectively in the future. For example, a student who thoroughly researches and prepares for an exam is more likely to retain the information and perform well in the long term, rather than one who hastily cramming for the exam.Finally, while speed is important in today's fast-paced world, it is not always the most critical factor. In many cases, quality and accuracy take precedence over speed. Employers often value employees who produce high-quality work, even if it takes longer to complete, over those who rush through tasks and produce subpar results.In conclusion, while speed is important, it should not come at the expense of accuracy and attention to detail. Prioritizing quality and taking the time to ensure that everything is correct is often more beneficial in the long run, particularly in fields where mistakes can have severe consequences.
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;When it comes to choosing the ideal place to live, opinions are often divided between small towns and big cities. While some people prefer the tranquility and closeness of a small town, I would personally prefer to live in a big city. In my opinion, the benefits of living in a big city far outweigh those of living in a small town.First and foremost, big cities offer unparalleled access to job opportunities and career advancement. With a diverse range of industries and companies, individuals have a wider range of options to choose from, increasing their chances of finding a job that suits their skills and interests. Additionally, big cities are often hubs for innovation and entrepreneurship, providing a platform for people to turn their ideas into reality.Another significant advantage of living in a big city is the availability of cultural and entertainment options. From world-class museums and theaters to diverse restaurants and music venues, big cities offer a vibrant cultural scene that caters to all interests. This diversity is also reflected in the people who live in big cities, providing a unique opportunity to interact with individuals from different backgrounds and cultures.In contrast to small towns, big cities also offer a higher level of convenience and efficiency. With well-developed public transportation systems and a wide range of amenities, individuals can easily access the services they need without having to rely on personal vehicles. Furthermore, big cities often have advanced healthcare facilities and emergency services, providing peace of mind for residents.In conclusion, while small towns have their own charm and benefits, I firmly believe that living in a big city offers the most advantages. From career opportunities and cultural diversity to convenience and access to services, big cities provide an unparalleled quality of life that is hard to match.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";I strongly disagree with the statement that it is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes. While new buildings may serve practical purposes, preserving historic and traditional structures is essential for maintaining a nation's cultural heritage, identity, and sense of community.Historic buildings and homes are tangible links to a country's past, providing a unique window into its history, architecture, and way of life. They are often irreplaceable and invaluable, holding sentimental and emotional significance for the people who live among them. By preserving these structures, governments can help to safeguard the collective memory of a nation, allowing future generations to learn from and appreciate their rich cultural legacy.In contrast, new buildings, no matter how functional or efficient, are often generic and lack the character and charm of historic buildings. They can also contribute to the erosion of a community's unique identity, as traditional neighborhoods are replaced by soulless, modern developments.Furthermore, preserving historic buildings can also have economic benefits, as restored structures can attract tourists, support local businesses, and create jobs. In many cities, historic districts have become popular destinations, generating significant revenue and helping to revitalize urban areas.In conclusion, while new buildings may be necessary for modernization and development, it is more important for governments to prioritize the preservation of historic and traditional buildings and homes. By doing so, they can protect a nation's cultural heritage, promote community identity, and support local economies.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;"I strongly agree with the statement that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. In retrospect, many of the challenging situations we face ultimately shape us into the individuals we are today, providing invaluable wisdom and insights that aid us in navigating future obstacles.One of the most significant examples of this phenomenon is failure. When we experience failure, it can be disheartening and seem insurmountable at the time. However, it often serves as a catalyst for growth, prompting us to reassess our approach, identify mistakes, and strive for improvement. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, famously said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" His perseverance in the face of failure ultimately led to one of the most groundbreaking inventions in history.Moreover, difficult experiences can foster resilience and adaptability, essential qualities for overcoming future challenges. For instance, individuals who have endured financial hardship often develop prudent financial habits and a deeper appreciation for the value of money. Similarly, those who have navigated tumultuous relationships may develop stronger communication skills and a greater understanding of their own emotional needs.In conclusion, the notion that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future is undeniably true. Through failure, perseverance, and the development of resilience and adaptability, we can transform our struggles into opportunities for growth and self-improvement. As the ancient Greek philosopher, Heraclitus, once said, ""The only thing that is constant is change."" By embracing this inevitable aspect of life, we can harness the power of difficult experiences to forge a brighter, wiser, and more resilient future."
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";The concept of charging drivers a fee for driving in busy city streets during peak hours has been a topic of debate in recent years. While some argue that it is an effective way to manage traffic congestion, others see it as an unfair penalty on drivers. In this essay, I will argue in favor of the statement, stating that drivers should indeed pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.First and foremost, charging drivers a fee for driving in congested areas can significantly reduce traffic congestion. By introducing a fee, drivers are incentivized to seek alternative routes or modes of transportation, such as carpooling or public transport. This, in turn, reduces the number of vehicles on the road, making it easier for others to navigate through the city. Moreover, the revenue generated from these fees can be used to improve public transportation and road infrastructure, further reducing congestion and making the city more livable.Another argument in favor of the statement is that it promotes a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly approach to transportation. By discouraging drivers from using their vehicles in congested areas, the fee encourages the use of cleaner modes of transportation, such as electric or hybrid vehicles, or even cycling and walking. This not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also improves air quality, making the city a healthier place to live.However, some may argue that the fee is unfair to those who rely on their vehicles for work or other essential activities. Nevertheless, I believe that the benefits of reduced congestion and improved air quality outweigh the costs. Moreover, governments can implement measures to mitigate the impact on low-income drivers, such as offering discounts or exemptions.In conclusion, I strongly agree with the statement that drivers should pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic. Not only does it reduce congestion and promote sustainability, but it also generates revenue that can be used to improve the city's infrastructure and transportation systems.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";The transition from adolescence to adulthood can be a challenging and overwhelming experience for many teenagers. As they navigate this critical phase of their lives, parents play a significant role in shaping their children's future. One of the most effective ways parents can prepare their teenage children for adult life is by encouraging them to take a part-time job. I firmly agree with this statement.Having a part-time job can teach teenagers valuable skills such as time management, responsibility, and teamwork. By juggling school and work, they learn to prioritize tasks, manage their time efficiently, and balance multiple responsibilities. These skills are essential for success in adulthood, where they will be expected to handle multiple tasks, meet deadlines, and work collaboratively with others. Moreover, having a part-time job allows teenagers to develop a sense of responsibility and accountability, as they learn to manage their finances, meet work commitments, and deal with the consequences of their actions.Furthermore, a part-time job can provide teenagers with an opportunity to gain work experience, build their confidence, and develop a sense of self-worth. By earning their own money, they can also learn the value of hard work and the importance of budgeting, saving, and spending wisely. This, in turn, can help them become more financially literate and independent, skills that are crucial for success in adulthood.In conclusion, encouraging teenagers to take a part-time job is an excellent way for parents to prepare them for adult life. By teaching them valuable skills, providing work experience, and promoting financial literacy, parents can set their children up for success in their future careers and personal lives. As such, I strongly believe that part-time jobs are an essential part of a teenager's transition to adulthood.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";"As a student, I have had the opportunity to study both alone and in a group setting. While both methods have their advantages, I personally prefer to study with a group of students. In my experience, studying in a group offers several benefits that outweigh those of solo studying.First and foremost, studying in a group promotes active learning and engagement. When working in a group, students are more likely to stay motivated and focused, as they can draw energy and encouragement from one another. For instance, during my group study sessions, we often take turns explaining complex concepts to each other, which helps to reinforce our understanding of the material and retain the information better.Another significant advantage of group studying is the diverse range of perspectives and ideas that it brings. When students from different backgrounds and with different learning styles come together, they can share their insights and approaches to problem-solving, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. In my own experience, group discussions have often led to ""aha"" moments, where a classmate's explanation or analogy has helped to clarify a concept that I had been struggling with.Additionally, group studying can be a great way to develop important life skills, such as teamwork, communication, and time management. By working together to achieve a common goal, students can learn to rely on each other's strengths and compensate for each other's weaknesses, much like they would in a real-world professional setting.While some students may prefer the quiet, solo environment, I find that the social and collaborative aspects of group studying make it a more enjoyable and effective way to learn. Overall, I believe that studying with a group of students is a more engaging, dynamic, and rewarding experience that ultimately leads to better academic outcomes."
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;When it comes to career preferences, people often find themselves at a crossroads, torn between the allure of being self-employed, working for someone else, or owning a business. As for me, I would rather own a business. This preference stems from a combination of factors that cater to my personal goals, values, and aspirations.Owning a business offers the ideal blend of autonomy and financial potential. Unlike being self-employed, where the focus is solely on personal work, owning a business allows for the creation of jobs and opportunities for others, contributing to the broader community. At the same time, it provides a level of independence and flexibility that working for someone else cannot match. As a business owner, I would have the freedom to make decisions, set goals, and direct the trajectory of my venture, which is a significant draw for me.Moreover, owning a business offers vast growth opportunities. It allows for scalability, diversification, and the possibility of creating a legacy. The financial rewards can also be substantial, providing a means to secure a better future for myself and my family. Another aspect that appeals to me is the ability to innovate and bring new ideas to the market. As a business owner, I would be in a position to conceptualize, develop, and implement novel products or services that can make a tangible impact on people's lives.In conclusion, owning a business offers the perfect blend of autonomy, potential for growth, and the opportunity to create something from the ground up. While there are risks associated with entrepreneurship, the rewards far outweigh them, making this path the most appealing to me.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";The preservation of historic buildings has become a pressing issue in urban development, as cities grapple with the need to modernize while maintaining their cultural heritage. In my opinion, cities should prioritize preserving their old, historic buildings rather than destroying them and replacing them with modern structures.Firstly, historic buildings serve as a tangible link to the past, providing a window into a city's history and cultural identity. The destruction of these buildings would erase a significant part of a city's character, making it indistinguishable from other cities. For instance, the preservation of ancient buildings in cities like Rome and Paris has enabled them to maintain their unique charm and attract millions of tourists each year.Secondly, preserving historic buildings can be economically beneficial. In many cases, historic buildings can be repurposed and renovated to serve modern needs, such as office spaces, restaurants, and museums. This not only saves the cost of demolition and rebuilding but also generates revenue and creates jobs. For example, the historic district of Savannah, Georgia, has been beautifully restored and now thrives as a popular tourist destination, supporting local businesses and contributing to the city's economy.Furthermore, preserving historic buildings can also promote sustainability. Rather than wasting resources on new construction, cities can choose to reuse and adapt existing buildings, reducing waste and minimizing the environmental impact of new construction. Additionally, many historic buildings were designed with natural ventilation and lighting in mind, making them more energy-efficient than modern buildings.In conclusion, while modern buildings may offer more space and efficiency, the benefits of preserving historic buildings far outweigh the advantages of replacing them. Cities should prioritize preserving their historic buildings to maintain their cultural identity, promote economic growth, and reduce their environmental footprint.
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;I disagree with the statement that parents are the best teachers. While parents play a significant role in a child's development, I believe that they are not necessarily the best teachers.On one hand, parents have a unique influence on their children's lives. They are the primary caregivers and role models, and as such, they have a profound impact on their children's values, beliefs, and behaviors. Many children learn important life skills, such as social etiquette, emotional intelligence, and responsibility, from their parents. Additionally, parents are often better equipped to understand their children's individual needs and learning styles, allowing them to provide tailored guidance and support.However, there are several reasons why parents may not be the best teachers. Firstly, parents may not possess the necessary expertise or qualifications to teach certain subjects or skills. For instance, a parent who is not proficient in mathematics may struggle to help their child with complex mathematical concepts. Secondly, parents may not have the objectivity or detachment to provide constructive feedback and criticism. A teacher, on the other hand, can offer a fresh perspective and provide feedback that is unbiased by personal relationships.Furthermore, formal education provides children with access to a wide range of subjects, topics, and teaching styles, which can cater to different learning needs and interests. A classroom setting also allows children to interact with peers, develop social skills, and learn from others' experiences and perspectives. In contrast, parents may not be able to provide the same level of diversity and breadth in their teaching.In conclusion, while parents play a vital role in their children's education, I do not believe that they are the best teachers. Formal education and teachers provide children with a comprehensive and well-rounded education that is essential for their future success.
323;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task.;"In my family, the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father's job. Five years ago, he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer, and became a landscape painter. Every time I asked him why, he will say, seriously,"" I am done, doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different, that is all."" While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job, but from my perspective, I am on the side of my father.Most of workers have adapted to do same task. It allows us to achieve more. As a authoritative dentist in my province, my mother has worked for 25 years. Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India, finally he became the father of the nation. These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time. While when it comes to ""happier"", different type of jobs can be responsible factor.Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier. Workers, who work for an ordinary company or industry, will be sick of same tasks day by day. Although they can be familiar with their job, changing of job is what serve to their happier. Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment, which, according to psychology theories, makes workers relaxed and happier. To set another example, consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work, employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits. They both will be happy because the change of job, not the same task day by day.Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges, making life colorful. Just like a song, if I did not have challenge, life would be blue. As an engineering researcher, I will surely be disappointed for failure, and exited for new challenges. New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works, it also means through dealing with it, I will obtain more knowledge and experience. As the saying of a Chinese writer, the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf, but rather there always exists new things and challenge. After all, doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden, connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life.To sum up, I admire my father's choice, while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert, like my mom, I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life.";The concept of job satisfaction has long been a topic of discussion among professionals and researchers alike. One notion that has gained significant attention is that workers would be much happier if they were doing different types of tasks during their workday rather than doing the same task. In my opinion, I wholeheartedly agree with this statement.First and foremost, doing different types of tasks during the workday can break the monotony of repetitive work, thereby increasing job satisfaction. When employees are tasked with a variety of responsibilities, they are constantly challenged and engaged, which can lead to a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. This, in turn, can boost their morale and motivation, leading to a happier and more productive work environment.Furthermore, performing multiple tasks can also provide opportunities for employees to develop new skills and expertise. By rotating tasks, employees can broaden their knowledge and experience, making them more versatile and valuable to their organization. This can lead to increased job satisfaction, as employees feel a sense of personal growth and development.Another advantage of doing different types of tasks is that it can reduce the risk of burnout. When employees perform the same task repeatedly, they can become bored, demotivated, and eventually, burnt out. By varying tasks, employees can avoid the mental and physical exhaustion associated with repetitive work, leading to a healthier and happier work-life balance.However, it's worth noting that some employees may thrive in repetitive work environments, as they may prefer routine and predictability. Nonetheless, for many workers, variety is indeed the spice of life, and doing different types of tasks during the workday can be a key driver of job satisfaction.In conclusion, I firmly believe that workers would be much happier if they were doing different types of tasks during their workday rather than doing the same task. By providing variety, challenge, and opportunities for growth, employers can create a more engaged, motivated, and productive workforce.
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;The ability to adapt to a new environment is crucial in succeeding in a new job. While having excellent knowledge of the job is undoubtedly important, I firmly believe that adaptability takes precedence. In today's fast-paced and ever-changing work environment, the ability to adjust to new situations, people, and technologies is vital for survival.Excellent knowledge of a job can only take one so far. Without the ability to adapt, an individual may struggle to navigate the nuances of a new work environment, leading to frustration and stagnation. Adaptability, on the other hand, enables one to quickly absorb new information, adjust to new workflows, and build relationships with colleagues. This flexibility allows individuals to learn from their mistakes, seek feedback, and continuously improve their performance.Moreover, adaptability is a transferable skill that can be applied across various roles and industries. It enables individuals to pivot when circumstances change, whether it's a shift in company priorities, a change in management, or an unexpected setback. In contrast, excellent knowledge of a job, while valuable, may become outdated or irrelevant in the face of rapid technological advancements or changes in market trends.In conclusion, while excellent knowledge of a job is essential, the ability to adapt to a new environment is more critical to success in a new job. Adaptability allows individuals to navigate the complexities of a new work environment, learn from their experiences, and continuously grow and improve. As the workplace continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, the ability to adapt will remain a vital skill for professionals seeking to thrive in their careers.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;The impact of computers on modern life is a topic of ongoing debate. While some people believe that computers have simplified life and increased convenience, others argue that they have introduced new complexities and stressors. In my opinion, I think that computers have made life both easier and more complex, depending on how they are used.On the one hand, computers have undoubtedly made life easier and more convenient in many ways. For example, online shopping has enabled people to purchase goods and services from the comfort of their own homes, saving time and effort. Additionally, computers have made it possible to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away, through email, social media, and video conferencing. Moreover, computers have automated many mundane tasks, such as banking and bill payments, freeing up time for more leisure activities.On the other hand, computers have also introduced new complexities and stressors into modern life. For instance, the constant stream of notifications and emails can be overwhelming and distracting, leading to feelings of anxiety and burnout. Furthermore, the rise of cyberbullying and online harassment has created new social problems that did not exist before. Moreover, the reliance on computers has also led to concerns about job security, as automation and artificial intelligence threaten to displace human workers.In conclusion, I believe that computers have both simplified and complicated life, depending on how they are used. While they have introduced many conveniences and efficiencies, they have also created new challenges and stressors. To maximize the benefits of computers, it is essential to use them wisely and in moderation, and to be mindful of the potential pitfalls and complexities they can introduce. By being aware of these issues, we can harness the power of computers to improve our lives, while minimizing their negative impacts.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;The debate on whether children should start learning a foreign language as soon as they start school has gained significant attention in recent years. While some argue that it's too early for children to begin learning a foreign language, I strongly believe that introducing foreign languages at a young age has numerous benefits. In this essay, I will present several reasons to support my position.Firstly, research has shown that young children have a unique ability to absorb and process languages quickly and easily. Children as young as three or four years old can pick up the sounds, rhythms, and grammar of a foreign language with remarkable speed. This is because their brains are wired to learn language, and they have not yet developed the self-consciousness that can hinder language learning in older children and adults.Secondly, learning a foreign language at a young age can greatly enhance a child's cognitive abilities. Studies have demonstrated that bilingual children tend to perform better in school, have better problem-solving skills, and are more creative than their monolingual peers. Additionally, learning a foreign language can also improve a child's understanding of their native language, as they are able to compare and contrast the two languages.Lastly, in today's increasingly globalized world, speaking multiple languages is becoming an essential skill for future careers and communication. By introducing foreign languages at a young age, children can develop a strong foundation in language learning and set themselves up for success in an interconnected world.In conclusion, I firmly believe that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. The benefits of early language learning are numerous, ranging from enhanced cognitive abilities to improved career prospects. By introducing foreign languages at a young age, we can give children the gift of language and set them up for success in an increasingly globalized world.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;The debate about whether boys and girls should attend separate schools has been ongoing for a long time. While some people believe that single-sex schools are beneficial for students, others argue that co-educational institutions are more advantageous. In my opinion, I disagree with the statement that boys and girls should attend separate schools.First and foremost, attending a co-educational school provides students with the opportunity to interact and learn from each other. Boys and girls can benefit from each other's perspectives and experiences, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the world. For instance, in a co-educational setting, boys can learn about the challenges faced by girls, such as sexism and inequality, and develop empathy towards them. Similarly, girls can learn from boys about their experiences and perspectives, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation.Another significant advantage of co-educational schools is that they prepare students for the real world. In the future, boys and girls will be working together, sharing ideas, and collaborating on projects. By attending separate schools, students may miss out on the opportunity to develop essential social skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Furthermore, co-educational schools promote mutual respect and understanding between the sexes, which is essential for building a harmonious and equal society.Finally, research has shown that co-educational schools do not have a significant impact on the academic performance of students. In fact, some studies suggest that girls perform better in co-educational settings, while boys perform better in single-sex schools. However, these differences are relatively small and do not outweigh the benefits of co-educational schools.In conclusion, while single-sex schools may have their advantages, I firmly believe that boys and girls should attend co-educational schools. By interacting and learning from each other, students can develop essential social skills, mutual respect, and a deeper understanding of the world.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";"The age-old debate about the origin of success has sparked intense discussions among individuals from diverse backgrounds. While some attribute success to taking risks, others believe it stems from meticulous planning. In my opinion, success is a product of a delicate balance between these two approaches.On one hand, taking calculated risks can indeed pave the way to success. History is replete with examples of visionaries who dared to challenge conventional norms and reaped the rewards of their boldness. Steve Jobs, for instance, took a huge risk by dropping out of college and pursuing his passion for technology, which eventually led to the creation of Apple. Similarly, entrepreneurs like Richard Branson and Elon Musk have built their empires by embracing risk and pushing the boundaries of innovation.On the other hand, careful planning is equally essential in achieving success. A well-thought-out strategy, coupled with meticulous execution, can help individuals navigate the challenges that come with pursuing their goals. For example, athletes like Michael Jordan and Serena Williams spent years honing their skills through rigorous training and planning, ultimately leading to their triumphs in their respective sports. Moreover, business leaders like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates attribute their success to their ability to plan and strategize, making informed decisions that have contributed to their remarkable achievements.In conclusion, success is not solely the result of either taking risks or careful planning. Rather, it is the synergy between these two approaches that leads to achieving one's goals. By embracing calculated risks and combining them with a well-planned strategy, individuals can position themselves for success. As the renowned entrepreneur, Gary Vaynerchuk, aptly puts it, ""The biggest risk is not taking any risk..."""
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";While it may seem counterintuitive to engage in activities that do not bring us joy, I firmly believe that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. This notion may seem restrictive, but it can ultimately lead to personal growth, skill development, and a stronger sense of responsibility.One primary reason is that some tasks, though unpleasant, are necessary for our survival and well-being. For instance, many people dislike doing household chores or paying bills, but these tasks are crucial for maintaining a clean and comfortable living environment. By completing these tasks, individuals can ensure their health and financial security, even if they do not derive enjoyment from them.Another reason is that doing things we do not enjoy can help us develop valuable skills and build character. For example, a student may not enjoy public speaking, but by participating in presentations and debates, they can improve their communication skills and become more confident in expressing themselves. Similarly, an athlete may not enjoy the grueling training sessions, but the hard work and dedication can lead to improved physical fitness and mental toughness.Additionally, doing things we do not enjoy can also teach us the value of perseverance and responsibility. By pushing through unpleasant tasks, individuals can develop a strong work ethic and learn to prioritize tasks based on their importance rather than their enjoyment factor. This mindset can benefit many areas of life, from academics to career development.In conclusion, while it may seem unappealing to engage in activities that do not bring us joy, it is essential to recognize the value of doing things we do not enjoy. By doing so, we can develop valuable skills, build character, and cultivate a sense of responsibility, ultimately leading to personal growth and a more fulfilling life.
330;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homesÊ;The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance. Therefore, government should spend money on preservation of old buildings.;As the world continues to urbanize and modernize, the importance of preserving historic or traditional buildings and homes has sparked intense debate. While some argue that it is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings, I firmly disagree. Preserving historic and traditional structures is crucial for maintaining cultural heritage, promoting tourism, and fostering a sense of community.Firstly, historic buildings and homes are tangible links to our past, providing a glimpse into the lives of our ancestors and the events that shaped our nation. By preserving these structures, we can learn from our history, appreciate the craftsmanship of previous generations, and gain a deeper understanding of our cultural identity. In contrast, new buildings, no matter how modern or sleek, lack the character and significance of their historic counterparts.Secondly, preserving historic buildings can be a significant economic boost, particularly in the tourism sector. Many travelers are drawn to historic sites and landmarks, which can generate substantial revenue for local businesses and communities. For instance, cities like Paris and Rome, famous for their well-preserved historic architecture, attract millions of visitors each year, supporting local economies and promoting cultural exchange.Lastly, preserving traditional buildings and homes can help to create a sense of community and belonging. These structures often reflect the unique characteristics of a region or neighborhood, fostering a sense of pride and identity among residents. In contrast, new buildings can be impersonal and lack the warmth and character of traditional architecture.In conclusion, while building new infrastructure is essential for a country's development, I firmly believe that preserving historic and traditional buildings and homes should take precedence. These structures are not only a vital part of our cultural heritage but also play a significant role in promoting tourism, fostering community, and shaping our national identity.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;When it comes to young adults, there is a common debate on whether it is better to gain independence from parents as soon as possible or live with family for a longer period. In my opinion, gaining independence from parents is a more beneficial option for young adults. This solution has several advantages that outweigh the benefits of living with family.Firstly, living independently helps young adults develop important life skills such as cooking, cleaning, and managing finances. These skills are essential for a person to become self-sufficient and responsible. For instance, when I moved to a university dorm, I had to learn how to cook and manage my expenses, which helped me become more responsible and confident.Secondly, independence from parents allows young adults to make their own decisions and learn from their own mistakes. This freedom enables them to explore their interests, make choices, and take risks without the fear of parental disapproval. For example, a friend of mine who moved out of his parents' house at the age of 20 was able to pursue his passion for music without his parents' disapproval. He is now a successful musician.In contrast, living with family for a longer period can hinder a young adult's personal growth and development. Over-reliance on parents can create a sense of dependency, which can be detrimental to their future. Moreover, living with family can limit a young adult's freedom and autonomy, preventing them from exploring their full potential.In conclusion, gaining independence from parents is a better solution for young adults. It allows them to develop important life skills, make their own decisions, and explore their interests. While living with family can provide financial support and emotional comfort, the benefits of independence far outweigh these advantages.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way people interact with each other, significantly impacting the types of relationships they form. On one hand, technology has made it easier for people to connect with others across geographical boundaries, fostering global relationships and communities. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools have enabled people to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away, and to meet new people who share similar interests.However, technology has also led to the rise of superficial relationships. Social media platforms, in particular, have created a culture of curated profiles and shallow interactions, where people present a highlight reel of their lives, hiding their true selves. This has led to a lack of depth and intimacy in relationships, as people substitute online interactions for meaningful, face-to-face connections.Moreover, technology has also contributed to the erosion of attention span and the ability to engage in meaningful conversations. The constant stream of notifications, emails, and messages can be overwhelming, leading to a state of continuous distraction, where people struggle to focus on one conversation or interaction at a time.Despite these drawbacks, technology has also enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests and passions, creating online communities around shared hobbies and causes. This has been particularly beneficial for people who are isolated or marginalized, providing them with a sense of belonging and connection.In conclusion, while technology has undoubtedly changed the way people interact with each other, its impact on relationships is multifaceted. While it has opened up new avenues for connection and community-building, it has also contributed to the rise of superficial relationships and the erosion of attention span. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to harness technology in a way that fosters meaningful connections and relationships, rather than allowing it to dictate the quality of their interactions.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The rapid advancement and integration of new technology in various sectors have led to the automation of numerous tasks, previously performed by humans. This trend has both positive and negative implications, which will be discussed in this essay.On the one hand, the increasing use of machines to perform tasks has several advantages. Firstly, it boosts efficiency and productivity, as machines can operate around the clock without breaks, resulting in faster completion of tasks and higher output. Additionally, automation reduces the risk of human error, as machines are programmed to perform tasks with precision and accuracy. This is particularly significant in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and finance, where mistakes can have severe consequences.Another advantage of this trend is that it enables the reallocation of human resources to more complex and creative tasks that require problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and innovation. By automating routine and repetitive tasks, humans are freed to focus on high-value tasks that drive innovation and growth.On the other hand, there are also significant disadvantages to this trend. One of the most notable concerns is the potential loss of jobs, as machines and automation replace human workers. This can lead to unemployment, particularly among low-skilled and low-educated workers who are most vulnerable to automation. Furthermore, the increasing reliance on machines and automation can also lead to a loss of traditional skills and craftsmanship, as well as a diminished sense of human agency and control.In conclusion, while the increasing use of machines to perform tasks has numerous advantages, such as increased efficiency and productivity, it also has significant disadvantages, including job displacement and loss of traditional skills.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;The rapid advancement of information technology (IT) over the past 20 years has revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. The World Wide Web and email have transformed the global landscape, facilitating instant access to information and connecting people worldwide. However, there is a growing concern that future developments in IT may have more negative effects than positive. In my opinion, while there are potential downsides, the benefits of future IT advancements are likely to outweigh the drawbacks.On one hand, it is true that increased reliance on IT can lead to negative consequences, such as job displacement, social isolation, and cyber threats. The automation of jobs, for instance, may exacerbate unemployment and widen the wealth gap. Moreover, excessive screen time and social media usage can contribute to decreased face-to-face interactions and deepened social divisions. Furthermore, the proliferation of connected devices and networks has created new vulnerabilities to cyber attacks and data breaches, compromising personal and national security.On the other hand, I firmly believe that future IT developments will bring about numerous benefits that will outweigh the negatives. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) hold immense potential for improving healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools can enhance disease detection and treatment, while IoT sensors can monitor and mitigate climate change. Additionally, IT can bridge geographical gaps, providing equal access to education and economic opportunities for marginalized communities.In conclusion, while acknowledging the potential risks and challenges associated with future IT developments, I believe that the benefits will ultimately prevail. By harnessing the power of technology and addressing the negative consequences proactively, we can ensure that the next 20 years of IT advancements usher in a brighter, more equitable, and more connected future for all.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;The influence of media coverage on celebrities and its impact on children is a topic of increasing concern in today's society. While some people believe that this coverage has a negative effect on children, I agree with this opinion to a great extent.On one hand, excessive media coverage of celebrities can lead to the idolization of these figures, resulting in children emulating their behavior, values, and lifestyle choices. Children may develop unrealistic expectations and aspirations, as they are often presented with glamorous and unattainable images of celebrities. This can lead to low self-esteem, as they compare their own lives to the seemingly perfect ones of celebrities. Furthermore, the constant bombardment of celebrity gossip and scandals can desensitize children to the consequences of bad behavior, making them more likely to engage in similar behavior.On the other hand, it is also possible that media coverage of celebrities can have positive effects on children. For instance, celebrities can serve as role models, promoting good values and behavior. Some celebrities use their platform to raise awareness for social causes, inspiring children to become involved in philanthropy and activism. However, these positive effects are often overshadowed by the overwhelming amount of negative coverage.In conclusion, I believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a predominantly negative effect on children. Parents and guardians should be aware of the media their children are consuming and take steps to mitigate its influence. By promoting critical thinking and media literacy, we can help children navigate the complexities of celebrity culture and develop a more balanced view of the world. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to ensure that children are protected from the potential harm of excessive celebrity media coverage.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way people communicate, raising concerns about the impact of technology on social interaction. While some argue that mobile phones destroy social interaction, I disagree. In my opinion, mobile phones have transformed the way people interact, but not necessarily destroyed it.On the one hand, mobile phones have made it easier for people to stay connected with others, regardless of geographical distance. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools have enabled people to maintain relationships and communicate with others across the globe. This has been particularly beneficial for people who have difficulty meeting in person, such as those with mobility issues or living in remote areas.On the other hand, some argue that excessive mobile phone use can lead to social isolation and decreased face-to-face interaction. However, this is not a result of the technology itself, but rather a result of how individuals choose to use it. Mobile phones are simply a tool, and like any tool, they can be used for good or ill. People who spend too much time on their phones may indeed experience social isolation, but this is a matter of personal choice and self-regulation, rather than a inherent flaw of the technology.Moreover, mobile phones have also enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests and passions, through online communities and forums. This has opened up new opportunities for social interaction and collaboration, which may not have been possible without the technology.In conclusion, while mobile phones have certainly changed the way people interact, I do not believe they have destroyed social interaction. Instead, they have provided new avenues for connection and communication, which can be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on how they are used. As with any technology, it is up to individuals to use mobile phones in a way that enhances, rather than hinders, their social relationships.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;The advent of modern communication technologies, such as email and messaging apps, has revolutionized the way people connect with each other. However, it has also been argued that these innovations have led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, negatively impacting social lives. While there is some truth to this claim, I believe that the relationship between modern communication and social lives is more complex than a simple cause-and-effect scenario.On the one hand, it is undeniable that modern communication technologies have made it easier for people to stay in touch with friends and family without having to physically meet. Email, messaging apps, and social media have reduced the need for in-person interactions, potentially leading to a decline in face-to-face socializing. This can have negative consequences, such as increased feelings of loneliness and isolation, as well as decreased empathy and deepened relationships.On the other hand, modern communication technologies have also enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests and passions, regardless of geographical distance. Social media platforms, online forums, and messaging groups have made it possible for people to expand their social circles and engage in meaningful interactions with others who may not have been accessible through traditional face-to-face interactions.Furthermore, modern communication technologies have also facilitated the organization of in-person meetups and events, allowing people to plan and coordinate social activities with ease. This has enabled people to balance their online interactions with face-to-face socializing, potentially offsetting the negative effects of reduced in-person interactions.In conclusion, while modern communication technologies may have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends, I do not entirely agree that this has had a negative effect on their social lives. The impact of modern communication on social lives is complex and multifaceted, and it is up to individuals to strike a balance between online interactions and face-to-face socializing.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";The debate surrounding the role of competition in childhood development has sparked intense discussion among educators and parents. While some argue that fostering a sense of competition in children is essential for their growth, others believe that teaching cooperation yields more useful adults. In this essay, we will examine both perspectives and argue that cooperation is the more beneficial approach.Proponents of competition argue that it drives children to strive for excellence, pushing them to work harder and achieve more. This, in turn, prepares them for the competitive nature of the real world. However, this approach can lead to an overemphasis on individual success, often at the expense of others. Children who are constantly pitted against each other may develop a cutthroat mentality, prioritizing their own achievements over the well-being of their peers.On the other hand, teaching children to cooperate rather than compete has numerous benefits. When children work together towards a common goal, they develop essential skills such as communication, problem-solving, and empathy. These skills are invaluable in the workplace, where collaboration and teamwork are increasingly important. Moreover, cooperative learning environments promote a sense of community and social responsibility, encouraging children to consider the needs of others and work towards the greater good.Furthermore, an overemphasis on competition can lead to negative consequences such as stress, anxiety, and decreased self-esteem. Children who are constantly competing may feel pressured to perform, leading to a fear of failure and a lack of creativity. In contrast, cooperative learning environments foster a sense of mutual support and encouragement, allowing children to take risks and explore their interests without fear of judgment.In conclusion, while competition can drive children to achieve more, the benefits of cooperation far outweigh those of competition. By teaching children to work together and prioritize the needs of others, we can raise more empathetic, creative, and socially responsible adults.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;The advent of technology has undoubtedly transformed the way people interact with each other, leading to a significant shift in the types of relationships formed. Social media platforms, instant messaging apps, and online communities have made it easier for individuals to connect with others across geographical boundaries. However, this has also led to a decline in face-to-face interactions and deep, meaningful relationships.On the one hand, technology has enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests, passions, and values. Online forums, social media groups, and specialized communities have created spaces for people to engage in discussions, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. This has led to the formation of new relationships that transcend geographical and cultural barriers. Moreover, technology has also facilitated communication with distant friends and family members, helping to maintain relationships that might have otherwise been lost due to physical distance.On the other hand, excessive reliance on technology has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, which are essential for building strong, empathetic relationships. People are increasingly substituting digital communication for in-person interactions, leading to a lack of depth and intimacy in relationships. Moreover, the curated and superficial nature of social media platforms can create unrealistic expectations and promote competition, rather than genuine connections. Cyberbullying, online harassment, and social isolation are also growing concerns that highlight the negative aspects of technology's impact on relationships.In conclusion, while technology has opened up new avenues for forming relationships, it is crucial to maintain a balance between online interactions and in-person connections. By acknowledging the limitations and pitfalls of technology-mediated relationships, we can harness its potential to augment and enhance our social connections, rather than replace them. Ultimately, the key to positive relationships in the digital age lies in striking a balance between technology and face-to-face interaction.
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;The relentless march of technological advancements has undeniably transformed the fabric of modern society. As countries continue to develop their technology, concerns have been raised about the erosion of traditional skills and ways of life. While some argue that it is pointless to try and keep these traditions alive, I firmly believe that this opinion is overstated.On one hand, technological progress has indeed led to the decline of certain traditional skills and ways of life. The rise of automation, for instance, has replaced many manual labor jobs, rendering some traditional skills obsolete. Similarly, the proliferation of digital media has diminished the need for traditional craftsmanship, such as woodworking or weaving. In these cases, it is indeed challenging to justify the preservation of these skills.On the other hand, traditional skills and ways of life possess intrinsic value that transcends their practical applications. They embody a nation's cultural heritage, history, and identity. By preserving these traditions, we can maintain a vital connection to our past, fostering a sense of continuity and shared experience. Moreover, many traditional skills and crafts are being rediscovered and reappreciated for their unique aesthetic and artisanal qualities.Furthermore, preserving traditional skills and ways of life can also contribute to sustainable development. For example, traditional farming practices, though labor-intensive, can promote biodiversity, soil conservation, and ecological balance. By embracing these traditional methods, we can mitigate the environmental costs of technological progress.In conclusion, while technological advancements may render some traditional skills and ways of life obsolete, it is far from pointless to try and keep them alive. By preserving and appreciating these traditions, we can safeguard our cultural heritage, promote sustainable development, and maintain a vital connection to our collective past.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;The debate on whether children should be encouraged to compete or cooperate has sparked intense discussion among parents, educators, and experts. Some argue that fostering a sense of competition in children is beneficial, while others believe that teaching them to cooperate is more valuable. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my opinion on the matter.On the one hand, encouraging competition in children can have several benefits. It can drive them to strive for excellence, push beyond their limits, and develop a strong work ethic. Competition can also prepare them for the realities of the adult world, where they will face numerous challenges and rivals. Moreover, competitions can provide children with opportunities to develop essential skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making. For instance, participating in quizzes, sports, or debate competitions can help children build confidence, learn from failures, and develop resilience.On the other hand, some argue that promoting cooperation over competition is more beneficial for children. By teaching children to work together towards a common goal, they can develop essential life skills such as teamwork, empathy, and communication. Cooperation can also foster a sense of community, social responsibility, and mutual respect among children. Moreover, in a cooperative environment, children can feel more comfortable taking risks, sharing ideas, and learning from one another. For example, group projects or volunteer work can help children develop a sense of social responsibility and understand the value of collective effort.In my opinion, a balance between competition and cooperation is essential. While competition can drive children to achieve excellence, it can also lead to stress, anxiety, and an overemphasis on individual success. On the other hand, cooperation can foster a sense of community and social responsibility, but may not provide the same level of motivation and drive. Ultimately, children should be encouraged to compete in a healthy and constructive manner, while also being taught the value of cooperation and teamwork. By striking a balance between these two approaches, we can raise children who are not only driven to succeed but also equipped with the essential life skills to thrive in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;The impact of advertising on society has long been a topic of debate. While some people believe that advertising causes more harm than good, others argue that it has numerous benefits. In this essay, we will discuss both perspectives and provide an opinion on the matter.On the one hand, those who think that advertising does more harm than good point out that it can be deceptive and manipulative. Many advertisements make false or exaggerated claims about products, which can lead to consumer disappointment and mistrust. Furthermore, advertising can also perpetuate unrealistic beauty standards, materialism, and unhealthy lifestyles. For instance, the constant bombardment of images of perfect bodies in beauty and fashion ads can lead to body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem among young people.On the other hand, others argue that advertising has numerous benefits for society. Advertising can inform consumers about new products and services, which can improve their lives and increase their choices. It can also support businesses and create jobs, as companies rely on advertising to reach their target audience and increase sales. Moreover, advertising can also promote social causes and raise awareness about important issues, such as health and environmental concerns.In my opinion, while advertising can have negative consequences, its benefits outweigh its drawbacks. Advertising is an inevitable part of modern life, and it is up to consumers to be critical and discerning about the information they receive. Moreover, many companies are now using advertising to promote positive social and environmental causes, which can have a positive impact on society.In conclusion, the impact of advertising on society is complex and multifaceted. While it can have negative consequences, its benefits for businesses, consumers, and society as a whole are significant. By promoting responsible advertising practices and media literacy, we can minimize the harms of advertising and maximize its benefits.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";The art world has always been plagued by inequality, with some artists reaping enormous financial rewards while others struggle to make ends meet. The question of whether the government should intervene to resolve this issue is a contentious one. While I agree that the situation is unfair, I believe that government intervention is not the most effective solution.On one hand, the government could provide financial support to struggling artists, such as grants, subsidies, or tax breaks. This could help to level the playing field and give more artists a chance to succeed. Additionally, the government could establish programs to promote and showcase the work of lesser-known artists, increasing their visibility and opportunities.On the other hand, government intervention in the art market can be problematic. Art is inherently subjective, and it is difficult for the government to determine which artists are worthy of support. Furthermore, government funding can lead to a homogenization of artistic styles, as artists may feel pressured to create work that is more likely to receive funding. This could stifle innovation and creativity, ultimately doing more harm than good.Instead of government intervention, I believe that the art market should be allowed to self-regulate. Private organizations, such as galleries and museums, can provide support and exposure to struggling artists. Additionally, the rise of online platforms has democratized the art world, allowing artists to showcase their work and connect with potential buyers directly. While this may not completely eradicate the inequality, it can help to create a more level playing field.In conclusion, while the current state of the art world is undoubtedly unfair, I believe that government intervention is not the solution. Instead, the art market should be allowed to self-regulate, with private organizations and online platforms providing support and opportunities to struggling artists.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";The phenomenon of working long hours has become increasingly prevalent in today's fast-paced world. While some argue that longer working hours are essential for productivity and career advancement, I firmly believe that working hours should be restricted to mitigate the detrimental effects on individuals, their families, and society as a whole.Prolonged working hours take a toll on one's physical and mental health. Research has shown that working excessive hours can lead to increased stress levels, cardiovascular diseases, and even depression. Furthermore, the strain of long working hours can also affect interpersonal relationships, causing conflicts and emotional distance within families. For instance, parents who work long hours may miss out on quality time with their children, hindering their emotional and psychological development.Moreover, long working hours can have far-reaching consequences for society. When individuals work excessively, they have less time to engage in community activities, volunteer, or participate in hobbies that foster social connections and a sense of belonging. This, in turn, can lead to social isolation, decreased civic engagement, and a decline in community cohesion. Moreover, long working hours can also perpetuate a culture of overwork and burnout, where individuals feel pressured to prioritize work over personal well-being.Restricting working hours can help alleviate these issues. By implementing policies such as flexible work arrangements, job sharing, or a standard 35-hour workweek, governments and employers can promote a healthier work-life balance. This, in turn, can lead to improved productivity, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. Additionally, restricted working hours can also enable individuals to pursue other interests, nurture relationships, and contribute to their communities, ultimately fostering a more harmonious and equitable society.In conclusion, I strongly agree that working hours should be restricted to mitigate the negative effects on individuals, their families, and society. By promoting a healthier work-life balance, we can create a more sustainable, equitable, and thriving society that values human well-being alongside productivity and economic growth.
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;I disagree with the statement that a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. While financial success is often seen as a hallmark of achievement, it is by no means the only measure of a person's success.First and foremost, success is a highly subjective concept that varies greatly from person to person. For some, success may mean achieving a certain level of professional recognition or exceling in their chosen field. For others, it may mean building strong relationships, pursuing their passions, or making a positive impact on their community. Money, in and of itself, is not a reliable indicator of success.Furthermore, there are countless examples of individuals who have achieved great success without accumulating wealth. For instance, a dedicated teacher who has inspired countless students, a artist who has created a body of work that has touched the hearts of many, or a volunteer who has selflessly given their time and energy to a worthy cause. These individuals may not have earned a lot of money, but they have made a significant impact on the world around them.Additionally, an overemphasis on financial success can lead to an unbalanced and unsatisfying life. Research has shown that once basic needs are met, additional wealth does not necessarily lead to greater happiness or fulfillment. In fact, an excessive focus on material wealth can lead to stress, anxiety, and a sense of emptiness.In conclusion, while earning a lot of money may be one aspect of success, it is by no means the only measure of a person's achievement. Success is a multifaceted concept that encompasses a range of factors, including personal fulfillment, positive impact, and a sense of purpose. Ultimately, a successful person is one who has cultivated a rich and meaningful life, regardless of their financial status.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;The notion that the high sales of popular consumer goods are a reflection of the power of advertising, rather than the real needs of society, is a contentious issue. While advertising undoubtedly plays a significant role in shaping consumer preferences, I argue that this statement holds some truth but is not entirely accurate.On one hand, it is undeniable that advertising has a profound impact on consumer behavior. Advertisements often create perceived needs, fostering a desire for products that may not be essential. The constant bombardment of appealing images and persuasive messages can influence people to prioritize wants over actual necessities. Moreover, the proliferation of social media has enabled advertisers to target specific demographics, further amplifying their reach and influence. As a result, many consumer goods achieve high sales figures, not necessarily due to their inherent value or utility, but because of the effective marketing strategies employed.On the other hand, it is overly simplistic to attribute the sales of popular consumer goods solely to the power of advertising. Many products do fulfill real needs or offer genuine benefits, such as convenience, durability, or innovation. For instance, the sales of smartphones are largely driven by their ability to simplify communication, access information, and facilitate various tasks. In this case, the high sales figures can be attributed to the product's inherent value, rather than solely to advertising.Furthermore, consumers are not passive recipients of advertising messages. They exercise agency and make informed decisions based on their needs, preferences, and budget constraints. While advertising can influence purchasing decisions, it is not the sole determining factor.In conclusion, while advertising is a significant factor in shaping consumer behavior, it is not the sole driver of high sales figures. Real needs, product value, and consumer agency also play important roles. Therefore, I partially agree with the statement, acknowledging the power of advertising, but also recognizing the complexity of consumer behavior and the multifaceted factors that influence purchasing decisions.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;The notion that paying taxes is a sufficient contribution to society is a topic of debate. While taxes play a crucial role in supporting public services and infrastructure, I disagree with the idea that it is enough.On one hand, paying taxes is indeed a fundamental civic duty, and it is essential for the smooth functioning of a country. Taxes fund essential public services such as education, healthcare, and defense, which are vital for the well-being and security of citizens. In this sense, paying taxes can be seen as a contribution to the collective good. Furthermore, taxes also help to redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality, as they are typically progressive, with higher earners paying a greater proportion of their income in taxes.On the other hand, paying taxes is only one aspect of contributing to society. There are many other ways to make a positive impact, such as volunteering, donating to charity, and participating in community activities. These actions demonstrate a sense of social responsibility and can have a more direct and tangible impact on people's lives. For instance, volunteering at a local soup kitchen or helping at a community clean-up event can bring people together and foster a sense of community, which is essential for building a cohesive society.Moreover, relying solely on taxes to contribute to society can lead to a lack of personal engagement and a sense of disconnection from the community. When people only pay taxes, they may not feel invested in the community or take an active interest in its development. This can result in a lack of social cohesion and a diminished sense of civic responsibility.In conclusion, while paying taxes is a necessary contribution to society, it is not enough. Citizens should strive to contribute in multiple ways, including volunteering, donating, and participating in community activities. By doing so, they can demonstrate a deeper sense of social responsibility and help build a more cohesive and compassionate society.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";I disagree with the notion that school should only focus on teaching children academic subjects closely related to their future careers, while neglecting other subjects like music and sports. While it is true that subjects like mathematics, science, and technology are crucial for many careers, a well-rounded education should encompass a broader range of subjects.Firstly, music and sports are essential for the development of children's cognitive and physical abilities. Research has shown that learning a musical instrument can improve memory, concentration, and spatial-temporal skills, which are beneficial for problem-solving and critical thinking. Similarly, sports and physical education can enhance physical health, coordination, and teamwork skills, which are valuable in many areas of life.Secondly, a narrow focus on career-oriented subjects can lead to a lack of creativity and innovation. Music and arts, in particular, foster creativity, self-expression, and imagination, which are essential skills for many careers, including those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). By neglecting these subjects, schools may be depriving students of the opportunity to develop their creative potential.Thirdly, a balanced curriculum can help students discover their passions and interests, which may not be limited to traditional academic subjects. Many students may find that their strengths and talents lie in music, sports, or other extracurricular activities, which can lead to a more fulfilling and successful career.In conclusion, while it is important for schools to teach academic subjects relevant to future careers, it is equally important to provide a well-rounded education that includes music, sports, and other subjects. By doing so, schools can foster the development of cognitive, physical, and creative abilities, which are essential for success in all areas of life.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way we consume information, leading some to believe that the era of newspapers and magazines is coming to an end. While I understand the reasoning behind this notion, I do not entirely agree with it.On one hand, it is undeniable that the internet has made a vast array of information readily available at our fingertips. With just a few clicks, we can access news from around the world, read in-depth articles, and stay up-to-date on current events. This has undoubtedly led to a decline in newspaper and magazine sales, as many people are now turning to online sources for their news and information.However, I believe that newspapers and magazines still have a unique value proposition that cannot be replicated online. For one, they offer a curated selection of articles and stories, carefully chosen and edited by professionals to provide a comprehensive and balanced view of the world. In contrast, online sources can often be overwhelming, with a multitude of conflicting opinions and unverified information. Additionally, newspapers and magazines often provide a tangible, tactile experience that many people still enjoy, such as flipping through the pages, reading in a physical space, and sharing with others.Furthermore, many newspapers and magazines are adapting to the digital age by incorporating online content and social media into their offerings. This allows them to reach a wider audience, engage with readers, and provide a multi-platform experience that complements their print editions.In conclusion, while the internet has certainly disrupted the traditional newspaper and magazine industry, I do not believe that it will lead to their demise. Instead, I think that these publications will evolve and adapt to the changing media landscape, offering a unique blend of curated content, tactile experience, and online engagement that will continue to attract readers.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;When it comes to choosing a job, there are various factors that come into play. While salary is undoubtedly a crucial consideration, I disagree with the notion that it is the most important one. In my opinion, there are several other factors that play a significant role in determining job satisfaction and overall well-being.First and foremost, personal fulfillment and happiness are essential aspects of a job. A job that aligns with one's passion and values can bring a sense of purpose and motivation, which is hard to put a price tag on. For instance, a teacher may not earn as much as a corporate executive, but the sense of fulfillment they derive from shaping young minds is invaluable. Similarly, a job that offers a healthy work-life balance, opportunities for growth and development, and a supportive work environment can greatly impact an individual's overall quality of life.Furthermore, job security and stability are also vital considerations. A job with a stable income, benefits, and a clear career path can provide peace of mind and reduce stress. In contrast, a high-paying job with an uncertain future can lead to anxiety and insecurity.That being said, salary is still an important consideration, particularly in today's economy. A decent salary can provide financial stability, freedom, and opportunities for personal and professional growth. However, it is not the only consideration, and individuals should weigh their priorities carefully when choosing a job.In conclusion, while salary is an important factor in choosing a job, it is not the most important one. Personal fulfillment, job security, and overall well-being are equally, if not more, important considerations. Ultimately, the ideal job is one that strikes a balance between financial rewards and personal satisfaction.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;The widespread use of computers among children has sparked intense debate about its effects on their development. While computers offer numerous benefits, I firmly believe that using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children.On the one hand, computers provide children with a wealth of information and educational resources. They can access a vast array of learning materials, including e-books, educational games, and online tutorials, which can supplement their classroom learning. Additionally, computers can help children develop essential skills such as typing, coding, and problem-solving, which are crucial in today's digital age.However, excessive computer use can have serious negative consequences. For instance, prolonged screen time can lead to a range of health problems, including obesity, eye strain, and sleep deprivation. Moreover, computers can be a significant distraction, hindering children's ability to focus and engage in physical activities and social interactions. Social isolation, cyberbullying, and exposure to inappropriate content are also concerns that arise from excessive computer use.Furthermore, research suggests that excessive computer use can affect children's cognitive and emotional development. It can lead to a decline in attention span, creativity, and critical thinking skills. Children who spend too much time on computers may also experience increased stress and anxiety levels, which can negatively impact their mental health.In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool for children's education and development, excessive use can have severe negative consequences. It is essential for parents and caregivers to monitor and limit children's computer use, encouraging a balance between screen time and other aspects of their lives. By doing so, we can ensure that children reap the benefits of computers while minimizing the negative effects.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;The relationship between a child's upbringing and their ability to navigate the challenges of adulthood is a topic of ongoing debate. While some argue that children from low-income families are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life, others believe that this notion is overly simplistic and does not take into account the many factors that influence an individual's ability to cope with adversity.On the one hand, children from low-income families may develop certain skills and traits that are beneficial in dealing with the challenges of adulthood. For example, they may learn to be more resourceful, to budget and manage finances effectively, and to appreciate the value of hard work and perseverance. These skills can be invaluable in navigating the ups and downs of adult life, where unexpected expenses, job losses, and other setbacks can occur at any time.On the other hand, children from wealthy families may have access to more opportunities and resources that can also prepare them well for adult life. For example, they may have access to better education, healthcare, and social connections that can provide them with a strong foundation for success. Additionally, children from wealthy families may also learn important skills such as leadership, entrepreneurship, and financial management, which can be beneficial in their future careers.In conclusion, while there may be some truth to the idea that children from low-income families are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life, it is not necessarily a universal truth. Ultimately, a child's ability to navigate the challenges of adulthood depends on a complex array of factors, including their individual personality, skills, and experiences, as well as the values and support they receive from their family and community.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;The notion that a sedentary lifestyle is a significant contributor to the plethora of medical problems experienced by people in today's world is a notion that I strongly agree with. In contemporary society, technological advancements have led to a drastic reduction in physical activity, as many tasks can now be performed with minimal exertion.Research has consistently shown that a sedentary lifestyle is a major risk factor for numerous health problems, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer. For instance, prolonged periods of sitting have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, as it can lead to a reduction in insulin sensitivity, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol levels.Furthermore, a sedentary lifestyle can also have a profound impact on mental health, with studies indicating a correlation between physical inactivity and depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline. The World Health Organization recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, yet many individuals fail to meet these guidelines.However, it is essential to acknowledge that certain individuals may face barriers that prevent them from engaging in regular physical activity, such as those with disabilities or those living in areas with limited access to green spaces or recreational facilities.In conclusion, I firmly believe that a sedentary lifestyle is a significant contributor to many of the medical problems experienced by people in today's world. By incorporating regular physical activity into our daily routines and addressing the barriers that prevent certain individuals from doing so, we can mitigate the risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle and promote overall health and wellbeing.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";The idea of introducing foreign language instruction in kindergarten has gained significant attention in recent years. While some argue that it is too early for young children to learn a foreign language, I firmly believe that it is beneficial to start foreign language instruction in kindergarten.Firstly, research has shown that children as young as five or six years old have an incredible ability to absorb and learn languages quickly. Their brains are wired to learn and absorb new information, making it the perfect time to introduce them to a foreign language. In fact, studies have shown that children who learn a foreign language at a young age are more likely to achieve fluency and develop a native-like accent.Secondly, introducing foreign language instruction in kindergarten can have a significant impact on a child's cognitive and social development. Learning a foreign language can improve memory, concentration, and problem-solving skills, as well as enhance cultural awareness and understanding. Moreover, it can also foster a sense of curiosity and openness to new experiences, essential for young children to develop into well-rounded and empathetic individuals.Furthermore, starting foreign language instruction early on can also provide a competitive edge in today's globalized world. In an increasingly interconnected world, speaking multiple languages is becoming an essential skill, and those who start learning early on will have a significant advantage in the job market and beyond.In conclusion, I strongly agree that foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. The benefits of introducing a foreign language at a young age are numerous, from improved cognitive and social development to increased competitiveness in the global market. By starting early, we can provide children with the tools they need to succeed in an increasingly interconnected world.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;The rapid growth of international tourism has become a significant aspect of the global economy, generating substantial revenue for many countries. However, this phenomenon also raises concerns about the negative impacts it has on local cultures, environments, and societies. In my opinion, while international tourism has its benefits, the problems it causes indeed outweigh its advantages.On the one hand, international tourism can bring numerous economic benefits to host countries, including job creation, infrastructure development, and increased foreign exchange earnings. Additionally, tourism can also promote cultural understanding and exchange between nations, fostering global unity and cooperation. For instance, cultural festivals and events that attract international tourists can help preserve traditional practices and showcase a country's rich heritage.On the other hand, the problems caused by international tourism are more pronounced and far-reaching. The influx of tourists can lead to environmental degradation, such as pollution, over-tourism, and destruction of natural habitats. The strain on local resources, including water and energy, can also result in increased costs and scarcity for residents. Moreover, the commercialization of tourism can lead to the exploitation of local cultures, with traditional practices and customs being reduced to mere commodities for the sake of entertainment.Furthermore, the economic benefits of tourism are often unevenly distributed, with large corporations and tour operators reaping most of the profits, while local communities receive minimal benefits. In some cases, tourism has even led to the displacement of local residents, as their homes and communities are transformed into tourist accommodations.In conclusion, while international tourism has its economic and cultural benefits, the problems it causes, including environmental degradation, cultural exploitation, and economic inequality, outweigh its advantages. It is essential for governments and the tourism industry to adopt sustainable and responsible practices to mitigate these negative impacts and ensure that the benefits of tourism are shared equitably among local communities.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;The proposition that children should watch TV regularly in both school and at home due to its potential to enhance their learning efficiency is a highly debated topic. While it is true that television can be an engaging and accessible medium for educational content, I disagree with the notion that children should watch TV regularly as a primary means of learning.On the one hand, educational television programs can be a valuable supplement to traditional teaching methods, especially for young children. Shows like Sesame Street and Blue's Clues have been widely praised for their ability to convey complex concepts in a fun and interactive manner. Moreover, for children with learning difficulties or those living in areas with limited access to quality educational resources, TV can provide a vital means of accessing knowledge.On the other hand, excessive TV watching has been linked to a range of negative outcomes, including decreased attention span, increased risk of obesity, and delayed cognitive development. Furthermore, the vast majority of television programming is not designed with educational value in mind, and can instead promote unhealthy values and behaviors. In schools, where the primary focus should be on hands-on, interactive learning and socialization, TV watching can detract from more effective teaching methods. Similarly, at home, parents should prioritize activities that promote physical activity, creativity, and social interaction over passive screen time.In conclusion, while television can be a useful tool in certain contexts, I firmly believe that regular TV watching should not be encouraged as a primary means of learning. Rather, a balanced approach that incorporates TV as one part of a broader educational strategy, alongside more traditional and interactive methods, is likely to yield the most positive outcomes for children.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;The widespread use of the internet has revolutionized the way people work and study, making it possible for them to do so from the comfort of their own homes. This phenomenon has sparked a heated debate about whether the advantages of working or studying from home outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, the benefits of this trend far exceed the drawbacks.On the one hand, working or studying from home offers numerous advantages. Firstly, it saves time and money that would be spent on commuting to work or college. This, in turn, reduces stress and increases productivity, as individuals can allocate more time to their work or studies. Additionally, working from home provides flexibility, allowing people to create their own schedules and work at times when they are most productive. This is particularly beneficial for those with caregiving responsibilities or health conditions that make it difficult to work in an office environment.On the other hand, some argue that working or studying from home can lead to social isolation, decreased motivation, and distractions. However, I believe that these disadvantages can be mitigated with discipline and effective time management. Moreover, technology has made it easier for people to stay connected with colleagues, classmates, and friends through video conferencing tools, online forums, and social media.In conclusion, the advantages of working or studying from home, such as increased productivity, flexibility, and reduced stress, outweigh the disadvantages. While there are some potential drawbacks, they can be managed with the right mindset and tools. As the world becomes increasingly digital, I believe that working and studying from home will become the norm, offering individuals the freedom to work and learn in a way that suits them best.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;The rise of international tourism has led to a surge in cultural exchange between people from different backgrounds. While some argue that this increased interaction can cause tension, I firmly believe that it leads to a greater understanding between countries.On the one hand, it is possible that cultural differences can cause misunderstandings and tension. When tourists visit a foreign country, they may unintentionally offend locals by not respecting their customs or traditions. For example, in some cultures, it is considered rude to finish a meal completely, as it implies that the host did not provide enough food. Unaware of these nuances, tourists may inadvertently cause offense, leading to tension.On the other hand, I believe that the benefits of international tourism far outweigh the potential drawbacks. When people from different cultures interact, they have the opportunity to learn about and appreciate each other's customs and ways of life. This exchange can lead to a greater understanding and tolerance of cultural differences. For instance, many tourists who visit Japan are fascinated by the country's unique customs and traditions, such as the tea ceremony and the art of calligraphy. By participating in and learning about these customs, tourists gain a deeper appreciation of Japanese culture, which can help to break down cultural barriers.Moreover, international tourism can also promote economic cooperation and diplomacy between countries. When tourists visit a foreign country, they contribute to the local economy, which can lead to increased trade and investment between nations. This economic cooperation can, in turn, foster greater diplomatic relations and a deeper understanding between countries.In conclusion, while cultural differences can cause tension, I firmly believe that international tourism leads to a greater understanding between countries. By promoting cultural exchange, economic cooperation, and diplomacy, international tourism has the potential to break down cultural barriers and foster greater global understanding.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;The statement that celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and that this sets a bad example to young people is a widely debated topic. In my opinion, I agree to a great extent with this statement.On one hand, it is undeniable that the lives of celebrities are highly publicized in the media, with their every move being scrutinized and reported on. As a result, their glamorous lifestyles and wealth are often highlighted and idolized by the public. Young people, in particular, are impressionable and may look up to these celebrities as role models. When they see their idols flaunting their wealth and material possessions, they may begin to equate success with fame and fortune, rather than with hard work and achievement.On the other hand, there are some celebrities who use their platform to promote positive values and achievements. For example, many celebrities are involved in charitable work and use their fame to raise awareness for important social causes. These individuals set a good example for young people, showing them that success is not just about accumulating wealth, but about making a positive impact on the world.In conclusion, while there are some exceptions, I agree that the emphasis on glamour and wealth in celebrity culture can set a bad example for young people. However, it is also important to recognize that there are many celebrities who use their fame to promote positive values and achievements. Ultimately, it is up to parents, educators, and the media to promote a balanced view of success and to encourage young people to look up to role models who embody hard work, dedication, and a commitment to making a positive impact.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;The notion that children can effectively learn from watching television has been a topic of debate among educators and parents. While some argue that TV can be a valuable learning tool, others believe that it can have a negative impact on children's cognitive and social development. In my opinion, I disagree that children should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school.On the one hand, it is true that some TV programs, such as educational documentaries and children's shows, can be informative and engaging for young learners. These programs can help children develop important skills, such as literacy, numeracy, and social skills. For example, shows like Sesame Street and Blue's Clues have been praised for their ability to promote learning and cognitive development in young children.On the other hand, excessive TV watching can have negative effects on children's physical, emotional, and social well-being. Watching too much TV can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health problems. Moreover, exposure to violent or aggressive content on TV can desensitize children to the negative effects of violence and aggression. Furthermore, TV can also limit children's opportunities for social interaction, play, and exploration, which are essential for healthy development.In the classroom, teachers can use TV programs as a supplementary learning tool, but it should not replace hands-on, interactive learning experiences. Children learn best through play, experimentation, and social interaction, which cannot be replicated by TV alone. In addition, schools should focus on promoting critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, skills that are not typically developed through TV watching.In conclusion, while TV can be a useful learning tool in moderation, it should not be encouraged as a primary means of learning in both home and school. Children need a balanced and diverse learning environment that includes hands-on experiences, social interaction, and physical activity, which TV alone cannot provide.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;The notion that workers over 50 are less responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace is a contentious issue that has sparked intense debate. While some argue that younger workers are better suited to adapt to the fast-paced and ever-evolving work environment, I firmly reject this idea.Firstly, it is essential to recognize that age is not a determining factor in an individual's ability to adapt to change. Many workers over 50 possess valuable experience, skills, and knowledge that enable them to navigate complex and dynamic work environments with ease. In fact, research has shown that older workers tend to have higher levels of emotional intelligence, problem-solving skills, and decision-making abilities, which are essential for effective adaptation to change.Furthermore, the idea that younger workers are inherently more responsive to change is an oversimplification of the issue. Younger workers may have grown up in a digital age, but this does not necessarily mean they are better equipped to handle the demands of a rapidly changing workplace. In fact, many younger workers may lack the experience and maturity to effectively navigate complex organizational dynamics, manage competing priorities, and maintain a high level of productivity in the face of uncertainty.Moreover, older workers bring a unique set of skills and perspectives to the workplace that are invaluable in today's fast-paced and interconnected business environment. Their experience and wisdom can provide a stabilizing influence, helping to mitigate the risks associated with rapid change and ensure that organizational knowledge and expertise are preserved.In conclusion, the notion that workers over 50 are less responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace is a misguided and discriminatory idea. Older workers possess a wealth of experience, skills, and knowledge that make them valuable assets to any organization. Rather than prioritizing younger workers, employers should focus on creating inclusive and supportive work environments that enable workers of all ages to thrive and contribute to the organization's success.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The increasing use of machines in our daily lives has undoubtedly transformed the way we work and live. While some may argue that the advantages of machines outweigh the disadvantages, others may contend that the reduction in physical work done by humans has negative consequences. In my opinion, the benefits of machines far outweigh the drawbacks.On the one hand, machines have greatly increased efficiency and productivity in various industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation. Automation has enabled companies to produce goods and services at a faster rate, resulting in lower costs and higher quality. Additionally, machines have taken over hazardous and mundane tasks, improving work safety and freeing humans to focus on more creative and strategic tasks. For instance, robots are being used in medical surgeries, allowing for more precise and minimally invasive procedures.On the other hand, the reduction in physical work done by humans has raised concerns about the impact on our physical and mental health. Prolonged periods of inactivity can lead to obesity, diabetes, and other health problems. Moreover, the loss of manual skills and traditional crafts can result in cultural homogenization and the loss of unique community identities.However, I argue that the advantages of machines far outweigh these disadvantages. Machines have opened up new opportunities for people with disabilities, enabling them to participate in the workforce and lead more independent lives. Furthermore, the time saved from manual labor can be invested in education, innovation, and personal development, leading to a more knowledgeable and skilled workforce. While it is essential to address the potential negative consequences of machine use, I firmly believe that the benefits of machines will continue to shape our world for the better.In conclusion, the increasing use of machines is a natural progression of human innovation, and I believe that the advantages of machines outweigh the disadvantages. As we continue to harness the power of technology, it is crucial that we address the potential drawbacks and ensure that the benefits of machines are equitably distributed, leading to a brighter and more prosperous future for all.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;In recent years, the world has witnessed unprecedented technological advancements, leading to a surge in development across various countries. While these developments have undoubtedly improved the quality of life, concerns have been raised about the impact on traditional skills and ways of life. The statement that these skills and ways of life are doomed to die out and that it is pointless to try and keep them alive is a topic of contention.On one hand, technological advancements often render traditional skills obsolete, as newer, more efficient methods emerge. The widespread adoption of machines and automation has reduced the need for manual labor, leading to a decline in traditional craftsmanship. For instance, the introduction of power looms has significantly reduced the demand for handmade textiles. In such cases, it may seem pointless to try and keep these traditional skills alive.On the other hand, many traditional skills and ways of life hold significant cultural and historical value. Preserving these skills not only helps maintain cultural heritage but also provides a sense of identity and continuity with the past. Moreover, many traditional skills, such as craftsmanship, can provide a unique and personalized touch to products, which can be a valuable asset in an increasingly homogenized world.Furthermore, it is not necessarily a zero-sum game between tradition and technology. In many cases, technology can be used to support and enhance traditional skills, rather than replace them. For example, digital platforms can provide a global market for artisans to sell their handmade products, allowing them to reach a wider audience and sustain their craft.In conclusion, while technological advancements may render some traditional skills obsolete, it is not entirely pointless to try and keep them alive. By preserving and promoting these skills, we can maintain our cultural heritage and provide a unique value proposition in an increasingly globalized world.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;The notion that reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education, or shopping is the sole solution to alleviate traffic congestion in cities has garnered significant attention in recent years. While this approach has its merits, I disagree with the idea that it is the only way to reduce traffic in urban areas.On one hand, decreasing the need for travel can significantly minimize the number of vehicles on the road. With the advent of remote work, online education, and e-commerce, people can now accomplish various tasks from the comfort of their homes. This shift has the potential to reduce traffic volume, especially during peak hours. Moreover, it can also promote a more sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle.On the other hand, this approach is not a panacea for traffic congestion. Cities are complex systems with multifaceted transportation needs, and reducing travel demand is only one aspect of the solution. Other factors such as inefficient road networks, inadequate public transportation, and a lack of alternative modes of transportation also contribute to traffic congestion. Therefore, a more comprehensive approach is necessary to address these underlying issues.Additionally, reducing travel demand may not be feasible or desirable for everyone. Some people may still need to commute to work or school due to the nature of their jobs or educational requirements. Others may prefer the social interactions and community engagement that come with traveling to public spaces. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between reducing travel demand and investing in efficient and sustainable transportation infrastructure.In conclusion, while reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education, or shopping can be an effective strategy to alleviate traffic congestion, it is not the only solution. A more holistic approach that addresses the complexities of urban transportation systems and accommodates the diverse needs of city dwellers is necessary to create a more efficient and sustainable urban environment.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;The celebrity culture has been a dominant force in modern society, with many young people looking up to famous individuals as role models. However, the argument that celebrities are usually famous for their glamour and wealth rather than their achievements raises concerns about the potential dangers of emulating them. In this essay, I will argue that I agree to a large extent with this statement.On one hand, celebrities are often revered for their physical appearance, luxurious lifestyles, and high-profile relationships, rather than their actual accomplishments. The media frequently focuses on their fashion sense, expensive possessions, and scandalous behaviors, creating a distorted view of what it means to be successful. As a result, young people may become fixated on attaining fame and wealth, rather than developing valuable skills or contributing to society in meaningful ways. This can lead to unrealistic expectations and a misguided sense of what is truly important in life.Furthermore, the emphasis on celebrity culture can also perpetuate unhealthy values, such as materialism and narcissism. When young people idolize celebrities who are famous for being famous, they may adopt similar values and behaviors, prioritizing self-promotion and superficial appearances over personal growth and self-awareness. This can have negative consequences, including decreased self-esteem, anxiety, and a lack of direction in life.On the other hand, some celebrities do use their platforms to promote positive values and inspire young people to make a difference in the world. For example, actors like Leonardo DiCaprio and Emma Watson have used their fame to raise awareness about environmental issues and women's rights, respectively. However, these examples are the exception rather than the rule.In conclusion, while there are some positive examples of celebrities using their fame for good, I believe that the emphasis on glamour and wealth in celebrity culture can be dangerous for young people. It is essential for young individuals to have role models who promote values such as hard work, kindness, and social responsibility, rather than superficial fame and wealth.
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;The notion of accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject at universities has sparked intense debate. While proponents argue that this approach would promote gender equality, I partly disagree with this stance, as it may not be practical or beneficial in all cases.On one hand, ensuring equal representation of males and females in every subject can help bridge the gender gap in fields where one sex is underrepresented. For instance, encouraging more women to pursue STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) can lead to a more diverse and inclusive academic environment. Additionally, equal representation can challenge traditional stereotypes and provide role models for students of both sexes.On the other hand, enforcing equal numbers of males and females in every subject may not be feasible or desirable. Some subjects may naturally attract more students of one sex, due to differences in interests or aptitudes. For example, nursing and midwifery programs tend to have more female students, while engineering programs often have more male students. Imposing quotas or limits on admissions could lead to less qualified students being accepted, compromising academic standards.Furthermore, universities should focus on providing equal opportunities and support for students of both sexes, rather than enforcing equal numbers. This can be achieved by offering scholarships, mentorship programs, and resources that cater to the needs of students from underrepresented groups. By doing so, universities can promote diversity and inclusion without compromising academic excellence.In conclusion, while I agree that promoting gender equality is essential, I believe that accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Universities should prioritize creating inclusive environments that support students of both sexes, rather than enforcing rigid quotas. By striking a balance between diversity and academic excellence, universities can provide students with the best possible education and prepare them for success in their chosen fields.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;"The statement ""All countries should make these rules"" in regards to banning smoking in all public places, except for designated areas, is a topic of ongoing debate. While it is a well-established fact that smoking is detrimental to one's health, the decision to implement such a rule globally is more complex.On one hand, I agree with the notion that restricting smoking in public places is beneficial for the health and well-being of non-smokers. Secondhand smoke is a proven carcinogen, and reducing exposure to it can prevent various health problems. Furthermore, by limiting smoking areas, governments can promote a culture that discourages smoking, particularly among the younger population. It is essential for governments to protect their citizens from harm, and implementing anti-smoking regulations is a step in the right direction.On the other hand, I also understand that this is a matter of personal freedom and individual choice. While some people may view smoking as a habit that should be eradicated, others see it as a legitimate choice that they should be free to make. Implementing such a rule globally could lead to resentment among smokers and potential black markets for cigarettes.Considering the pros and cons, I believe that countries should implement their own anti-smoking regulations based on their unique cultural, social, and economic contexts. Instead of a blanket rule, governments can assess their populations' needs and preferences to create effective policies that balance individual freedom with public health concerns. By taking a nuanced approach, governments can promote healthier lifestyles without infringing upon personal liberties.In conclusion, while restricting smoking in public places is beneficial for public health, it is essential to consider the diverse needs and preferences of different countries. A one-size-fits-all approach might not be the most effective solution, and governments should instead strive to create regulations that cater to their unique contexts."
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;The assertion that tourism is a modern form of colonialism is a contentious issue that warrants scrutiny. While tourism can have detrimental effects on local economies and environments, it is overly simplistic to categorize it as a form of colonialism.On one hand, there are legitimate concerns that tourism can lead to the exploitation of local resources and economies. The influx of tourists can drive up prices, making it difficult for locals to afford basic necessities. Furthermore, the environmental impact of tourism, such as pollution and habitat destruction, can be devastating. The loss of biodiversity and degradation of natural habitats can have long-lasting effects on ecosystems.On the other hand, tourism can also have positive effects on local economies. In many developing countries, tourism is a vital source of income and employment. Well-managed tourism can also promote cultural exchange and understanding, fostering greater appreciation and respect for local customs and traditions.Moreover, it is unfair to categorize all forms of tourism as colonialism. Responsible and sustainable tourism practices can help to mitigate the negative impacts of tourism and ensure that local communities benefit from tourism activities. Community-based tourism initiatives, for example, can empower local people to take ownership of tourism development and ensure that benefits are shared equitably.In conclusion, while tourism can have negative consequences, it is not entirely accurate to equate it with colonialism. The relationship between tourism and local economies is complex, and the impact of tourism depends on how it is managed and regulated. By adopting sustainable and responsible tourism practices, we can minimize the negative effects and maximize the benefits of tourism for local communities.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;The past two decades have witnessed tremendous advancements in the field of Information Technology (IT), revolutionizing the way people communicate, access information, and conduct various tasks. The World Wide Web and email have been instrumental in bridging geographical gaps and fostering global connectivity. However, the assertion that future developments in IT will have more negative effects than positive is a topic of debate.While it is true that the rapid pace of technological progress can lead to unforeseen consequences, I do not entirely agree with the view that future developments in IT will be predominantly negative. On the one hand, the increasing reliance on technology can lead to issues such as job displacement, social isolation, and decreased attention span. Moreover, the exponential growth of data and the need for sophisticated data storage and security measures can pose significant environmental and cyber security concerns.On the other hand, future IT developments have the potential to bring about numerous benefits that outweigh the drawbacks. For instance, advancements in artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) can lead to breakthroughs in healthcare, education, and sustainable energy solutions. Furthermore, emerging technologies like blockchain can facilitate secure and transparent transactions, thereby enhancing trust and accountability.To mitigate the negative effects of IT developments, it is essential to prioritize responsible innovation, emphasizing ethics, sustainability, and inclusivity. By doing so, we can harness the potential of IT to drive positive change and create a more equitable and connected world. In conclusion, while acknowledging the potential drawbacks of future IT developments, I firmly believe that their benefits can be maximized with thoughtful planning, collaborative effort, and a commitment to harnessing technology for the betterment of society.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;The rise of vegetarianism has become a notable trend in recent years, with an increasing number of people adopting a plant-based diet. While some may believe that the primary motivation behind this shift is concern for animal rights, it is not the sole reason. In fact, many individuals are choosing to become vegetarians for a variety of reasons beyond animal welfare.One of the primary drivers of this trend is the growing awareness of the health benefits associated with a vegetarian diet. A well-planned vegetarian diet has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. With the rise of chronic diseases, people are becoming more health-conscious and are turning to vegetarianism as a means of improving their overall well-being. Additionally, the high cost of healthcare and the increasing incidence of lifestyle diseases have led many to seek preventive measures, with a plant-based diet being a key aspect of this approach.Another reason why people are embracing vegetarianism is the growing concern for the environment. Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. As individuals become more environmentally aware, they are seeking ways to reduce their carbon footprint, and a vegetarian diet is seen as a practical and effective way to do so.Furthermore, the increasing availability and variety of plant-based foods have made it easier for people to adopt a vegetarian diet. The rise of vegetarian and vegan restaurants, meal delivery services, and online recipes has catered to the growing demand for plant-based options, making it more accessible and convenient for individuals to make the switch.In conclusion, while animal rights issues may be a factor in some individuals' decision to adopt a vegetarian diet, it is by no means the only reason. The growing awareness of the health benefits, environmental concerns, and increasing accessibility of plant-based foods have all contributed to the rising trend of vegetarianism.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;The notion that traditional skills and ways of life inevitably die out as a country develops its technology has become a widely debated topic. In my opinion, while it is true that technological advancements can lead to a decline in traditional practices, I disagree with the idea that it is pointless to try and keep them alive.On one hand, the increasing reliance on technology can undoubtedly lead to the erosion of traditional skills. For instance, the rise of automation in industries such as manufacturing and agriculture has reduced the need for manual labor, rendering many traditional skills obsolete. Furthermore, the widespread use of digital tools and social media has diminished the importance of traditional communication methods, such as letter-writing and face-to-face interaction.On the other hand, I firmly believe that it is worth preserving traditional skills and ways of life. Not only do they hold cultural significance and provide a link to a country's heritage, but they also offer a unique perspective and skillset that can complement modern technology. For example, traditional craftsmanship, such as woodworking and textiles, can be used to create unique and sustainable products that cannot be replicated by machines.Moreover, many traditional skills, such as farming and cooking, are not only essential for self-sufficiency but also promote a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. By preserving these skills, we can also preserve the environment and promote a more balanced way of living. In addition, preserving traditional skills can also help to promote tourism and economic growth, as people become increasingly interested in experiencing and learning about different cultures.In conclusion, while it is true that technological advancements can lead to a decline in traditional practices, I strongly disagree with the idea that it is pointless to try and keep them alive. Preserving traditional skills and ways of life is essential for promoting cultural heritage, sustainability, and economic growth.
372;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime."" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the ""legalized revenge"" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.Finally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. To conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty.";The statement that without capital punishment our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase is a widely debated topic. Some argue that capital punishment is essential to control violence in society, while others believe that it does not necessarily lead to a decrease in violent crimes.On one hand, the argument that capital punishment serves as a deterrent to violent crimes is a valid one. The fear of facing the ultimate penalty may prevent some individuals from committing heinous crimes. Furthermore, capital punishment provides a sense of justice and closure for the families of victims, which can be an important factor in the healing process. Additionally, it can be argued that keeping violent offenders alive would require significant financial resources, which could be better spent on prevention and rehabilitation programs.On the other hand, numerous studies have shown that the implementation of capital punishment does not necessarily lead to a decrease in violent crimes. In fact, some countries with capital punishment have higher rates of violent crime compared to those without it. Moreover, there is always a risk of executing an innocent person, which is a grave miscarriage of justice. It also perpetuates a cycle of violence, rather than addressing the root causes of crime.In conclusion, while capital punishment may provide a sense of justice and deter some individuals from committing violent crimes, its effectiveness in controlling violence in society is questionable. It is a complex issue, and there is no clear evidence to support the claim that capital punishment is essential to control violence. Instead, it is crucial to focus on prevention, rehabilitation, and addressing the root causes of crime to create a safer and more secure society.
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;I disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. While some may argue that zoos are inhumane or only serve as a form of entertainment, I believe they play a vital role in conservation, education, and research.One of the primary purposes of a zoo is to conserve and protect endangered species. Many zoos participate in breeding programs that help to increase the population of species that are at risk of extinction. For example, the California Condor Recovery Program, which is a collaboration between zoos and wildlife agencies, has helped to increase the population of California condors from just 22 individuals in the 1980s to over 500 today. Zoos also provide a safe haven for animals that have been injured or orphaned in the wild, giving them a second chance at life.In addition to conservation, zoos also serve as important educational institutions. By providing a unique opportunity for people to see and learn about animals up close, zoos inspire a love of wildlife and a desire to protect it. Many zoos offer educational programs and activities that teach people about the importance of conservation and the impact of human activities on the environment.Zoos also play a crucial role in scientific research. By studying animals in a controlled environment, scientists can gain a better understanding of animal behavior, physiology, and psychology. This knowledge can be used to inform conservation efforts and improve the care of animals in zoos and in the wild.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Zoos play a vital role in conservation, education, and research, and are an important tool in the fight to protect and preserve wildlife.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";The debate about whether governments should allocate public funds to preserve endangered languages has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some argue that investing in the preservation of these languages is a vital endeavor, as they are an integral part of a community's cultural heritage. By supporting linguistic diversity, governments can help maintain the unique identities and traditions of these communities. Moreover, language preservation can also contribute to the world's cultural richness and promote cross-cultural understanding.On the other hand, others contend that allocating public funds to save endangered languages is a waste of resources. They argue that in an increasingly globalized world, languages with limited speakers are unlikely to survive, and that the funds could be better spent on more pressing issues such as education, healthcare, or economic development. Additionally, some may view language preservation as a nostalgic pursuit, rather than a practical investment in the community's future.In my opinion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that governments should allocate some funds to preserve endangered languages. Language is a fundamental aspect of human identity, and its loss can have a profound impact on a community's sense of self and cultural continuity. Moreover, preserving linguistic diversity can also have practical benefits, such as promoting tourism, cultural exchange, and even economic development. Furthermore, in an era where technology is increasingly capable of supporting language documentation and education, the cost of language preservation is relatively low compared to other public expenditures.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that preserving endangered languages is a worthwhile investment in a community's cultural heritage and identity. By allocating a modest portion of public funds to language preservation, governments can help maintain linguistic diversity, promote cultural exchange, and support the unique identities of communities around the world.
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";The allocation of a country's health budget is a critical decision that can have far-reaching consequences for its citizens. While some argue that a large proportion of the health budget should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures, I agree to a certain extent with this statement.On one hand, preventative measures and health education are essential for maintaining a healthy population. By investing in initiatives that promote healthy lifestyles, disease prevention, and early detection, governments can reduce the burden on the healthcare system. For instance, vaccination programs, health screenings, and public awareness campaigns can prevent the spread of diseases, reducing the number of hospitalizations and treatments required. Moreover, health education can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their health, leading to better health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs in the long run.On the other hand, diverting a large proportion of the budget from treatment to preventative measures may have unintended consequences. Hospitals and healthcare facilities still require significant funding to provide quality treatment and care to those who need it. Reducing the budget for treatment could lead to a shortage of medical supplies, equipment, and staff, compromising the quality of care and putting patients' lives at risk.Therefore, I believe that a balanced approach is necessary. A moderate allocation of the health budget towards preventative measures and health education, while maintaining sufficient funding for treatment and healthcare services, is the most effective way forward. By investing in both prevention and treatment, governments can create a comprehensive healthcare system that promotes healthy lifestyles, prevents diseases, and provides quality care to those in need. Ultimately, finding the right balance is crucial to ensuring the well-being of a country's citizens.
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;"The notion that university education should be restricted to the very best academic students has been a topic of ongoing debate. While some argue that this approach would improve the overall quality of students and ensure that those who do attend university are truly equipped to succeed, I disagree with this perspective.Firstly, restricting university education to only the top academic students would result in a significant number of talented and motivated individuals being denied the opportunity to pursue higher education. Many students who do not necessarily excel in a traditional academic setting may still possess a range of skills, abilities, and interests that would enable them to make valuable contributions in various fields. By excluding these students, we risk losing out on a diverse range of perspectives, ideas, and innovations that could benefit society as a whole.Furthermore, access to university education is not solely about academic achievement; it is also about social mobility and equality of opportunity. Limiting university places to only the most academically gifted students would disproportionately disadvantage students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, who may not have had the same access to resources, support, and opportunities as their more affluent peers. This would only serve to exacerbate existing social inequalities and limit social mobility.Instead of restricting access to university, I believe that efforts should focus on improving the quality of teaching, resources, and support available to all students, regardless of their academic background. This would enable students from all walks of life to reach their full potential and make the most of their university experience. Ultimately, I firmly believe that university education should be available to a large proportion of young people, as it provides a vital pathway to personal growth, social mobility, and economic prosperity."
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;"The statement ""Parents are the best teachers"" is a notion that has been debated for centuries. While some people believe that parents play a significant role in shaping their children's knowledge and skills, others argue that this statement is not entirely accurate. In my opinion, I disagree with the statement, and here's why.Firstly, parents may not possess the necessary expertise to teach their children certain subjects or skills. For instance, parents may not be proficient in a particular language or subject, making it challenging for them to provide effective guidance. In contrast, professional teachers undergo rigorous training and have extensive knowledge in their field, enabling them to provide high-quality education.Secondly, parents may have biased perspectives or limited experiences that can influence their teaching methods. For example, a parent's own cultural or social biases may be passed down to their child, potentially limiting their exposure to diverse viewpoints. On the other hand, professional teachers are trained to provide a balanced and inclusive education, exposing students to various perspectives and ideas.Lastly, parents may not be able to provide the structured learning environment that children need to thrive. While parents can offer emotional support and encouragement, professional teachers create a structured learning environment that fosters discipline, time management, and socialization skills. Moreover, schools provide a safe and supportive space for children to learn and interact with peers, which is essential for their cognitive and emotional development.In conclusion, while parents play a vital role in their children's upbringing, they are not necessarily the best teachers. Professional teachers, with their expertise, objectivity, and structured learning environments, are better equipped to provide children with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary for success."
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;"When choosing a job, there are various factors to consider, and the importance of each factor may vary from person to person. While salary is undoubtedly a crucial aspect, I disagree that it is the most important consideration for everyone.On one hand, a decent salary is essential to cover living expenses and provide financial stability. It is a primary motivator for many individuals, particularly those with families to support or financial obligations to meet. A higher salary can also lead to better job security, benefits, and opportunities for career advancement. Therefore, it is natural that salary is a significant factor in job selection.On the other hand, there are other essential considerations that can outweigh the importance of salary. For instance, job satisfaction and personal fulfillment are critical to an individual's overall well-being and happiness. A job that aligns with one's passions, values, and skills can lead to a more enjoyable and meaningful work experience, even if the salary is not the highest. Moreover, work-life balance, opportunities for growth and development, and a positive work environment are also vital considerations that can impact an individual's quality of life.Furthermore, research has shown that once basic needs are met, additional income does not necessarily lead to greater happiness. This is known as the ""Easterlin paradox."" Therefore, prioritizing salary above other factors may not necessarily lead to greater job satisfaction or overall well-being.In conclusion, while salary is an important consideration when choosing a job, it is not the only factor, and its importance can vary from person to person. Other aspects such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and opportunities for growth and development should also be taken into account. Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers multiple factors is likely to lead to a more fulfilling and successful career."
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;The proposal to significantly increase taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage the use of private cars is a contentious issue. On one hand, I support the idea as it aims to reduce the environmental impact of burning oil for transportation. The excessive use of private cars is indeed wasteful and environmentally irresponsible, contributing to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change.Increasing taxation on petrol and diesel fuel would likely discourage people from using private cars, especially for daily commutes. This could lead to a shift towards more environmentally friendly modes of transportation, such as public transport, carpooling, and cycling. Additionally, the revenue generated from the increased taxation could be used to invest in sustainable transportation infrastructure, such as electric vehicle charging stations and public transport systems.On the other hand, I also recognize that such a policy could have unintended consequences, particularly for low-income households and those living in areas with limited public transport options. For many people, private cars are a necessity, and increasing fuel costs could lead to financial hardship. Furthermore, alternative modes of transportation may not be readily available or accessible in all areas, making it difficult for people to adjust to the new tax regime.In conclusion, while I support the idea of increasing taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage the use of private cars, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences and implement measures to mitigate them. The government could consider introducing subsidies or incentives for low-income households, investing in public transport infrastructure, and implementing policies to promote alternative modes of transportation. By striking a balance between environmental concerns and social equity, we can work towards a more sustainable transportation system.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;The notion that a police force carrying guns encourages a higher level of violence in society is a contentious issue that has sparked debate among scholars, policymakers, and the general public. While some argue that arming the police leads to a more violent society, others claim that it is a necessary measure to maintain law and order. In my opinion, I agree with the former viewpoint, but with some caveats.On one hand, arming the police can lead to a culture of aggression and violence. When police officers are equipped with firearms, they may be more likely to resort to using them, even in situations where they are not strictly necessary. This can lead to a escalation of violence, particularly in situations where a peaceful resolution could have been achieved. Furthermore, the presence of firearms can also create a sense of fear and mistrust among the public, leading to a breakdown in the relationship between law enforcement and the community.On the other hand, there are situations where arming the police is necessary to protect them from harm and to maintain public safety. In high-risk situations, such as responding to armed robberies or terrorist attacks, firearms may be necessary to prevent harm to the public and the police themselves. Additionally, in countries with high levels of gun ownership and crime, arming the police may be a necessary measure to maintain law and order.However, I believe that these exceptions do not justify the widespread arming of police forces. Instead, police should focus on de-escalation techniques, community policing, and building trust with the public. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing violence and improving public safety in countries such as the UK and Norway, where police officers are largely unarmed. In conclusion, while there may be some situations where arming the police is necessary, I believe that it can encourage a higher level of violence in society and that alternative approaches should be prioritized.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;The integration of technology into education has revolutionized the way students learn. I strongly agree with the statement that, with the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. There are several reasons to support this assertion.Firstly, technology has provided students with an unprecedented wealth of information at their fingertips. The internet has democratized access to knowledge, allowing students to learn from a vast array of sources, including online libraries, educational websites, and academic journals. For instance, online resources such as Khan Academy and Coursera offer high-quality educational content that can supplement traditional classroom learning.Secondly, technology has enabled students to learn at their own pace. Interactive educational software and apps allow students to revisit concepts as many times as they need, thereby reinforcing their understanding. Additionally, multimedia content, such as videos and animations, can facilitate deeper understanding and engagement with complex subjects.Thirdly, technology has facilitated collaboration and communication among students. Online platforms and tools, such as discussion forums and virtual whiteboards, enable students to work together on projects, share ideas, and receive feedback from their peers. This collaborative approach to learning can foster creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.Lastly, technology has also enabled personalized learning. Adaptive learning systems and AI-powered tools can tailor the learning experience to individual students' needs, abilities, and learning styles. For example, AI-powered tutoring systems can provide real-time feedback and adjust the difficulty level of course materials based on a student's performance.In conclusion, technology has undoubtedly transformed the learning landscape. With its help, students can access a vast array of information, learn at their own pace, collaborate with peers, and benefit from personalized learning experiences. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that students will have even more opportunities to learn more information and learn it more quickly.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;Over the past century, humanity has witnessed unprecedented technological advancements, transforming the world in unimaginable ways. While these innovations have undoubtedly improved our lives in various aspects, I firmly believe that the negative effects on people's lives far outweigh the benefits.On the one hand, technological progress has enhanced global connectivity, streamlined communication, and provided unparalleled access to information. The internet, mobile devices, and social media platforms have revolutionized the way we interact, work, and learn. Additionally, technological advancements in medicine, transportation, and energy have significantly improved our standard of living.On the other hand, the drawbacks of technological progress cannot be ignored. The over-reliance on technology has led to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to rising obesity rates, decreased physical activity, and related health issues. Moreover, the constant stream of information has resulted in decreased attention span, increased stress levels, and a loss of face-to-face communication skills. Cyberbullying, online harassment, and social isolation have also become significant concerns.Furthermore, the environmental impact of technological progress has been devastating. The production and disposal of electronic waste have contributed to pollution, climate change, and resource depletion. The unsustainable consumption of resources has also led to the depletion of natural resources, threatening the planet's ecosystem.In conclusion, while technological progress has undoubtedly improved various aspects of our lives, I firmly believe that the negative effects on people's lives outweigh the benefits. As we continue to advance technologically, it is essential to address these concerns and strive for a more balanced and sustainable approach to innovation. By acknowledging the drawbacks of technological progress, we can work towards creating a better future for ourselves and the planet.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";The presence of violence in television programs has long been a topic of debate. While some argue that it is a reflection of reality and serves as a means of entertainment, others contend that it has a negative impact on viewers, particularly children. In my opinion, I strongly agree that the amount of violence in television programs should be reduced.Exposure to violent content can have serious consequences, especially for young viewers. Research has shown that repeated exposure to violence can lead to desensitization, increased aggression, and a decrease in empathy. Children who watch violent television programs are more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior, and are at a higher risk of developing mental health problems. Furthermore, excessive violence on television can also perpetuate negative stereotypes and reinforce harmful social norms.Moreover, reducing violence in television programs can have a positive impact on society as a whole. By promoting more positive and constructive themes, television can play a role in shaping cultural values and influencing social attitudes. This, in turn, can contribute to a more harmonious and respectful society. Additionally, reducing violence in television programs can also set a better example for children, teaching them important values such as kindness, respect, and conflict resolution.In conclusion, the amount of violence in television programs is a concern that should be addressed. By reducing the amount of violence on television, we can promote a more positive and respectful culture, and help to protect the well-being of our children. It is the responsibility of television producers, regulators, and parents to ensure that the content of television programs is suitable for all audiences, and that it promotes values that are beneficial to society.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The notion that arming police forces leads to a higher level of violence in a society is a contentious issue. While some people argue that the presence of guns among law enforcement personnel contributes to an escalation of violence, I partially disagree with this opinion.On one hand, there is a valid argument that the introduction of guns into a situation can heighten tensions and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations. The presence of firearms can lead to a greater sense of intimidation, and in some cases, may provoke individuals to respond aggressively. Additionally, if officers are armed, they may be more inclined to use their firearms in situations that could otherwise be resolved through non-lethal means. This can lead to avoidable deaths and further exacerbate violence.On the other hand, the primary purpose of arming police forces is to protect both the officers and the public from harm. In situations where officers face a genuine threat, having access to firearms can be a necessary deterrent. Furthermore, countries with well-trained and accountable police forces, such as the United Kingdom, have demonstrated that the judicious use of firearms by officers can coexist with low levels of societal violence.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the possibility that arming police forces can contribute to higher levels of violence, I do not believe that this is an inevitable outcome. The key to mitigating potential negative consequences lies in ensuring that officers receive thorough training on the appropriate use of firearms, and that there are robust accountability mechanisms in place. By adopting a nuanced and multifaceted approach, it is possible to minimize the risks associated with arming police forces, while also maintaining the safety and security of both officers and the public.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";While some may argue that classmates play a more significant role in a child's academic success, I firmly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, parents are far more influential than classmates in determining a child's success in school.First and foremost, parents set the foundation for their child's educational journey. They instill values, such as the importance of education, hard work, and perseverance, from a very young age. Parents also create a supportive learning environment at home, providing resources and encouragement that enable their child to excel academically. For instance, parents can engage their child in educational activities, such as reading together, solving puzzles, or visiting museums, which can spark their interest in learning and motivate them to perform well in school.Moreover, parents are responsible for modeling the behavior they expect from their child. When parents value education and demonstrate a love for learning, their child is more likely to adopt these attitudes and develop a positive mindset towards school. On the other hand, classmates can have a negative influence on a child's academic success if they do not share the same values or work ethic. For example, if a child's classmates are not interested in learning or do not take their studies seriously, this can lead to a lack of motivation and poor academic performance.While classmates can certainly provide support and encouragement, I believe that parents play a more significant role in shaping their child's academic success. By instilling values, creating a supportive learning environment, and modeling positive behavior, parents lay the groundwork for their child's success in school. Ultimately, a child's academic achievement is more likely to be influenced by their parents than their classmates.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;The notion that living in big cities is detrimental to people's health has been a topic of discussion in recent years. While it is true that urban environments can pose certain health risks, I do not entirely agree that living in big cities is inherently bad for one's health.On one hand, there are valid concerns regarding the negative impact of city living on health. The high levels of air and noise pollution in urban areas can lead to respiratory problems and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, the fast-paced and stressful nature of city life can contribute to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. The lack of green spaces and limited opportunities for physical activity in cities can also exacerbate health problems.On the other hand, many big cities are taking steps to mitigate these issues and create healthier environments for their residents. For example, cities are investing in green infrastructure, such as parks and bike lanes, to encourage physical activity and reduce pollution. Additionally, many urban areas offer a wide range of health and wellness services, including hospitals, gyms, and healthy food options.Moreover, city living can also have numerous health benefits. For instance, cities often have higher concentrations of healthcare facilities and specialized medical services, making it easier for residents to access quality healthcare. The diversity and density of cities also provide opportunities for social interaction and community engagement, which are essential for mental and emotional well-being.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the health impacts of city living, I do not agree that living in big cities is inherently bad for one's health. By acknowledging both the risks and benefits, cities can work towards creating healthier environments that support the well-being of their residents. Ultimately, the key to healthy city living is finding a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of urban life.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;The notion that arming police officers encourages a higher level of violence in a society is a contentious issue. While some argue that it is a necessary measure to ensure the safety of both law enforcement and the general public, others contend that it escalates violence and undermines trust in the police. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement.On the one hand, arming police officers can be seen as a necessary measure to maintain law and order in a society. Police officers are often faced with dangerous situations, and carrying guns can serve as a deterrent to potential threats. Additionally, in situations where officers are faced with armed suspects, having a gun can provide them with a means of self-defense. This, in turn, can prevent unnecessary harm to both the officer and the suspect.On the other hand, I agree that arming police officers can contribute to a culture of violence in a society. The mere presence of guns can create a sense of tension and escalate situations that could otherwise be resolved peacefully. Furthermore, there have been numerous instances where police officers have misused their firearms, resulting in unjustified harm or death to innocent civilians. This not only erodes trust in the police but also perpetuates a cycle of violence.Moreover, it is worth noting that some countries, such as the United Kingdom, have successfully maintained law and order without arming their police officers. Instead, they rely on de-escalation techniques and other non-lethal methods to resolve conflicts.In conclusion, while I acknowledge that arming police officers can be a necessary measure in certain situations, I also believe that it can contribute to a culture of violence in a society. Ultimately, the decision to arm police officers should be carefully considered, taking into account the specific context and needs of a society.
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;The statement that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country is a widely debated topic. While I agree that education plays a pivotal role in a nation's development, I do not believe it is the sole determining factor.On one hand, education is indeed a crucial element in a country's development. It enables individuals to acquire knowledge, skills, and critical thinking abilities, which are essential for economic growth, innovation, and progress. An educated population is more likely to contribute to the workforce, start businesses, and drive innovation, ultimately leading to economic prosperity. Moreover, education has been shown to have a positive impact on social indicators such as health, crime rates, and civic engagement.On the other hand, other factors also play significant roles in a country's development. Infrastructure, technology, and governance, for instance, are equally important. A country with a well-developed infrastructure, robust technology, and effective governance can still progress without a highly educated population. Additionally, natural resources, geographical location, and international relations can also influence a country's development trajectory.Furthermore, it is essential to note that education is not a guarantee of success. Many countries with high literacy rates and well-developed education systems still face significant development challenges. Conversely, some countries with lower education levels have achieved remarkable growth and development through other means.In conclusion, while education is a vital component of a country's development, it is not the single most important factor. A holistic approach that considers multiple elements, including education, infrastructure, governance, and others, is necessary for a country to achieve comprehensive development. Therefore, I agree that education is a crucial factor, but not the sole determining factor, in a country's development.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";The statement that celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, setting a bad example for young people, is a contentious issue. While some argue that the excessive focus on celebrity lifestyles can have a detrimental influence on the younger generation, others believe that it is not entirely fair to generalize that all celebrities are only famous for their wealth and glamour.On one hand, the celebrity culture that we live in today does often emphasize the glamour and wealth of famous individuals. Social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter perpetuate the notion that a celebrity's worth is measured by their material possessions, luxurious lifestyles, and physical appearance. This can lead to a distorted view of what it means to be successful and happy, as young people may feel pressured to emulate the lavish lifestyles of their idols. Moreover, the constant bombardment of celebrity gossip and scandals can divert attention away from the actual talents and achievements of these individuals.On the other hand, there are many celebrities who use their platforms to promote positive values and inspire young people to pursue their passions. For example, many celebrities are advocates for social and environmental causes, using their influence to raise awareness and funds for important issues. Furthermore, the achievements of celebrities in their respective fields should not be understated. Many celebrities have worked tirelessly to hone their craft, and their success is a testament to their dedication and perseverance.In conclusion, while the emphasis on celebrity glamour and wealth can be problematic, it is not entirely accurate to say that all celebrities are only famous for these aspects. Ultimately, it is up to young people to critically evaluate the media they consume and look beyond the superficial aspects of celebrity culture to find role models who embody positive values and inspire them to pursue their own passions and achievements.
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;The impact of mobile phones on social interaction has been a topic of debate in recent years. While some people believe that mobile phones are detrimental to social interaction, others argue that they have no significant impact. In my opinion, mobile phones can indeed have a negative effect on social interaction, but this is not a universal truth.On the one hand, mobile phones can limit face-to-face interaction. People are increasingly relying on their phones to communicate with others, often at the expense of in-person conversations. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, as individuals spend more time interacting with their screens than with real people. Moreover, the constant distractions provided by mobile phones, such as social media and text messages, can make it difficult for people to engage in meaningful conversations.On the other hand, mobile phones can also facilitate social interaction. For example, social media platforms have made it easier for people to connect with others who share similar interests and passions. Video conferencing apps have also enabled people to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away. Additionally, mobile phones can provide people with the opportunity to meet new people and make friends through online communities and forums.In conclusion, while mobile phones can have a negative impact on social interaction, this is not a universal truth. Mobile phones are simply a tool, and like any tool, their impact depends on how they are used. By being mindful of how we use our mobile phones, we can ensure that they enhance our social interactions, rather than detract from them. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to use their mobile phone in a way that promotes healthy and meaningful social interaction.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;The world is grappling with severe environmental problems, including climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss. While it is true that governments and large companies have a significant role to play in mitigating these issues, I disagree with the notion that ordinary people can do little to improve the situation.On one hand, governments and large companies are indeed responsible for implementing policies and practices that have a substantial impact on the environment. They have the resources and influence to drive large-scale change, such as investing in renewable energy, implementing sustainable practices, and enforcing environmental regulations. It is their responsibility to prioritize environmental sustainability and take bold action to reduce their ecological footprint.On the other hand, individual actions may seem insignificant in comparison, but collective efforts can lead to substantial positive change. Ordinary people can make a difference by adopting environmentally friendly habits, such as reducing energy consumption, using public transport or carpooling, recycling, and reducing meat consumption. Additionally, individuals can support organizations and companies that prioritize sustainability, make eco-friendly purchasing decisions, and participate in local environmental initiatives.Furthermore, individual actions can inspire and influence others, creating a ripple effect that can lead to broader societal change. For instance, a neighborhood initiative to reduce plastic use can inspire others to follow suit, creating a community-wide impact. Moreover, individual actions can also hold governments and companies accountable for their environmental actions, pushing them to prioritize sustainability.In conclusion, while governments and large companies have a critical role to play in addressing environmental problems, I firmly believe that ordinary people can also make a significant contribution. Individual actions may seem small, but collective efforts can lead to substantial positive change. By working together, we can create a more sustainable future for all.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;The issue of whether detailed descriptions of crimes in the media have a detrimental impact on society has sparked intense debate. While some argue that such information should be restricted, I partially agree with this stance, as the consequences of unrestricted coverage can be far-reaching and multifaceted.On one hand, graphic descriptions of crimes can lead to desensitization and a heightened sense of fear among the general public. By constantly exposing audiences to gruesome details, the media risks numbing their emotional response to violence and potentially perpetuating a culture of voyeurism. Furthermore, vivid crime scene descriptions can also inspire copycat crimes, as disturbed individuals may seek to replicate the notoriety and attention garnered by the original perpetrator.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that the media plays a crucial role in informing the public and holding authorities accountable for their actions. In some instances, detailed descriptions of crimes can facilitate the apprehension of culprits by providing vital information to potential witnesses. Moreover, responsible reporting can also raise awareness about social issues and promote constructive discussions about crime prevention and rehabilitation.To strike a balance, I propose that the media exercise discretion and responsibility when reporting crimes. Rather than sensationalizing graphic details, they should focus on providing context, highlighting the human impact of crimes, and promoting thoughtful discussions about the root causes of criminal behavior. By adopting a more measured approach, the media can fulfill their duty to inform the public without compromising the well-being of society. Ultimately, while some restrictions on crime reporting may be necessary, they should be carefully considered to avoid undermining the fundamental principles of a free press.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;In the era of digital technology, the necessity of teaching children handwriting skills has sparked a contentious debate. While some argue that handwriting has become obsolete in the modern age, I firmly believe that it remains an essential skill that should continue to be taught in schools.First and foremost, handwriting plays a significant role in cognitive development. Research has shown that writing by hand stimulates the brain, enhancing creativity, memory, and literacy skills. By depriving children of this skill, we may inadvertently hinder their ability to express themselves effectively and process information. Furthermore, handwriting is a fundamental aspect of human communication, allowing individuals to convey emotions, thoughts, and ideas in a unique and personal manner.Moreover, the benefits of handwriting extend beyond the classroom. In an increasingly digital world, handwritten notes, letters, and cards have become a refreshing respite from the monotony of screens. They add a touch of warmth and personality to our interactions, fostering meaningful connections with others. By teaching children the art of handwriting, we are not only equipping them with a practical skill but also with a means of expression and communication that is both personal and timeless.While it is true that technology has made typing a more convenient and efficient means of writing, I disagree that handwriting is unnecessary in the modern age. Rather, it is a complementary skill that should be taught alongside keyboarding skills. By doing so, we can ensure that children develop a comprehensive range of skills that will serve them well in their academic, professional, and personal lives.In conclusion, the skill of handwriting is far from obsolete in the modern age. Its benefits to cognitive development, communication, and personal expression make it an essential part of a child's education. As such, I strongly disagree that teaching children handwriting skills is unnecessary and believe that it should continue to be a fundamental aspect of education.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";I disagree with the statement that families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. While it may seem fair to exempt these families from contributing to the state education system, I believe this exemption would have unintended consequences and be unfair to the broader community.Firstly, the state education system benefits not only those who use it but also the community as a whole. A well-educated population contributes to a more informed, skilled, and productive workforce, which in turn benefits the economy and society. Private school families also benefit from living in a society with a well-educated population, so it is reasonable that they contribute to the system that provides these benefits.Secondly, exempting private school families from paying taxes that support the state education system would create a significant funding shortfall. The state education system relies heavily on taxation to fund schools, teachers, and resources. If private school families were exempt from paying these taxes, the burden would shift to other taxpayers, potentially leading to increased taxes for those who cannot afford private education.Thirdly, this exemption would also perpetuate inequality in the education system. Private schools are often more expensive and exclusive, catering to a wealthier demographic. Exempting these families from paying taxes that support the state education system would further entrench the divide between those who can afford private education and those who cannot.In conclusion, while the statement may seem reasonable at first glance, I firmly believe that families who send their children to private schools should still be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. This is essential for maintaining a well-educated population, ensuring fairness, and promoting equality in the education system.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;I partially agree with the statement that government investment in the arts is a waste of money and should be allocated to public services instead. While it is true that public services such as healthcare and education are essential for the well-being of citizens, I believe that investing in the arts also has numerous benefits that should not be overlooked.On one hand, public services are crucial for providing basic necessities such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Governments have a responsibility to ensure that their citizens have access to these essential services, and investing in them is vital for the development and growth of a country. In times of economic constraint, it may seem logical to prioritize public services over arts funding.On the other hand, investing in the arts can have a significant impact on the economy, culture, and social cohesion of a country. The arts can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and attract tourism, ultimately generating revenue for the government. Moreover, the arts can bring people together, promote cultural understanding, and provide a platform for social commentary and critique. They can also contribute to a country's cultural heritage and national identity.In conclusion, while public services are essential for a country's development, I do not believe that investing in the arts is a complete waste of money. A balanced approach that allocates funding to both public services and the arts would be more beneficial. By investing in the arts, governments can reap economic benefits, promote cultural development, and provide a platform for social expression, ultimately enriching the lives of their citizens.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;The advent of technology has undoubtedly transformed the world, bringing about unprecedented advancements in various spheres of life. However, this rapid progress has also sparked concerns about the preservation of traditional cultures. While some argue that technological advancements inevitably lead to the erosion of traditional cultures, others believe that these two entities can coexist. In this essay, I will argue that it is not entirely inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost with the advancement of technology.On one hand, technology has the potential to disrupt traditional cultures by introducing new values, customs, and ways of life. The widespread use of social media, for instance, has led to the homogenization of cultures, as people from diverse backgrounds are exposed to similar information and cultural influences. This can result in the loss of unique cultural practices and traditions. Furthermore, the increasing reliance on technology can also lead to the decline of traditional skills and crafts, as younger generations opt for more modern and efficient methods.On the other hand, technology can also be a powerful tool for preserving and promoting traditional cultures. The internet, for example, has made it possible for people to access and learn about different cultures from around the world. Digital platforms can also serve as a repository for traditional music, art, and literature, allowing future generations to appreciate and learn from them. Moreover, technology can facilitate the documentation and preservation of cultural heritage sites and historical artifacts, ensuring their longevity for years to come.In conclusion, while technology does pose some threats to traditional cultures, it is not inevitable that these two entities cannot coexist. In fact, technology can be a valuable ally in the preservation and promotion of traditional cultures. By embracing technology in a thoughtful and culturally sensitive manner, we can ensure that our cultural heritage is protected and passed on to future generations. Ultimately, the key to preserving traditional cultures in the face of technological advancements lies in striking a balance between progress and preservation.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;The issue of whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject has sparked a contentious debate. While some argue that equal representation is essential for promoting gender equality, I partially agree with this stance, but also acknowledge that there are limitations to its feasibility.On one hand, having equal numbers of male and female students in every subject can help bridge the existing gender gap in various fields. For instance, historically, male-dominated subjects like engineering and computer science have seen a significant lack of female representation. By actively promoting equal enrollment, universities can encourage more women to pursue careers in these fields, thus fostering a more inclusive and diverse learning environment. Additionally, equal representation can help break down stereotypes and biases that may discourage women from pursuing certain subjects.On the other hand, implementing equal quotas for every subject may not be feasible or practical. Some subjects, such as nursing and education, have traditionally seen higher female enrollment, while others, like physics and mathematics, have seen higher male enrollment. Artificially manipulating the numbers to achieve equality could lead to less qualified candidates being accepted, potentially compromising the academic standards of the institution. Moreover, it may also overlook individual preferences and aptitudes, as students may not be suited for certain subjects regardless of their gender.In conclusion, while promoting equal representation is crucial for breaking down gender barriers, universities should not rigidly adhere to equal quotas for every subject. Instead, they should focus on creating inclusive and supportive environments that encourage students of all genders to pursue their desired fields, while also providing resources and opportunities to address any existing disparities. By doing so, universities can foster a more balanced and equitable learning environment without compromising academic standards.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;The Impact of Celebrity Media Coverage on ChildrenThe media's extensive coverage of celebrities has become an integral part of modern entertainment, with many young viewers drawn to the glamour and excitement of the celebrity world. However, there is a growing concern that this coverage may be having a negative impact on children. In this essay, I will examine the extent to which I agree with this opinion.On the one hand, I believe that excessive media coverage of celebrities can have a detrimental effect on children. Young viewers may be exposed to unsuitable content, such as explicit language, violence, or provocative behavior, which can be detrimental to their emotional and psychological well-being. Furthermore, the media's focus on celebrities' physical appearance and material possessions can create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism among children. For instance, the constant bombardment of images showcasing perfect bodies and luxurious lifestyles can lead to body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and a distorted view of what is truly important in life.On the other hand, I also think that celebrity media coverage can have positive effects on children. Inspiring stories of celebrities' charitable work, perseverance, and dedication to their craft can motivate young viewers to pursue their passions and make a positive difference in the world. For example, celebrities like Malala Yousafzai, who advocate for girls' education, can serve as role models and encourage children to value the importance of education and social responsibility.In conclusion, while I agree that media coverage of celebrities can have negative effects on children, I also believe that it can have positive influences. Ultimately, it is up to parents, caregivers, and the media to ensure that children are exposed to responsible and balanced celebrity coverage that promotes positive values and behaviors.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The adage ""prevention is better than cure"" underscores the importance of investing in health education and preventative measures to mitigate the burden of disease. While treatment is essential, I agree that a significant proportion of a country's health budget should be allocated towards preventative measures.Diverting funds from treatment to health education and preventative measures can have a significant impact on public health. For instance, initiatives such as vaccination programs, health screenings, and education campaigns can prevent the onset of diseases, reducing the need for costly treatments. Furthermore, investing in preventative measures can also reduce the economic burden of healthcare, as it is often more cost-effective to prevent illnesses than to treat them.Moreover, health education is crucial in empowering individuals to make informed choices about their health. By educating the public on healthy behaviors, nutrition, and lifestyle choices, governments can promote a culture of wellness and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. This approach can also help to reduce health inequities, as disadvantaged communities often bear the brunt of preventable illnesses.However, it is also important to acknowledge that treatment is still a critical component of healthcare. Hospitals and healthcare systems must be adequately funded to provide essential medical services, particularly for acute and emergency care. A balanced approach is necessary, where both prevention and treatment are prioritized.In conclusion, while treatment is essential, I firmly believe that a significant proportion of a country's health budget should be allocated towards health education and preventative measures. By doing so, governments can reduce the burden of disease, promote a culture of wellness, and ultimately, improve the health and wellbeing of their citizens."
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;The notion that women are solely responsible for childcare is a long-standing stereotype that has been perpetuated by societal norms and expectations. While motherhood has traditionally been celebrated and emphasized, fatherhood has often been relegated to the sidelines. However, I strongly believe that fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood, as the role of fathers in childcare is equally crucial.Firstly, research has shown that involved fathers have a significant impact on their children's cognitive, emotional, and social development. Fathers who take an active role in childcare can provide a unique perspective and set of skills that complement those of mothers. Moreover, children who have involved fathers tend to have better educational outcomes, social skills, and emotional well-being. By emphasizing fatherhood, we can encourage more fathers to take an active role in their children's lives, leading to better outcomes for children.Furthermore, the idea that women are solely responsible for childcare is not only unfair but also unrealistic. In today's society, many women work outside the home and have careers, just like men. It is unfair to expect them to shoulder the entire burden of childcare without the support and involvement of their partners. By emphasizing fatherhood, we can promote a more balanced and equitable approach to childcare, where both parents share the responsibilities and joys of raising their children.In conclusion, while the idea that women are solely responsible for childcare has been perpetuated by societal norms, I firmly believe that fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. By doing so, we can promote a more balanced approach to childcare, where both parents are involved and responsible for the upbringing of their children. This, in turn, can lead to better outcomes for children and a more equitable distribution of childcare responsibilities between men and women.
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.;"The statement that ""it is important that children should study hard at school"" is a widely accepted notion. However, the notion that ""time spent playing sport is time wasted"" is a highly debatable claim. In my opinion, I disagree with the latter part of the statement.While it is true that academic performance is crucial for a child's future success, it is also important to recognize the numerous benefits of sports and physical activities. Playing sports can improve a child's physical health, boost their self-esteem, and develop valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. These skills are essential for a child's overall development and can complement their academic performance.Moreover, research has shown that children who engage in sports tend to perform better academically than those who do not. This is because sports can improve cognitive function, enhance focus, and increase motivation. Furthermore, sports can provide a much-needed break from the rigors of academic study, allowing children to recharge and return to their studies with renewed energy and enthusiasm.It is also worth noting that the idea that time spent playing sport is time wasted is a narrow and misguided view. In reality, sports and physical activities can be an integral part of a child's education, teaching them valuable life lessons and skills that cannot be learned in a classroom.In conclusion, while it is indeed important for children to study hard at school, it is equally important to recognize the value of sports and physical activities in their overall development. Rather than viewing sports as a waste of time, we should be encouraging children to engage in sports and other extracurricular activities to promote their overall well-being and success."
