0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;It is commonly believed that competition plays a crucial role in advancing economic development. To thrive in a competitive environment, companies constantly enhance their products and services, leading to broader societal prosperity. However, when we consider the concepts of competition versus cooperation, our primary concern often shifts from society at large to the individual’s personal growth throughout their life. From this perspective, I strongly advocate for placing greater emphasis on cooperation in primary education.First and foremost, cooperation helps children develop essential interpersonal skills that are vital for their future. Through teamwork, they not only learn to pursue shared goals but also, more importantly, how to build and maintain positive relationships with others. The process of collaborating teaches children to listen to differing viewpoints, communicate effectively, think critically, and even find compromises during conflicts. These skills will serve them well throughout their lives.Conversely, the emphasis of competition lies in striving for excellence in order to achieve victory. While it is often said that competition enhances societal effectiveness, an examination of how to succeed reveals the necessity of cooperation. The larger the goal, the more cooperation is needed. For instance, consider the Olympic Games—a highly competitive arena. It is difficult to imagine an athlete succeeding without the rigorous training provided by a coach, as well as the support from professionals who manage nutrition and medical care. While the athlete ultimately stands as the winner, the triumph is a result of collective teamwork. Without cooperation, competition would not lead to success.In conclusion, whether we focus on individual development or the interplay between competition and cooperation, it is clear that fostering a cooperative mindset is far more beneficial for achieving personal success.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;Over the past 50 years, there has been a notable increase in the number of immigrants moving to various countries. Many individuals have relocated in search of better educational opportunities and higher-paying jobs. Some believe that to integrate into their new cultures, they should adopt local customs. However, I firmly believe that immigrants can maintain their cultural identities, and doing so not only preserves their original values but also enriches their new communities.First and foremost, preserving one’s cultural identity is essential for helping individuals navigate multicultural environments. For instance, in Australia, immigrants from diverse backgrounds celebrate Multicultural Day, where they showcase their traditional foods and activities in public spaces. Many Australians attend this event to enjoy the performances, learn about different cultures, and appreciate the richness of diversity. Such interactions foster pride in one’s heritage and promote understanding among various communities, highlighting the importance of sustaining the cultural values of immigrants.Additionally, it is vital for individuals to retain their cultural identity as a way to connect with their homeland and to instill these values in their children. Immigrant children adapting to a new country often face social challenges in schools while trying to make friends. In these situations, it can be beneficial for parents to seek out friendships with others from their home country, providing their children with a sense of familiarity that helps them feel at home. Lacking this sense of connection can lead to feelings of isolation, which in severe cases, might contribute to social issues such as autism. Thus, it is evident that maintaining cultural traditions in their host countries is incredibly important.In conclusion, while some argue that one must abandon their cultural values to assimilate into a new society, I believe that preserving these traditions allows immigrants to retain their cultural identities and helps foster confidence in a multicultural environment.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;Over the past decade, there has been a notable rise in the number of tourists exploring natural wonders, ancient heritage sites, and diverse cultures worldwide. While some may argue that international tourism negatively impacts host countries, I believe it significantly contributes to economic growth as well as cultural and environmental preservation.Firstly, international tourism boosts various sectors of the economy in destination countries to meet the diverse needs of travelers. For example, Cambodia attracts numerous visitors to the Angkor Wat temple, leading to a demand for services such as restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops, and more. This demand stimulates local businesses, creating jobs and enhancing infrastructure and living standards. As a result, tourism has undeniably improved the quality of life in these regions.Secondly, the tourism industry plays a crucial role in preserving cultural values and protecting natural environments. In Vietnam, for instance, traditional performances like the ‘Trong Dong’ drum show and scenic sites like ‘Ha Long’ Bay receive encouragement and funding from the tourism ministry for their preservation. Without the financial support and awareness generated by tourism, many traditional practices could fade away due to a lack of income. Therefore, tourism helps sustain numerous intangible cultural heritages and breathtaking landscapes.In conclusion, I firmly believe that international tourism has not only driven economic development but also helped maintain the cultural and environmental integrity of host countries. Furthermore, it is essential for authorities to provide adequate support for these sustainable initiatives.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;"Over the past 50 years, there has been a notable surge in global tourism. While some may argue that this influx of travelers brings substantial profit to host countries, I believe that the tourism industry has adversely affected both cultural identities and the natural environment of these destinations.Firstly, it is clear that an influx of tourists from diverse cultures can alter the cultural identity of the areas they visit. For instance, during the Vietnam War, many American soldiers traveled to Thailand for leisure, engaging in activities related to sex and drugs. This surge in demand led to the rise and expansion of local businesses, some of which operated illegally, even involving underage prostitution to maximize gains. The lack of effective oversight by authorities contributed to a tarnished reputation for Thailand’s tourism industry. This illustrates how international tourism can result in negative consequences for host nations.Secondly, there is significant evidence that tourism inflicts harm on the natural habitats of popular destinations. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia serves as a prime example; millions of visitors each year have caused substantial damage to this natural wonder, including coral breakage from foot traffic and boat anchors, as well as pollution from fuel and other waste. Consequently, many marine species are now at risk, with certain areas of the reef becoming uninhabitable. It is evident that tourism poses a threat to natural environments.In conclusion, I firmly believe that tourism places significant pressure on both sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities fail to implement adequate conservation measures for these invaluable resources, they risk being irrevocably damaged in the near future."
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;Every student aspires to attend a reputable university and immerse themselves in a new environment. While some students choose to study and live abroad to achieve this goal, others prefer to remain at home due to the challenges associated with overseas living and studying. In my view, studying abroad offers numerous benefits, equipping individuals with valuable skills for several reasons.Firstly, attending a university overseas allows students to enhance their social skills by engaging with peers from diverse backgrounds and cultures. Those studying abroad are often better equipped to adapt to new environments and situations than their counterparts who remain in their home country.Secondly, living and studying in a foreign country provides an invaluable experience for developing independence. While students may initially face the challenges of loneliness and separation from family and friends, these struggles ultimately foster resilience and self-reliance, teaching them to stand on their own.Additionally, employers are increasingly seeking candidates with international experience and language proficiency. Successfully completing studies abroad can give students a competitive advantage in the job market, making them more attractive candidates compared to their peers.In conclusion, students may encounter various challenges while studying and living overseas. However, this experience broadens their perspectives not only on their academic subjects but also on life in general.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;"Studying abroad is a prevalent choice among students, each with their own motivations. I believe that this experience offers numerous benefits, allowing students to grow personally, academically, and culturally.Firstly, students who study in foreign countries gain invaluable life experiences. Adapting to a new environment demands considerable flexibility and resilience. For instance, they may encounter various challenges while adjusting to their host country, which necessitates effective problem-solving skills. Navigating these obstacles fosters maturity and independence in students.Another significant advantage is the distinct academic experience available at their chosen institution. Students are exposed to different educational systems, meet diverse professors, and collaborate with new peers, making their academic journey uniquely different from that of their home country.Most importantly, the cultural exposure provided by living abroad cannot be overstated. Immersed in a foreign culture, students have the opportunity to learn about local traditions, customs, and ways of thinking. Engaging with people from different backgrounds broadens their perspectives, enhances open-mindedness, and encourages acceptance of diverse ideas. This cultural education is vital, as it deepens their understanding of the world around them.In conclusion, studying abroad offers far more than academic benefits; it can profoundly impact students in various areas of life, shaping them in positive ways."
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The internet has become increasingly popular in recent years, offering an unparalleled source of information. Consequently, traditional print media, like newspapers, has seen a significant decline in readership. While some individuals still believe newspapers can endure for the long term, others argue they have lost their competitive edge for survival. Personally, I align with the latter perspective for several reasons.To begin with, accessing information online is faster and more convenient than perusing newspapers. In the past, people often had to wait hours for their daily paper, but now, with mobile phones and computers connected to the internet, they can receive real-time news updates at any time and from anywhere. These devices have become ubiquitous around the globe, allowing users to easily access a wealth of information that newspapers simply cannot match within their limited pages. As a result, print media has struggled to maintain its relevance as a key source of information.Furthermore, from an economic standpoint, purchasing newspapers seems impractical when the internet is so widely accessible. It is evident that internet services are often available at low cost or even free in many regions. This raises the question: why would an individual pay for newspapers that typically provide less content than what can be found online? The logical conclusion is that few rational individuals would choose to do so, which may continue to drive down newspaper readership and potentially lead to the closure of numerous publications in the future.Lastly, the environmental impact of newspaper production cannot be overlooked. Increasing newspaper production means more trees are being cut down, contributing to deforestation—a significant issue affecting our planet today. As such, the continued publication of newspapers will inevitably face opposition from environmental advocates.In conclusion, while the decline of newspapers may be disheartening for those who support traditional media, it should be viewed as a natural outcome of the relentless advancements in media technology and the evolving dynamics of modern life.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";"As Senator Bernie Sanders pointed out, ""Education is an investment in our future."" It plays a crucial role in fostering a civilized society and contributes significantly to a nation's long-term prosperity. It's no surprise that governments around the globe prioritize educational development. When it comes to the two vital components of the education system—elementary and higher education—governments must provide adequate financial support for both.Elementary education serves as the foundation for becoming a responsible citizen in today's world, much like the base of a structure. Therefore, it is essential for governments to ensure that everyone has equal and easy access to this fundamental level of education. A lack of solid primary education often correlates with high illiteracy rates, jeopardizing a country's future growth. For developing nations, especially, prioritizing elementary education is key to cultivating a more educated populace.However, focusing solely on elementary education is insufficient. Higher education represents the forefront of a country's academic accomplishments and is pivotal for economic and social progress. The application of advanced technologies and innovative ideas not only fosters national development but also enhances a country's standing on the global stage. While some may argue that universities can sustain themselves through donations or funding, this perspective overlooks the reality that research in the humanities and arts requires significant financial resources. Moreover, substantial government investment in universities can attract top intellectuals and researchers, increasing the nation's prestige internationally.In conclusion, it is clear that governments must invest in both primary and higher education, as both are essential to achieving a brighter future."
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";"There has been considerable discussion about the significance of having good roommates and the impact they can have on our school experience. Research indicates that friendships formed in university, particularly with roommates, are more likely to last a lifetime. In my view, one of the most important qualities of a roommate is thoughtfulness. Additionally, effective communication plays a key role in fostering a positive roommate dynamic.Thoughtfulness is essential in any relationship. For instance, a considerate roommate might lower the music or television volume during the night. Often, we don’t realize the effect of our actions until we encounter similar behavior from others. By consistently considering the feelings of others before engaging in self-centered behavior, we can greatly enhance our roommate relationship. Therefore, having a considerate roommate is crucial for our time in school, as it helps prevent conflicts and can lead to a lasting friendship or even a familial bond.Furthermore, communication is vital in ensuring a harmonious living arrangement. Everyone has different habits, such as making the bed in the morning. What might seem like a simple task to one person could feel overwhelming to another. If someone chooses to move out simply because their roommate doesn’t make their bed, they may be regretting a rash decision later. Open communication can clarify misunderstandings, build connections, and foster a better understanding between roommates.In conclusion, there are many important attributes to consider in a roommate, but I believe that thoughtfulness and communication are the most critical qualities. However, it's important to recognize that we may not always find the ideal match; the world is filled with diverse personalities. Being adaptable and flexible is essential for navigating relationships in society."
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;Transportation has become a significant topic of social concern today. The debate over whether governments should allocate more funding to traffic infrastructure or prioritize the development of public transportation continues to spark controversy. It is reasonable to argue that governments should invest more in buses, trains, and subways, as these public modes of transport can serve large numbers of people, helping to reduce traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions—both of which are crucial issues.First and foremost, reducing carbon emissions is essential for safeguarding the environment. The reality is that the greater the number of cars and motorcycles on the roads, the more severe the damage to the ozone layer becomes. If governments focus their funding on expanding road networks, it is likely that more people will choose to drive their personal vehicles to work, resulting in increased carbon emissions that can contribute to skin cancer and environmental degradation. Conversely, enhancing the quality and availability of buses, trains, and subways encourages people to rely less on their private vehicles, thus decreasing carbon output. Clearly, prioritizing funding for public transportation has a positive impact on the planet.Moreover, this funding strategy is crucial for alleviating traffic congestion. Traffic jams are a significant issue in many major cities, primarily due to the excessive number of vehicles on the roads. To effectively address this challenge, governments need to shift public focus toward public transportation in order to reduce the reliance on cars and motorcycles. Simply improving roads and highways may not effectively address the root cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, while it is true that well-maintained roads and highways facilitate easier movement, public transportation systems offer even more critical benefits. They not only help ease traffic congestion but also contribute to environmental preservation. This is why numerous governments worldwide are choosing to channel more resources into developing public transportation infrastructure.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";"While some may argue that the majority of the school schedule should focus solely on academic subjects, I firmly believe that physical education is equally important and should not be overlooked. Engaging in physical activities contributes to the overall health of the nation, enhances learning through experiential observation, and can even stimulate a country’s economic growth.Firstly, the ancient Latin saying ""Anima sana in corpore sano"" emphasizes the idea that a healthy body is the foundation for a healthy mind. There is a clear connection between physical health and the regular practice of exercise; the more we engage in physical activities, the better we feel. Moreover, regular exercise can lead to significant improvements in health over time. If an entire nation starts to prioritize sports and physical activities from a young age, it could ultimately foster a healthier society.In addition, participating in both outdoor and indoor sports can clarify many concepts. For instance, an individual who jogs regularly develops a deeper understanding of their body through firsthand experience. Similarly, a school basketball team learns more about effective shooting techniques through practice rather than just theoretical lessons. Moreover, many breakthroughs in natural sciences have come from direct observation, which is integral to physical education.Furthermore, the financial stability of a region is often linked to the health of its population. Investment in physical education programs can reduce healthcare costs because a healthier populace requires less medical intervention. Additionally, physically fit individuals tend to make greater contributions to both economic and social development. In essence, when individuals feel better physically, their cognitive function improves, leading to a more mentally healthy society and, consequently, a more economically competitive nation.In conclusion, prioritizing physical education not only benefits students’ overall well-being but also positively influences their academic performance. The more emphasis we place on the importance of physical activity, the greater the impact on the academic success of our students."

Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.;In today's world, the impact of technology on our lives is evident, particularly in transportation and communication, with innovations like airplanes and telephones leading the way. There are numerous other ways that advancing technology has influenced these areas, as outlined below. Firstly, email stands out as one of the most significant benefits of modern technology. In the past, people incurred high costs to send letters, with fees based on weight and the constant risk of delivery issues due to accidents. Today, however, everyone can access the internet to create free email accounts, allowing them to send messages instantly while also confirming their delivery status.Another crucial technological advancement is in financial transactions. Students now find it much easier to apply to foreign universities, not only through email but also by using credit cards to pay necessary fees online. The rise of the internet and online payment systems has made many tasks accessible from the comfort of home.Additionally, advancements in medical equipment have greatly benefited people worldwide. Biomedical engineers have significantly contributed to increasing life expectancy. For instance, one notable innovation is the development of artificial heart valves, which have revolutionized heart surgery. In the past, doctors relied on pig heart valves for transplants, but patients often survived only a few years afterwards. Today, the creation of artificial heart valves allows for safer and more effective surgeries, greatly improving patient outcomes.In conclusion, technology has made our lives more comfortable and convenient, with noticeable effects in transportation, communication, medicine, and beyond.
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;Technology significantly accelerates the pace of human evolution. Thanks to advanced innovations, many once-unimaginable concepts have become tangible realities. For instance, in the past, people could only dream of communicating anytime they wished or seeing someone from afar via a computer screen—capabilities that are now made possible by cell phones and the internet. However, some argue that technology has stifled children's creativity. While I acknowledge that technology can have some detrimental effects on children, I believe it, in fact, fosters even greater creativity.First, technology serves as a source of inspiration for children to invent new things. Children, by nature, are curious about their surroundings. When they encounter high-tech gadgets like cell phones, they become fascinated by their intricate functionalities and are motivated to understand how they operate. For example, Bill Gates was captivated by the first large computers and dedicated himself to learning their workings. Once he grasped the underlying principles, he began to promote the computer, ultimately creating a user-friendly and lightweight version. Thus, rather than hindering creativity, technology actively encourages children to explore, learn, and innovate.Second, technology broadens children’s horizons. In the past, children often viewed the world through a limited lens. Today, however, advanced technology allows them to access information from around the globe and connect with friends from different cultures. This exposure helps them learn about diverse perspectives and ways of thinking. Knowledge is the foundation of creativity, and the varied insights children gain from around the world inspire them to create new ideas and solutions.It is true that technology can have negative impacts on children. Modern conveniences might make life too easy, leading some kids to become complacent and indifferent to the world around them. Nevertheless, with the rapid advancement of technology, an increasing number of young people are becoming passionate about high-tech innovations. They pursue research in emerging technologies and achieve remarkable success at a young age.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;Over the past fifty years, the transformation in human life has surpassed our most ambitious expectations. An abundance of new technological devices, such as the Internet, television, and mobile phones, has permeated our daily existence, enhancing our experiences. Many students now utilize the Internet for additional learning outside of school, finding it to be quite beneficial.However, numerous individuals assert that students in schools and universities gain far more from interacting with teachers. They argue that educators play a crucial role in teaching fundamental skills like reading, writing, and mathematics from kindergarten onward. In primary school, teachers further develop students’ knowledge by enhancing their writing skills and computer literacy. Teachers also assist students in overcoming challenges in their educational journey, helping them distinguish between right and wrong.Conversely, some believe that students acquire a significant amount of knowledge from alternative sources like the Internet and television. They argue that students can quickly find vast amounts of information by simply entering a few keywords into a search engine, leading them to a wealth of articles and websites. Furthermore, they suggest that quality television programs, such as those on the Discovery Channel, provide valuable insights into various cultures, outer space, and more.In my opinion, students learn much more from their teachers than from other resources. Teachers not only impart knowledge but also instill the critical skills necessary for discerning right from wrong. Consider this: if a student is unable to evaluate the credibility of a source, how can they expect to obtain accurate information that aids their learning?
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;The advent of email and text messaging has significantly transformed the way we communicate. This shift has led some to argue that these new forms of communication may undermine the integrity of written language. I support this viewpoint, given the advantages of these technologies and their current prevalence.Firstly, it’s clear that email and text messaging offer numerous benefits, which explain their widespread adoption. In the past, communication relied on direct interactions, sending letters, or making calls from landlines, all of which often posed challenges such as high costs, difficulties with long-distance communication, and the potential for lost messages. In contrast, email and mobile phones have resolved many of these issues. People can now send and receive electronic messages at any location and at any time. The functions of email and SMS have made it cheaper and faster to convey large amounts of information, even to multiple recipients simultaneously. Their convenience has led to a preference for these methods over traditional communication.However, this growing reliance on email and text messaging has contributed to a decline in the status of written language. Many users resort to slang and abbreviations to expedite their writing, which alters the original form of the language. In some cases, messages are even composed entirely of emoticons, leaving no room for traditional writing. This trend is particularly concerning among young people, who sometimes incorporate this new language into their academic work and assignments. If this trend continues to accelerate, we may face serious challenges regarding the preservation of written language.In conclusion, we cannot overlook the potential threat posed by email and text messaging to the status of written language due to their clear popularity. It is essential for educators and individuals, particularly the younger generation, to pay closer attention to this issue. By doing so, we can embrace the advantages of these new communication methods while also safeguarding our traditional written language.
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";As living standards continue to rise rapidly, the number of animal experiments being conducted has also increased, particularly for new medicines and foods. While some critics argue that these practices are cruel to animals and detrimental to nature, I contend that no reasonable person can deny the severe risks to humanity if new foods and medications are allowed to enter the market without prior animal testing. In this essay, I will explore this issue from two perspectives.Firstly, it is widely acknowledged that animals play a crucial role in our ecosystem. Their absence would disrupt the balance of nature, jeopardizing human survival as well. However, the conduct of animal experiments can contribute to the decline of certain animal species. In essence, such testing poses a threat not only to specific animal populations but also to the future well-being of humanity.Despite the negative impacts that animal testing may have on ecological balance, it is essential for ensuring human longevity. It is undeniable that new foods and medications can have harmful effects, and scientists must take necessary precautions to confirm that these innovations enhance human health rather than endanger it. The purpose of developing new foods and medicines is to improve the quality of human life. Therefore, even if volunteers are available for testing, they cannot substitute for animals in this critical process. Additionally, without proper testing, there is a significant risk to human health.In conclusion, while there are certain downsides to animal testing, I maintain that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;"Finding a home without a television is quite rare these days. The number of television channels and programs continues to grow daily. Sadly, many people lack a plan to limit or schedule their TV watching. I believe that television can harm family bonds.Although watching TV can be enjoyable, it is also extremely time-consuming. The proliferation of new channels and shows is no surprise; we often waste our time flipping through channels, only to realize it’s too late to engage in other activities by day’s end. This dilemma affects us all, leaving little time for important connections, such as calling our parents or friends.Moreover, I think that television promotes laziness. After an eight-hour workday, we often find ourselves spending at least three hours in front of the screen. Consequently, we neglect healthy activities like going to the gym or participating in sports. This leads to a sedentary lifestyle and a preference for passive entertainment over more active and social pursuits.Additionally, some television programs can have a detrimental impact on viewers. Certain action and thriller movies often glamorize negative behaviors, such as criminal activity. This is particularly concerning for teenagers, who may emulate what they see on screen in their everyday lives.In conclusion, wasting time, fostering laziness, and promoting negative behavior are just a few reasons why television can be damaging. Addressing this issue requires a collective global effort to find solutions."
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;In today’s world, both men and women actively participate in all areas of work and life. In contrast, in the past, women were primarily confined to domestic roles, often engaging in intricate tasks within the home. This historical perspective still influences the views of many, leading them to believe that women should stick to such roles in contemporary society. This mindset sometimes drives universities to admit students based on gender rather than merit.It is essential for universities to maintain an equal enrollment of male and female students. Women have consistently demonstrated their capabilities across various fields, both indoors and outdoors. For instance, women are successfully managing households while also taking to the skies as pilots. Additionally, university administrations must avoid gender bias in their admission processes and instead focus on the academic achievements of applicants.Nevertheless, the current job market can influence university decisions. Many institutions tailor their programs to meet the demands of employers, who often have pre-defined hiring criteria. For example, some employers tend to seek male candidates for physically demanding roles, such as machinery repair and heavy installations, and may prefer men for night shifts. Meanwhile, roles that are perceived as gentler, like counseling, teaching, and design, are often filled by women. Consequently, universities might align their programs with employers’ preferences based on gender.In conclusion, I firmly believe that universities should allow all individuals the freedom to choose their fields of study. Today's youth are more confident about their career choices and are unwilling to be limited by traditional gender roles. Female candidates, in particular, are increasingly disregarding societal and employer-imposed restrictions. Therefore, it is crucial to provide them with the opportunities they need to achieve their goals.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;Many young adults are eager to move out of their parents' homes in pursuit of independence and freedom. However, they often overlook the challenges that come with living on their own. Once they leave home, they face the responsibility of managing numerous bills, including rent, utilities, and groceries, which can add up quickly. To minimize expenses, they may need to find a roommate, who might not align with their preferences or lifestyle.Living independently can be financially burdensome for young adults. They must handle loan repayments, utilities, and basic living costs all on their own. For those who are still in school, balancing studies with work becomes essential to make ends meet. In contrast, living at home can significantly ease their financial strain, as parents often provide support that allows their children to focus solely on their education.Another potential downside of living away from home is the challenge of finding a compatible roommate. Disparate habits and behaviors can create tension, and young adults may find themselves uncomfortable in their shared living situation. If they do not share common interests or viewpoints, it can lead to constant disagreements rather than a supportive environment.In summary, I believe it’s more advantageous for young adults to live with their parents. This arrangement allows them to avoid financial stress and roommate conflicts, providing a more stable foundation as they transition into adulthood.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;Air pollution poses a significant threat to the environment in various ways, including depleting the ozone layer and exacerbating global warming. I believe that greater accountability should be placed on both individuals and companies, particularly in the form of financial contributions to address air pollution.Firstly, many industrialized nations host a plethora of companies operating large factories. The waste and toxic emissions generated by these facilities contribute substantially to air pollution. While these corporations often profit immensely from their operations, many fail to implement measures to mitigate their environmental impact. If these companies were required to pay for air pollution cleanup, it would incentivize them to take meaningful steps to reduce their emissions.Secondly, private individuals also contribute to air pollution through unnecessary car usage and inadequate home heating practices. Although heating is vital during winter, some households neglect to use filters to minimize pollution from heating systems. Furthermore, the operation of high-emission vehicles significantly worsens the problem. I believe that imposing fees on individuals for their pollution contributions would help diminish overall air quality issues.However, I also contend that governments should impose restrictions on products that generate air pollution for both companies and individuals. Additionally, governments should allocate a portion of their budget toward cleaning the air rather than placing the entire burden on companies and citizens.In conclusion, while it is the government's responsibility to ensure a healthy environment for its citizens and manage air pollution cleanup, both companies and private individuals must play a significant role in addressing this pressing issue.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;"Every day, companies present a vast array of products to consumers, and the most effective way to encourage these consumers to make a purchase is through advertising. However, advertising alone is not enough; the product must also meet consumer needs. In my view, advertising plays a crucial role in driving product sales for several reasons.Firstly, advertisements are often how we first learn about products. Advertisers go to great lengths to creatively entice consumers to buy their products. When consumers are captivated by an advertisement, they may come to see the product as a necessity. For example, a recent television ad for a soft drink cleverly portrays it as the ultimate refreshment for hot weather, which inevitably boosts its sales.Additionally, the more frequently a product is advertised in the media, the more popular it tends to become. Advertisements are instrumental in establishing a product’s brand recognition. Consumers are likely to choose the most recognized product when faced with a choice between two similar brands. A product that is widely adopted creates a sense of trust within society, regardless of its actual quality. However, it is crucial that the product remains affordable for consumers; only then can advertising significantly influence their preferences.In conclusion, while I believe that consumers should prioritize essential needs when making purchases, the correlation between high sales and the effectiveness of advertising is undeniably strong."
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";"The ongoing debate about the value of university education for young people is very relevant today. Some believe that obtaining a high-quality education at university is crucial for the country's progress, while others argue it contributes to rising unemployment rates. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives to reach an informed conclusion.Proponents of forgoing university education present several arguments. They contend that there are ample job opportunities available for those without a university degree, including positions in fields such as mechanics, sales, and engineering. Moreover, they point out that there is often an oversupply of graduates relative to available roles, creating a competitive job market for highly educated individuals. This competition can lead to inefficient use of national resources, as young people might waste valuable time pursuing high-paying jobs that are hard to secure.Conversely, advocates for university education emphasize its multifaceted benefits. Universities not only equip students with career-specific skills but also provide essential academic knowledge in areas like biosciences, politics, and medicine. These contributions are vital for societal advancement. Furthermore, significant breakthroughs and innovations have emerged from academic research, which has enhanced modern society. Additionally, university life offers diverse experiences that can better prepare young adults. Internships, stimulating discussions, independence, and study-abroad opportunities foster personal and professional growth.In conclusion, both sides of the university education debate offer valid arguments; however, I align with the latter perspective. While a college degree does not guarantee success, the advantages of university education play a crucial role in expanding opportunities for societal development, nurturing academic progress, and assisting the younger generation in facing various challenges."
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;In today's world, the widespread use of mobile phones has undoubtedly brought significant convenience, but it has also introduced various challenges, including social, health, and technical issues. Despite these drawbacks, I believe that the advantages of mobile phones far outweigh their disadvantages. In this essay, I will explore these three concerns to support my argument.To begin with, any advancement that significantly alters our way of life often comes with social repercussions, and mobile phones are no exception. For instance, speaking loudly on the phone in public spaces like schools, libraries, and hospitals is generally considered rude and disruptive. Additionally, some students misuse their phones as tools for cheating during exams, sending and receiving answers via text. However, these issues can be addressed through the effective implementation of regulations and guidelines.Health-related concerns also merit attention, as excessive use of electronic devices, including mobile phones, may have serious consequences. Research suggests that prolonged use can increase the risk of hearing loss and certain types of cancer, although further studies are warranted to fully understand these risks.Another contentious issue centers around technology and privacy. Many people fear that their conversations may be intercepted by others, which is indeed a valid concern. Nonetheless, there is potential for the development of more efficient and secure systems to better protect user privacy.Furthermore, mobile phones have become essential multifunctional tools in our daily lives. They serve not only as communication devices but also as internet browsers, music players, personal organizers, and much more.In conclusion, while every tool has its side effects when overused, the impact of mobile phones on modern society is significant, and society's reliance on them is unlikely to diminish. Although there are several challenges associated with their use, these can be effectively managed.
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;In today's world, the advancement of technology has made computers an essential part of our lives. While some individuals believe that children should use computers daily as they offer benefits, others hold a contrasting viewpoint. Personally, I align with the latter perspective.Firstly, excessive computer use can harm children's eyesight. Prolonged concentration on screens can lead to eye strain, which is a significant contributor to vision issues, particularly nearsightedness.Additionally, children who are overly immersed in computer games may develop poor communication skills and become disconnected from real-world experiences. It's well-documented that individuals addicted to gaming, especially online games, can face severe repercussions. A tragic example is the case of a Korean gamer who played continuously for three days, ultimately leading to health complications and his untimely death.Moreover, even those who aren’t fans of online gaming can experience negative effects from excessive computer use. Various social studies indicate that while some children claim to use computers for educational purposes, many are instead drawn to social media platforms like Facebook and blogs. This distraction can result in poor academic performance, as children who cannot disconnect from the internet subsequently struggle to find time for their studies.In conclusion, while it's undeniable that computers play a vital role in modern life, they also pose significant risks, particularly for young users. It is crucial for individuals to learn how to engage with technology responsibly, ensuring that computers serve as effective tools for productivity and education, rather than mere sources of entertainment.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;The question of whether to construct large factories near residential areas has become a contentious issue in today’s society. Industrial facilities are essential for economic growth and are a crucial component of modern life. However, a significant number of individuals oppose the establishment of factories in their neighborhoods due to concerns about pollution. In my opinion, the benefits of constructing a factory can surpass its drawbacks, provided we address the environmental challenges associated with such developments.First and foremost, a large factory can drive local economic development and help reduce unemployment. The production of goods necessitates a workforce, which allows local residents to benefit from job opportunities. Additionally, factories often lead to the establishment of related industries and businesses, fostering economic growth in the surrounding area. For instance, the real estate sector may thrive to accommodate the housing needs of factory workers.The primary concern, however, is pollution. It is undeniable that some regions experience severe repercussions from unchecked industrial growth, including water contamination, increased traffic congestion, and public health issues. In certain industrial cities, many workers suffer from respiratory ailments, such as asthma, often linked to toxic emissions and chemical byproducts.Nevertheless, as society progresses, the construction of more factories seems unavoidable. Therefore, improving the challenges posed by factory operations is more critical than debating their existence. In fact, many environmental issues can be mitigated if factories genuinely commit to effective waste management practices.In conclusion, the establishment of manufacturing plants is a significant trend in the industrialization process of many countries. Their advantages can outweigh the disadvantages as long as factories are dedicated to properly managing waste and minimizing pollution.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;"In today's fast-paced society, an increasing number of individuals are opting for prepared meals as their everyday food choice, primarily to save time, which many equate to money. Nonetheless, it's clear that relying on prepared foods can have detrimental effects due to the use of artificial ingredients, neglecting nutritional needs, and altering traditional eating habits. In this essay, I will discuss why this trend is concerning, based on these three factors.To begin with, most manufacturers enhance the flavor and convenience of their products by incorporating a variety of artificial ingredients. However, many of these additives have been linked to serious health issues, as highlighted in numerous articles in newspapers and magazines that explore the connection between specific chemical substances in food and various diseases. Therefore, foods that are marketed as easy to prepare can pose risks to our health.Additionally, avoiding the preparation of fresh food can result in insufficient nutrition. While it's true that prepared meals require significantly less time to make, research has shown that these convenience foods often lack essential nutrients, particularly for growing children who need a balanced diet.Moreover, cooking is an art form that reflects our culture. As we consume more prepared meals, we may lose valuable cooking skills. In our fast-paced lives, many people rely heavily on microwaves to prepare dishes in just five minutes, often overlooking the fact that this reliance threatens to diminish our culinary traditions and customs.In conclusion, while prepared foods undeniably meet the needs of busy individuals, their prevalence is not without drawbacks. Cooking is not merely a time-consuming task; rather, it plays a vital role in fostering our health and preserving our cultural culinary heritage."
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;It is widely recognized that a growing divide exists between developed and developing countries. While some developed nations and organizations do provide financial assistance to poorer countries, this approach is not the most effective or sole solution for their challenges. A closer examination of the need for educational development and the true intentions of supporters will clarify this point.Firstly, education plays a crucial role in a country's development. Many developing nations lack essential educational resources, including experienced teachers, assessment frameworks, and adequate teaching facilities, often overlooked by local authorities. This illustrates that if developed countries refuse to share their successful educational strategies, poorer nations will struggle to progress, regardless of the financial aid they receive. Therefore, a more effective approach to improving the circumstances of these countries is to assist them in establishing comprehensive educational systems rather than just providing financial support.Moreover, it is commonly understood that nothing comes without a price. Some powerful nations offer financial aid with the ulterior motive of gaining access to local resources and influencing the labor market. In many cases, they do not provide technological assistance to local communities and can even contribute to environmental degradation in certain areas. Thus, developing countries should not rely solely on financial support from more powerful nations.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only means of supporting impoverished countries. Evidence shows that prioritizing education and enhancing national technological and scientific capabilities are vital steps toward meaningful change in their current situations.
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;"It is widely recognized that advertising has become an integral part of modern life. We encounter advertisements almost everywhere, every day. Some argue that businesses waste money promoting their goods or services, while others contend that advertisements serve no beneficial purpose and only harm society, calling for a complete ban on all forms of advertising. However, I propose a different approach: advertising is necessary, but it is imperative for us to regulate the content and the types of goods and services presented to consumers.Firstly, I fully endorse the notion that advertising for alcohol, tobacco, and products with adult content should be prohibited, as these types of ads can negatively impact our children. Young people may be tempted to purchase cigarettes or alcohol, leading to potential daily consumption. Thankfully, in some countries, this issue is taken seriously, and advertising related to alcohol, tobacco, and adult content is banned.On the other hand, advertising enables companies, businesses, and individuals to promote their products and services. Through advertisements, we gain awareness of new offerings, allowing us to compare and select the best options for ourselves.Today, not only businesses but also governments rely on advertising. For instance, tourism contributes significantly to the Czech Republic's economy, comprising one-third of it. To showcase the nation’s attractions, the Czech government must advertise and market its services to foreign tourists. Only with well-planned and targeted advertising can the country attract more visitors.In conclusion, I believe that modern society needs advertising. It keeps us informed about new products and services; however, we must also recognize that advertising for cigarettes and alcohol can have a detrimental impact on our children."
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;I believe that today’s married women have the right to pursue careers just like men, especially as gender-based employment discrimination has markedly decreased. Working outside the home offers numerous advantages for both married women and their families. Here are a few key reasons supporting this view.First and foremost, the additional income that women can earn significantly aids their families’ finances. By securing a job, a wife can provide extra financial support, which is particularly important in situations where her husband’s salary is low or when quality job opportunities are scarce. Therefore, it has become quite common for women to contribute financially.Additionally, working outside the home allows married women to engage with the outside world, build their self-esteem, and showcase their abilities. This interaction can foster greater confidence and independence. As a result, these women can serve as inspiring role models for their children, enhancing their effectiveness in both motherly and wifely roles.Finally, there are numerous resources available today that help women balance professional and domestic responsibilities. With government policies promoting smaller families and shared household duties from their husbands, many employers also provide part-time job options for women.In conclusion, a well-run household does not require the constant presence of a housewife, and married women should feel empowered to work and enjoy their professional lives outside the home.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";Primary and secondary education provide essential knowledge and skills to individuals around the world. I firmly believe that governments should fund these levels of education for their citizens. However, when it comes to higher education, such as university, the financial responsibility should fall on the students or their families.Some parents may struggle to afford their children's university tuition. Nevertheless, I believe it would be unfair to place this burden on the government, which has already invested significantly in primary and secondary education. Instead, it would be more beneficial for the government to allocate funds to support other educational needs, ensuring that all citizens have access to quality education.Moreover, students who have acquired basic knowledge can take on part-time jobs to help cover their tuition costs when their parents are unable to do so. This financial responsibility can foster a greater sense of accountability towards their studies. Additionally, managing their own educational expenses can promote independence and strengthen their character, preparing them for the workforce.This approach may also motivate parents to find ways to support their children's ambitions and contribute to their future success. In conclusion, I strongly advocate for the idea that the government should not bear the cost of university fees. By doing so, both parents and students will be encouraged to take charge of their futures, rather than relying solely on government support.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;In recent times, transportation has garnered significant attention. While some advocate for automobiles as the most convenient mode of travel, others argue that we should explore alternative forms of transport due to the environmental pollution caused by vehicles. I firmly believe that we need to implement alternative transportation options and establish international regulations to manage automobile usage. This essay will elaborate on several reasons supporting this viewpoint.To begin with, the rising number of automobiles significantly contributes to environmental pollution. Emissions from cars, including exhaust and carbon dioxide, negatively affect air quality, leading to respiratory issues among local residents. Therefore, it is essential to transition away from automobiles towards alternative forms of transportation and to enact legislation that regulates car use.Furthermore, the increase in automobiles leads to severe traffic congestion. Being stuck in traffic not only wastes time but also causes frustration among drivers, which can result in a higher incidence of accidents. Consequently, it is vital to devise and implement strategies that will reduce the number of vehicles on the road and regulate car ownership and usage.To address these issues, promoting alternative transportation methods and establishing international laws to regulate automobile ownership can be highly effective. Regarding alternative transportation, options that produce lower carbon emissions and pollutants than cars are ideal. For example, several European countries have introduced bike-sharing systems where bicycles are available for rent at various locations, allowing people to travel between districts for a small fee. Since bicycles do not emit carbon dioxide or harmful gases, they present a more environmentally friendly option compared to cars. On the regulatory side, implementing international laws could also be beneficial. For instance, regulations might limit car usage during certain hours or restrict households to one vehicle, thus helping to alleviate both traffic congestion and pollution.In conclusion, while some may argue in favor of the convenience of automobiles, I contend that promoting alternative transportation options and enacting international regulations to control automobile usage are essential for protecting the environment and reducing traffic congestion.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";"In today’s world, the concept of ""globalization"" is well-known, signifying an increasing interconnectedness among nations. Countries now influence one another more than ever before in various ways. This reality has led both governmental and non-governmental organizations to prioritize cooperation and aid for impoverished nations. While it’s true that assistance to these countries can sometimes be exploited by more powerful nations, and that substantial resources and funds can lead to corruption or political dependency, I believe that the positive impacts of assisting poorer countries outweigh the drawbacks for several reasons.First, many impoverished countries lack the essential resources and infrastructure needed to establish and grow their economies. To escape poverty, it is crucial to invest in basic industries, including electricity, transportation networks, natural resources, technology, and facilities for businesses. Aid can help these nations address their economic challenges and foster entrepreneurship. For instance, South Korea was once one of the poorest countries in the world during the 1960s but transformed into a robust economy largely due to international support for a decade.Second, aid initiatives offer the opportunity for those in wealthier nations to empathize with those facing poverty. When individuals in affluent countries reflect on the struggles of those less fortunate, they gain a greater appreciation for their own prosperity. This awareness not only promotes a spirit of solidarity and compassion but also reinforces the humane values inherent in the concept of globalization.Lastly, such aid campaigns can yield practical economic benefits. In our interconnected world, the economies of various countries are part of a complex network, profoundly affecting one another. For example, when the mortgage crisis hit the United States, it caused economic fluctuations across Europe and Asia, leading many nations to seek international support to prevent economic collapse.In conclusion, I have outlined three key advantages of aid: it helps bolster the economies of poor nations, fosters a sense of compassion and community among people, and supports a stable global economy. I firmly believe that the ongoing efforts of organizations and volunteers to help disadvantaged countries will continue to make the world a better place for all."
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";Throughout history, every transformation has both positive and negative aspects, and globalization—a gradual shift impacting the entire globe—is no exception. While its effects on the world's economy are undeniable, it also carries side effects that contribute to its controversial nature. Many individuals view globalization as a threat to their nation's ethnic and religious values. They argue that this phenomenon endangers their cultural heritage, exposing it to uncontrolled changes and making it vulnerable to imperialistic influences. Conversely, opponents of this perspective believe that globalization significantly contributes to global advancement in various ways. They argue that it enhances access to the world’s natural resources, accelerating scientific and economic development worldwide. Furthermore, they see globalization as an opportunity for people in every country to enrich their lifestyles through the goods and services imported from other nations. Advocates of globalization also emphasize that it leads to a notable reduction in global tensions, as the interconnectedness that arises from shared benefits fosters collaboration among people worldwide. In conclusion, I identify with the supporters of globalization, viewing it as a catalyst for global progress. I believe it is more likely to address the world's challenges rather than exacerbate them.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;Many people assert that children should focus on their studies in school to acquire knowledge that will better prepare them for the future. Conversely, some believe that students might disrupt their educational progress and should be permitted to leave school early to seek employment. Personally, I align with the perspective that students should be encouraged to remain in school.Firstly, schools provide students with a conducive learning environment, staffed by experienced teachers and equipped with high-quality academic programs. This setting enables students to concentrate on their studies rather than wasting time on nonproductive activities. Secondly, schools offer a wealth of academic knowledge. Through their education, students can develop professional skills, broaden their understanding, and gain valuable experiences. As a result, they will have increased opportunities to secure employment and achieve success in the future. For instance, employers often prefer hiring candidates with advanced degrees and specialized skills.On the other hand, some people reasonably argue that children should take time off from their studies to gain work experience. While it is true that children can learn a great deal at school, certain subjects may not hold much relevance for their future careers. Additionally, working can provide children with essential social skills and unique experiences that are difficult to acquire within the classroom. Employment also fosters independence and teaches them to value and manage the money they earn.In conclusion, I firmly believe that students should prioritize their education in school. Although there are some benefits to leaving school for a job, staying in school is ultimately the best option for ensuring a productive future. There are plenty of alternative ways to help children develop independent and social skills without sacrificing their education.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;Today, advertisements are omnipresent, appearing everywhere from television screens to street posters. Some argue that these various ads encourage people to purchase unnecessary products that only appear appealing on screen. I find myself in agreement with this perspective.To increase sales and attract customers, companies invest heavily in advertising. Often, the focus is less on the actual functionality or quality of the products and more on promoting the enjoyable feeling associated with owning them. For instance, major corporations frequently hire celebrities to represent their brands. When famous singers or actors feature in ads for products like motorcycles or clothing, there is often a significant boost in sales, particularly among young consumers who idolize these stars. As a result, the perceived status that comes with owning such products often overshadows the actual quality.Nevertheless, while it's true that advertisements can be misleading and exaggerated, they also play a vital economic role. They introduce new products, offer a range of choices, and, let's not forget, they often entertain us visually as they strive to capture our attention. Moreover, advertising helps maintain competitive pricing and fosters a fair commercial environment. Without it, the market could lean toward monopolistic tendencies, diminishing both price options and consumer choice.Even if the impact of advertising may be overstated, we cannot overlook that the ultimate decision lies with us, the consumers. Regardless of how enticing the advertisements may be, it is essential that we make our own informed choices.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;Guns are certainly not considered a typical good in our society, as they are heavily regulated in most countries. However, gun control varies significantly, with some nations having more relaxed laws than others, making it a contentious issue globally. From my perspective, it is prudent to implement stricter gun control measures.The first point to consider is the risk of accidents involving firearms. While only licensed individuals can legally purchase guns, accidents are still unavoidable. For instance, we often hear reports of injuries occurring during hunting activities. Fewer guns in circulation would likely lead to a decrease in such incidents, ultimately making our communities safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, many violent crimes are linked to gun misuse, particularly in countries where firearms are more accessible. If this trend persists, it could foster a culture of violence. In the United States, for example, young adults and even minors can obtain guns, resulting in tragic events like school shootings. Alarmingly, some terrorists possess more advanced weaponry than law enforcement, leaving citizens in constant peril.Furthermore, gun ownership is associated with increased suicide rates. In the US, firearms account for nearly 50% of all suicides. Tragically, there is a rising trend of suicides among adolescents and individuals aged 75 and older.In summary, given the increases in accident rates, violent crime rates, and suicide rates, I advocate for stricter limitations on gun ownership. It is essential for governments to enact comprehensive laws to protect our societies from violence.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;International sporting events provide an excellent opportunity to foster a global community of fans united by shared passions. These occasions promote a greater understanding among people worldwide and play a crucial role in diffusing international tensions while allowing individuals to express patriotic feelings in a constructive manner.Typically hosted in countries that generate significant interest from fans across the globe, these events create an environment where individuals from diverse nationalities, origins, and religions coexist. Such interactions help to deepen understanding between nations and can be instrumental in reducing hostilities. A notable example is the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which occurred against a backdrop of heightened tension between North and South Korea following a naval incident. Despite the precarious relationship, North Korea demonstrated a spirit of camaraderie and enthusiasm during the tournament, providing a rare glimpse into the country and helping to ease tensions.In addition to fostering better international relations, these sporting events also offer a platform for fans to express their patriotic feelings in a safe environment. Gathering to support their teams, fans channel their emotions through a shared love of the sport. This shared passion creates a space where competition transforms into celebration. Furthermore, participants understand that such events attract global attention and extensive media coverage, motivating them to present a positive portrayal of their nation and its people. During the 2008 Beijing Olympics, for instance, China made concerted efforts to showcase its culture and hospitality, with friendly volunteers welcoming international visitors and highlighting the beauty of their cities. This initiative stemmed from the patriotic desire of the Chinese people to present an impressive image of their country to the world.In summary, international sporting events capture global attention and contribute to a more peaceful world by easing international tensions and allowing for the safe expression of patriotic emotions.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;Over the past two hundred years, technology has made remarkable strides across various sectors of society, including telecommunications, manufacturing, and construction. These advancements have significantly transformed our daily lives. However, some individuals today argue that the widespread availability of technology negatively impacts the wealth gap between the rich and the poor. Personally, I find it difficult to agree with this perspective for several reasons.Firstly, advancements in material technology have led to a substantial decrease in the prices of numerous products. For instance, around a decade ago, mobile phones were prohibitively expensive for many people in my country, with only a select few affluent individuals able to afford them. Now, thanks to cheaper materials and improved production methods, mobile phones have become commonplace in households. As a result, a larger segment of society, especially those with lower incomes, can enjoy the benefits of these technological developments.Secondly, technological progress enhances productivity, allowing individuals to free themselves from mundane chores and invest more time and energy into education and leading more fulfilling lives. The rise of the Internet has brought us immense convenience and enjoyment. In the past, obtaining information or correspondences from distant friends took considerable time. Today, we can connect with friends online regardless of our locations. Additionally, the Internet provides equal access to information for everyone, fostering a greater sense of equality among individuals.It is important to recognize that technology, like many things, has its pros and cons. There is a valid argument that technology can widen the divide between the wealthy and the less fortunate, as only the affluent can afford expensive high-tech products that may yield increased earnings. However, I believe that this concern does not outweigh the significant benefits of technology, and it is not the primary cause of inequality.In conclusion, the advantages of technology are indisputable. When utilized properly, technology can provide humanity with substantial benefits and continuous opportunities for progress.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;For centuries, outer space has captivated researchers and scientists alike. Numerous space missions have been initiated, many of which have achieved remarkable success. Yet, there remains a segment of the population that views space exploration as a frivolous expenditure, pointing out that astronauts often return with little more than unremarkable rocks, despite the significant investment in their missions. Nevertheless, there are compelling reasons for humanity to venture into outer space.To begin with, space exploration allows us to uncover numerous truths about our solar system. For example, images taken from space have conclusively shown that Earth is round rather than flat. Another critical discovery is that it is Earth that orbits the sun, not the other way around. Without such exploration, these essential facts might have remained unknown.Furthermore, observing Earth from space enhances our understanding of our own planet. Through these observations, scientists have gathered valuable insights about our atmosphere and other environmental factors. This knowledge equips us to tackle critical challenges like global warming and other ecological threats.Finally, space exploration fosters technological advancements. Due to the need for astronauts to safely travel where there is no breathable air, researchers have made significant strides in developing oxygen tanks. These tanks, initially meant for space travel, have proven useful in underwater operations as well. Additionally, innovations such as spacecraft, communication satellites, and even space pens have made significant contributions to our society.In conclusion, I believe that humanity should continue exploring outer space. Despite the substantial costs involved, the numerous benefits of space exploration, as outlined above, make it a worthwhile endeavor.
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;In today's world, it's common for students to take on part-time jobs as soon as they begin university. While this trend can have some drawbacks, I firmly believe that the benefits far exceed the disadvantages. In this essay, I will discuss several advantages associated with this issue.Firstly, gaining practical experience is a significant benefit of part-time employment for students. These jobs provide valuable opportunities to apply their academic knowledge in real-world settings. This hands-on experience becomes increasingly important given the lack of practical training offered in many university programs. Consequently, students who work part-time not only acquire theoretical knowledge but also develop essential skills in a professional context. Additionally, having job experience while still studying gives graduates a competitive edge in the job market.Secondly, students who engage in part-time work often exhibit increased confidence and independence compared to their peers. Regular interaction with colleagues in a workplace environment allows students to express their ideas freely, which significantly boosts their self-assurance. Moreover, the demands of a job encourage students to think independently and tackle problems effectively—traits that are beneficial when they encounter challenges in their studies.Lastly, part-time jobs can help students with their living expenses. The high costs associated with tuition and accommodation can be overwhelming, but the income from these jobs, even if modest, can alleviate some of these financial pressures. Furthermore, earning their own money fosters independence and reduces dependence on family support, better preparing students for their future lives.In conclusion, I strongly believe that holding a part-time job while studying provides students with numerous advantages. By taking on additional work, students can address several challenges, including gaining work experience, building confidence, and managing living expenses. I anticipate that the trend of students seeking part-time employment will continue to rise in the future.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;This essay aims to explore the benefits that students and organizations derive from allowing students, sent by their schools, to work for companies without receiving salaries. I will first examine the advantages for both students and organizations, then conclude the discussion.To start, students gain invaluable experience during their time interning at assigned institutions. Most school curriculums focus on theoretical learning, with instructors delivering lectures to students within the confines of the classroom. As a result, students may have limited insight into the genuine challenges and realities they will face in the workforce after graduation. Therefore, although internships are unpaid, they offer experiences that are far more valuable than monetary compensation.For companies, utilizing unpaid interns can lead to significant cost savings. Additionally, younger interns can contribute fresh ideas, as they are not yet constrained by the limitations that often come with established workplace norms, allowing for greater creativity—an asset when developing new marketing campaigns or slogans. Furthermore, organizations can begin identifying potential future employees and initiate their training, thus conserving time and resources in the recruitment process.In conclusion, internships provide students with practical, hands-on experience outside of traditional educational settings, enhancing their employability prospects. Meanwhile, organizations can save both time and money while benefiting from the innovative perspectives that younger individuals bring to the table.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;"The aim of this essay is to explore whether increasing employees' salaries is the only effective means of motivating them to work harder and enhance their productivity. I will begin by examining various factors that contribute to increased productivity before concluding with my perspective on the matter.Undoubtedly, salary increases or promotions can significantly boost workplace morale. Employees recognize the need to intensify their efforts to meet their bosses' expectations and demonstrate their value. For instance, junior high school teachers carry the dual responsibility of guiding their students through a critical period of personal growth and academic achievement. This stage is crucial for students, as it greatly influences their chances of gaining admission into desired high schools. If teachers receive higher salaries, they may be more inclined to invest extra time in mentoring their students rather than relying solely on external tutoring. This is particularly relevant in Taiwan, where such a trend is common.However, I contend that fostering a positive work environment is a more realistic and vital approach to enhancing productivity and employee performance. Take Google, for example; the company provides recreational areas and additional personal leave to create a more relaxed and supportive workplace. By adopting such measures, employers ensure that their employees can concentrate fully on their projects rather than being preoccupied with personal stressors or family responsibilities.In conclusion, while higher salaries can serve as one incentive for encouraging employees to work harder, creating a secure and enjoyable work environment can significantly enhance productivity. When employees feel valued and supported, they are more likely to give their best efforts in return."
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;For many individuals across the globe, the desire to gather together and engage in friendly competition with talented people from diverse cultures through popular games has long been a powerful motivation. This inclination is so deeply rooted in people's consciousness that organizing such events continues even amidst significant social challenges faced by some participants. It is widely recognized that large-scale sports competitions redirect attention from international conflicts to exciting contests and foster a sense of national pride. This can be illustrated by exploring how sports events serve as a bridge to peace and promote the display of national symbols.Firstly, during periods of war, individuals in heavily affected countries can escape the bleakness of their surroundings and connect with the rest of the world by following international sports events. For instance, during the devastating Second Gulf War, many in Iraq sought updates on the Football World Cup through their portable radios. This illustrates how international sporting competitions uplift spirits and create pressure for individuals to eventually return to a relatively peaceful state of normalcy. Therefore, global sports events play a significant role in fostering friendships and promoting peace.Secondly, such sporting occasions provide a valuable opportunity for people to express their national pride. For example, when the Football World Cup took place in South Africa, crowds filled the stadiums, cheering and waving national flags in support of their team. Traditional South African songs echoed through the streets late into the night. This demonstrates how individuals draw upon various aspects of their heritage and history to proudly showcase their identity while supporting their team. Consequently, it's evident that international sports events allow for the free expression of patriotic sentiments.In conclusion, a closer examination of the impact of global sporting events, both for war-torn nations and host countries, reveals that they not only significantly contribute to the advocacy for a peaceful society but also encourage public displays of national pride. This dynamic has persisted for centuries and is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;The growing population and advancements in technology have led to an increased demand for energy compared to the past. It is widely believed that there are several abundant and eco-friendly resources available, such as nuclear and solar energy. In this essay, I will explore these areas in detail.To begin with, water remains the primary source of energy today. Despite significant water shortages affecting electricity production, many countries still depend heavily on this resource. The fundamental resources for generating such vast amounts of energy are becoming insufficient. As a result, developing countries like India often experience power outages during the summer months. If governments actively promote the use of nuclear, solar, or wind energy, it could alleviate issues related to electricity distribution. Therefore, it would be a prudent decision for governments to expand electricity generation to include alternative sources.Moreover, many of the energy sources currently in use emit large quantities of gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. For instance, opting for a solar cooker instead of an electric one would significantly help reduce global warming. Similarly, utilizing nuclear energy as an alternative to hydro-kinetic energy results in less atmospheric pollution.In conclusion, it would be beneficial for the government to promote the adoption of alternative energy sources. This approach would enable better utilization of available natural resources and help mitigate global warming. Additionally, the government should encourage and motivate the public to embrace alternative sources such as solar and nuclear energy.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;Unemployment is undoubtedly a global issue affecting both developed and developing nations. However, I believe it is primarily the responsibility of individuals facing these challenges, rather than the government, to take initiative in improving their situations.Government funds should be allocated exclusively to programs that benefit the public. Tax revenue is generated from those who are employed, and using these funds to support individuals who are not contributing to society seems unfair to taxpayers. Moreover, there are urgent needs for government spending in areas like healthcare and education, which makes addressing unemployment a lower priority.In today's competitive environment, individuals must work diligently and equip themselves with the necessary skills. If people receive financial assistance without any strings attached, it might diminish their motivation to seek employment.That said, we cannot ignore those who genuinely require assistance. Individuals in difficult circumstances may struggle to overcome their challenges without external support. In such cases, the government should consider offering free vocational training or providing interest-free loans to help them reintegrate into the workforce. When the unemployed can contribute again, it ultimately benefits society as a whole.In conclusion, while I believe the government should assist disadvantaged individuals, direct financial aid may not be the most effective solution. It is crucial for people to rely on their own efforts to overcome adversity.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;"Universities have rapidly become the go-to institutions for individuals looking to enhance their expertise. However, this focus may not align with the needs of potential employers, as universities have transformed into realms of specialization, where an increasing amount of information is known about increasingly narrow topics. Despite this, there are often training programs available that have direct relevance to job-seeking and various aspects of daily life. While I appreciate the universities' intention to offer such programs aimed at developing job-related skills, I believe this is not their primary or most valuable function.A university, fundamentally, serves as a platform for accessing and disseminating knowledge. This means that the primary audience for universities should be the students, not the employers, since students are there to pursue knowledge. High school graduates opt for further education in universities for various reasons: to obtain widely recognized degrees, to gain insights into specific industries, or simply to explore their research interests in depth.Furthermore, universities are seen as institutions rich in educational resources. As such, there is no requirement for them to offer specific courses or trainings; instead, it is more important that they provide access to resources as needed. The reality is that universities should prioritize facilitating access to information, rather than curating courses that cater to employer preferences.In summary, the fundamental role of a university is to provide knowledge and access to resources. That said, it would be beneficial if universities could also offer courses focused on workplace skills to assist students in shaping their future careers."
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;The issue of preserving wild animals in zoos often sparks intense debate. Advocates argue that professionals provide excellent care for these animals, while critics contend that captivity robs them of their freedom. In my opinion, wild animals should inhabit their natural environments rather than live in zoos.Firstly, wild species have the inherent right to exist away from human intrusion. Given that humans are often responsible for significant pollution and destruction of natural habitats, it is our duty to ensure these animals have safe and natural spaces to thrive in. The confined spaces and artificial environments found in zoos cannot adequately compensate for the habitats lost to them. Furthermore, prolonged captivity can adversely affect the physical and mental well-being of these creatures, leading to issues such as isolation and depression. In this light, zoos may act more like jailers than protectors of wildlife.On the other hand, proponents argue that modern zoos, staffed by skilled professionals, provide superior care for animals. They also claim that the endangered species housed in zoos are shielded from threats like illegal hunting. However, I would argue that enforcing strict anti-poaching laws would better protect various species in their natural habitats. Expanding and preserving these environments seems to be the most effective means of safeguarding wildlife globally.In conclusion, I firmly believe that wild animals deserve to be freed from zoos—not just because they have a right to freedom, but also to avoid the negative impacts of isolation and depression.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;The current debate revolves around the question of whether distance learning should be prioritized, or if in-person attendance at lectures should remain the dominant approach in universities, as some argue that traditional learning is superior to online degrees. In my view, online education should be broadly embraced by colleges and universities due to its convenience and cost-effectiveness for educational institutions.First and foremost, distance learning offers significant convenience for students around the globe. In the past, students often had to settle for nearby schools, despite variations in teaching quality, faculty credentials, and institutional reputation, simply to avoid long commutes. Today, however, students can enroll in online courses from prestigious universities and colleges worldwide. Additionally, video conferencing technology enables instructors to reach a larger number of students simultaneously. As a result, educational institutions can optimize costs by improving teacher-student ratios. The affordability of online education also allows universities to offer scholarships to exemplary students who face financial difficulties and cannot attend in-person classes.On the other hand, critics of online degrees argue that attending lectures in person fosters valuable interactions among students and instructors. They emphasize that traditional teaching methods, which encourage discussion and collaboration, are integral to campus life. These real-life interactions can greatly enhance the educational experience.In conclusion, I believe that the significance of distance learning will continue to grow as the pace of life accelerates. Nonetheless, it is essential that discussions and interactions take place regularly via video conferencing to maintain the enjoyment of learning.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";Recent advances in communication technologies like mobile phones, emails, and internet chat applications such as MSN Messenger have significantly transformed our lives. However, there is still some debate regarding whether the impact of these innovations is predominantly positive or negative. Despite valid opposing views, I firmly believe that a majority of people worldwide have greatly benefited from these powerful and effective communication tools.Firstly, modern communication devices, including mobile phones, enhance our ability to stay connected with friends and family across long distances, as well as facilitate global business interactions. With just a click, vast amounts of information can be sent from America to China within seconds. Furthermore, these communication tools are generally accessible around the globe. Whether at a bus stop, a local shop, or virtually anywhere else, individuals can engage in conversations or send messages using a mobile phone or laptop. Thus, it is clear that these new forms of communication offer significant convenience to humanity.Nevertheless, critics argue that the advantages of modern communication technologies are primarily enjoyed by those with greater financial means. They emphasize that the widespread adoption of these efficient communication methods often comes at a steep cost. Individuals seeking to utilize these innovations must invest not only in devices like mobile phones or computers but also in ongoing communication services. As a result, those living in poverty are less likely to reap the benefits of these modern technologies.In conclusion, I believe that as the pace of life accelerates, more people will benefit from modern communication technologies in the future. However, we cannot overlook the disadvantaged who may be left behind because they cannot afford these advancements.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;Many people argue that music should be a core subject in high school, while others believe it is unnecessary and should be offered only as an elective. In this essay, I will explore both viewpoints.It is clear that music possesses a significant power to positively impact individuals and their mental well-being. For this reason, many universities offer music courses, allowing students to engage with music and foster a harmonious environment. I believe that students, who often find themselves overwhelmed by the demands of various academic subjects, should have the chance to relieve stress through music. Additionally, when musical activities involve multiple participants, it encourages cooperation and teamwork, skills that are valuable in their future careers. Furthermore, students with less strong academic performance might excel in music, creating a more serene classroom atmosphere.On the other hand, while music can greatly enhance students' mental well-being, our fast-paced world does not prioritize musically inclined individuals but rather seeks academically proficient employees. Thus, I tend to agree with the majority opinion that music, as an art form, requires a dedicated approach. Unfortunately, many students may not experience its intended benefits unless they engage with it more seriously. As such, I argue that music and other recreational subjects should remain optional. In today’s world, where time is of the essence, students should focus on developing skills relevant to their future careers rather than merely playing an instrument or singing.In conclusion, to be competitive in the job market, students need to have advanced knowledge in their chosen fields. However, while music can play a role in personal development, its incorporation into the educational process should be successful only when it is not mandatory.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;"Libraries and sports activities are crucial elements for the success of universities, and most university rankings consider the quality of both. In my view, universities should prioritize investment in libraries over other areas.Firstly, a library is a fundamental and strategic asset for any university. Both professors and students rely on a modern, well-equipped library, which plays a key role in research alongside the internet. While sports are important, they do not hold the same level of priority as libraries. Additionally, a relatively small percentage of students participate in sports activities; for instance, at my university, the number of students using the library far exceeds those engaging in sports.Secondly, libraries typically do not generate income, as they are often free for both students and the public. Therefore, university support is crucial for sustaining library services. In contrast, sports activities tend to generate revenue through various channels, such as sponsorships and ticket sales for matches. This creates an opportunity for sports programs to offset their expenses more easily than libraries can.Furthermore, investing in libraries yields long-term benefits. Libraries can acquire new books and additional computers, and their resources tend to remain stable and valuable over time. Conversely, many sports facilities, aside from buildings, are typically utilized for short periods and do not offer the same level of durability.Although sports activities hold their own significance, libraries are of greater importance to the core functioning of universities. A reputable university must have a modern library as an essential component of its academic environment."
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";As globalization advances, English has emerged as the dominant language in international trade, conferences, and numerous significant events. This trend has sparked intense public debate.Proponents argue that the widespread use of English offers numerous advantages. Primarily, it facilitates easier and clearer communication and interaction among countries. In the past, language differences and geographical barriers impeded the exchange of goods and ideas. Thankfully, innovations like planes and trains have addressed these geographical challenges. If we promote the widespread adoption of English, we can also eliminate the language barrier. Moreover, English is a beautiful language, characterized by a systematic structure and a breadth that surpasses many other languages. Learning English can enhance individuals' appreciation for literature and the arts.Conversely, critics contend that the dominance of English threatens cultural diversity and leads to the extinction of many lesser-used languages. While English is a complex language, it often falls short in conveying the intricacies of life, especially in Asian countries with entirely different linguistic systems. It cannot be denied that language reflects many aspects of daily life, shaped by culture, environment, and religion. For those who speak these languages, their significance is profound, and replacing them with English can seem crude.In my view, while English should be promoted as a refined language to advance global trade and communication, it is also essential to preserve other languages to maintain linguistic and cultural diversity.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;Humans have established dominance over other living beings on earth primarily due to their advanced cognitive abilities. This superiority has led to the domestication of numerous animals and birds, allowing individuals to enhance their comfort and convenience. While many advocate for the use of animals to fulfill personal needs, others express concern over the ethical implications of such practices. This essay will explore both sides of the debate surrounding animal domestication.Humans have utilized various animals for their benefits, such as cows and other dairy animals for milk production. Additionally, animals like horses, cattle, and donkeys are employed in farming, agriculture, and transportation. Many people also keep pets like dogs and cats, often training them for specific roles—such as service animals for the visually impaired or as assistance to law enforcement. Furthermore, pets are commonly kept for security purposes within homes.Conversely, some farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their natural limits. For instance, cows may be injected with oxytocin, a hormone used to artificially enhance milk production, leading to significant discomfort and pain. Moreover, countless animals suffer or die in the name of scientific research for drugs and various products. Cage farming practices violate animal rights, while equestrian sports often subject horses to grueling conditions, where they are pushed to run long distances and sometimes beaten by jockeys to increase their speed. Additionally, the cruel practice of trophy hunting poses a severe threat to defenseless animals.In my view, humans should strive to act as guardians of animals rather than as their overlords. Animal rights exist to impose ethical boundaries on human behavior, and any misuse or exploitation of them should be treated as a serious crime.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";"It has become increasingly common for people to view exhibitions from the comfort of their homes through television or the internet, thanks to modern technology. As a result, some individuals believe that museums and art galleries may soon become obsolete. However, despite the advancements in technology, I firmly believe that many museums and art galleries will continue to thrive.On one hand, technology undeniably makes life easier. By watching exhibitions on TV or the internet, individuals save both time and money, which is particularly appealing in today’s fast-paced society. Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that the modern lifestyle can be detrimental to health, as it often results in a lack of physical activity and diminished face-to-face interactions.On the other hand, the role of museums and art galleries is crucial for education and cultural preservation. Authentic exhibits cannot be fully replicated through images or videos; experiencing them in person is far superior, much like traveling to a destination is more enriching than merely viewing it on-screen. Additionally, museums and art galleries serve as vital custodians of cultural heritage, ensuring that these institutions remain relevant as long as people continue to value their cultural roots.In conclusion, while I acknowledge that modern technology has created a more convenient way for audiences to access exhibitions, museums and art galleries are essential to preserve for their crucial educational and cultural significance."
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;Currently, it is generally agreed that students should study more than eight subjects in school. However, public opinion varies on whether to teach a broad range of subjects or to concentrate exclusively on a single one. Some parents are pleased with their children's full class schedules, while others argue that focusing on one subject can be more beneficial. Before sharing my own perspective, I will examine both sides of this debate.The advantages of exposing students to various subjects are readily apparent. Firstly, having a foundational knowledge across different fields allows students greater flexibility when selecting specialized areas or careers in the future. Adolescents, being still young and inexperienced, may struggle to identify their long-term passions. From the students' perspective, a mix of challenging and easier subjects can help balance the stress of academic workload and boost their interest in learning. Nevertheless, many teenagers find the diverse curriculum overwhelming, leading to increased stress from the volume of homework and exams. Additionally, a significant number of students view the extra subjects as irrelevant and impractical for their future careers.Proponents of focusing on a single subject argue that this approach can nurture more specialized talent and enhance academic effectiveness. By concentrating their efforts on one area, students can devote more time and energy to mastering that subject, alleviating some pressure from other classes. However, the drawbacks of this educational model should not be overlooked. Most crucially, in a highly focused learning environment, students may find it difficult to reconsider their initial choices and shift their area of specialization in the future. Moreover, the monotony of studying only one subject could dampen their enthusiasm for learning.While it is clear that concentrating on one subject can alleviate student pressure and foster effective talent development, the potential drawbacks are significant for their future prospects. For this reason, I advocate for a comprehensive education that encompasses all subjects.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;In today's world, it is evident that the rise of English has led to the decline of many minority languages. Some argue that this is a reasonable sacrifice for the sake of globalization, while others believe that the drawbacks outweigh the advantages. Personally, I align with the former perspective.It is impossible to overlook the significant advantages that come with the global acceptance of English. Firstly, it facilitates communication across countries and cultures, making interactions much easier. In my country, English is a mandatory subject starting from elementary school. As a result, many young people find it easier to study abroad, erasing language barriers and fostering mutual understanding and trust between their homeland and host nations. This leads to improved relationships and boosts international trade. Moreover, researchers, especially in high-tech fields, benefit from a broader array of resources when proficient in English. For instance, many top scientific publications in the IT industry are in English. Relying on translations can be cumbersome, making fluency in English essential.Critics may argue that the dominance of English contributes to the extinction of lesser-known languages each year, thereby eroding cultural heritage and national identity. However, this perspective is shortsighted, overlooking the rapid progress of local economies and societies.In conclusion, despite some negative implications, I firmly believe that the widespread use of English offers substantial benefits to individuals and countries alike. I encourage all young people to learn English, given its pivotal role in globalization. At the same time, measures such as documentation and preservation efforts should be implemented to safeguard native languages and cultures.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the ordinary. Unfortunately, many governments impose restrictions on the artistic expressions of creative individuals. True creativity flourishes in a liberated mind, which is why it is essential for artists to have the freedom to convey their ideas without constraints.Throughout history, many renowned artists, including Michelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, and Shakespeare, have produced works that carry significant social messages. From sculptures and paintings to literature, theater, and film, these creations have mirrored the social issues of their times. Artistic expressions play a vital role in raising social awareness by conveying important messages.Moreover, innovative works encourage people to reflect on their own values and recognize various truths in a peaceful manner. They can highlight pressing issues and critique governmental wrongdoings. A noteworthy example is the Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin, who faced accusations of opposing the government simply for addressing a social concern. Such attitudes present obstacles to nurturing creative minds. Furthermore, creativity also adds aesthetic value to society.Regrettably, numerous governments continue to impose restrictions on artists. Frank Zappa once stated, ""The mind is like a parachute; it doesn’t work if it isn’t open."" Limitations stifle the innovative potential of artists and constrain their creativity. Just as the media requires freedom, artists should also be allowed to express themselves without fear.That said, artists should exercise caution not to offend the sentiments of others. Many creatives have found themselves embroiled in controversy for upsetting the religious or social beliefs of the public. It is crucial for artists to cultivate self-awareness and avoid producing offensive, harmful, or meaningless works that lack purpose. I strongly believe that artists deserve the freedom of expression, as creativity cannot thrive when confined by restrictions. The imagination flourishes best when the mind feels unshackled and free from governmental pressures or limiting laws."
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;"Modern society is rife with intense competition. While some argue that instilling a cooperative mindset in children is vital, others believe that competition is the key to success. However, fostering a cooperative approach enables children to develop into responsible adults with strong moral values and a supportive social network.Cooperation is crucial for effective teamwork, and educational systems increasingly focus on nurturing this quality in children. We exist within a social framework where mutual support and collaboration pave the way for success. No one can master every skill or achieve every milestone alone. For example, lions hunt in packs; their collective effort allows them to secure prey more efficiently. Similarly, a cooperative mindset can save time and energy while enhancing success rates.Moreover, cooperation fosters an understanding of different perspectives and offers lessons from others' mistakes. It allows individuals to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses in relation to their peers. Witnessing the accomplishments of others can also be a source of inspiration and motivation. Nonetheless, competition holds its own importance alongside cooperation.Unfortunately, the concept of competition has often been misconstrued. Individuals should aim to compete with themselves rather than against others. Healthy competition has driven advancements in science and technology, propelling innovation and progress. For instance, companies constantly develop new car models that outperform their predecessors, providing consumers with a wider array of choices.However, ruthless and self-serving competition can be damaging. A mindset of ""your loss is my gain"" is seldom beneficial in the long run. Competition should focus on personal improvement rather than undermining others. The most effective competition encourages individuals to elevate themselves above their peers.In conclusion, cooperation and competition complement each other. They are two sides of the same coin, inseparable in their importance. I strongly believe that children should be taught the value of cooperation alongside a spirit of healthy competition. They should also be educated about the pitfalls of selfish competition. When cooperation and healthy competition coexist, achieving success, recognition, and meaningful goals becomes much more attainable."
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";"Crime invariably warrants punishment, and retribution serves as a means to address criminal behavior. While some nations enforce strict penalties, such as capital punishment, others adopt more lenient judicial approaches. Nevertheless, stringent measures like capital punishment play a crucial role in maintaining societal order.Capital punishment is reserved for the ""rarest of the rare"" cases, with its primary goal being the protection of society from individuals who pose significant threats due to their potential for committing heinous acts. By imposing such severe penalties, society is shielded from particularly dangerous criminals.Additionally, capital punishment serves as a deterrent, reducing the allure and potential for future violent crimes. When potential offenders are aware of the severe consequences they might face, they are less likely to engage in criminal behavior, leading to a decrease in crime rates.From a financial perspective, capital punishment also alleviates the burden on government resources, which would otherwise be spent on managing and rehabilitating criminals who show no prospect for reform. Those with a history of egregious offenses may rightfully face capital punishment.However, it is essential to recognize that jurors, being human, possess the power to impact a person's life and can make errors in their judgments. Careful consideration of the circumstances surrounding a crime is crucial. For instance, a murder committed in self-defense should not be equated with a callous act of violence. Only those individuals who consciously commit grave offenses while fully aware of their actions should face capital punishment.In summary, capital punishment is a vital tool for controlling violence within society. I firmly contend that individuals such as psychopaths and terrorists, who display a lack of empathy for others, merit capital punishment. This measure upholds human rights effectively, although it should be reserved as a last resort. All relevant circumstances must be thoroughly examined before delivering a final verdict."
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;Education plays a crucial role in shaping lives. Some countries allow students to take a gap year between high school and university, while in others, this is seen as a wasted opportunity. However, a year off after high school can be highly beneficial for young individuals.Typically, students engage in continuous education from ages 5 to 16. Allowing a one-year break can offer them a refreshing change. The sustained pressure of over a decade can lead to mental fatigue, causing students to feel like mere automatons, rigidly following instructions. A break provides the chance for students to recharge their minds through travel or pursuing hobbies. As a result, when they resume their studies in university, they often feel rejuvenated and ready to tackle new challenges.Furthermore, many high school students grapple with the decision of which field to pursue. Taking time off to work or travel can aid them in discovering their passions. Additionally, gaining work experience can teach them about professional environments. They may also earn some money to help fund their university education, or use this time to prepare for their preferred course.On the flip side, there are potential downsides to taking a gap year. It may disrupt a student's focus and negatively impact their academic journey. Earning money during this time can create a false sense of security about financial independence, leading some to become complacent. For example, my cousin took a job at a customer care center after high school, which ultimately distracted him, resulting in poor performance at university. There’s also the risk of engaging in unhealthy habits like smoking or drinking. Nevertheless, the decision to take a break should be a personal choice, as individuals vary in how they use that time. Ultimately, the advantages of a gap year generally outweigh the drawbacks.The fundamental goal of education is to cultivate young minds rather than impose relentless studies. Therefore, it is essential to allow a break between high school and university. In countries like India, where such breaks are frowned upon, it is important to recognize that young people are vulnerable and face intense competition. A year off can provide them with the necessary tools to confront life's challenges effectively.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";"Computers have transformed human life in unprecedented ways. Since Charles Babbage, often referred to as the ""Father of Computers,"" first conceptualized the computer, its evolution has been relentless. Today, the global reliance on computers is immense; without them, society would regress by centuries.In contemporary life, computers are ubiquitous. They are essential for everything from piloting aircraft to transmitting small documents. Their applications span various fields, including space exploration, military operations, healthcare, education, and beyond. Computers have enhanced human existence by making tasks easier, more convenient, and incredibly fast. For instance, what once took months to relay a message to another country can now be accomplished in mere minutes with an email and a few clicks. They boost speed, efficiency, accuracy, and productivity while offering an array of additional benefits.Looking ahead, the future of computing appears promising. From massive machines that once filled entire rooms, computers have shrunk to palm-sized devices. Advances in nanotechnology are paving the way for microscopic computing. Research is also underway for autonomous drone soldiers controlled by computer systems. The evolution of computing seems limitless.However, this technological advancement has its downsides. Our increasing dependence on computers has led to vulnerabilities, such as viruses, privacy breaches, confidential data leaks, cyberattacks, identity theft, and various types of fraud. Furthermore, computers can expose children to inappropriate content and contribute to mental health issues, such as Facebook Addiction Disorder, characterized by excessive use of social media. There are concerns about surveillance, with satellites capable of intruding into our private lives, as highlighted by high-profile incidents like the Wikileaks data leak.Despite these drawbacks, computers also offer security and sophistication. Therefore, relying on them is not inherently negative. It is essential to remain mindful of their advantages and disadvantages while being cautious about potential risks. The invention of computers was intended to benefit humanity, and in many ways, it has achieved that aim. Today, life without computers is unimaginable, making a complete abstention from them impractical."
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;Education plays a crucial role in the advancement of society. The question of whether universities should enroll equal numbers of male and female students in each course is a subject of debate. However, both genders are equally important and should be granted equal opportunities. Universities should strive to admit an equal number of students from both genders based on their preferences. The right to education is a fundamental human right for everyone, regardless of gender. As the world moves towards empowering women, it is essential that females receive the same opportunities as males. By admitting equal numbers of both genders, universities can foster an environment where all students can cultivate their talents and contribute to a healthy sense of competition.Co-education offers significant benefits by promoting interaction between genders. It teaches students how to communicate, cooperate, and work together effectively. For instance, students in all-boys schools may lack the skills to engage with females appropriately, while those in all-girls schools might feel too timid to interact with boys. Co-education can help overcome these challenges. Providing equal opportunities for both genders in universities prepares them for future challenges and contributes to long-term societal progression.Regrettably, some male chauvinists hold the misguided belief that women are incapable in specific fields such as mathematics, mechanical engineering, or defense. This gender-biased mindset hinders societal progress. Women have consistently proven their capabilities across various fields, with inspiring figures like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, and Marie Curie serving as testaments to women's intelligence and skills. Therefore, I firmly advocate for equal rights for both genders, suggesting that universities should admit students in equal numbers. Educational equality is vital for societal development, as both genders are fundamental to society, and neither is superior to the other. The choice of field should be determined by personal interests and merits, independent of gender. Educational rights must be equally accessible to everyone.
62;Do you agree or disagree with the statement: people will spend less time on cooking food;Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.;Cooking is arguably one of the most significant activities in people's lives, impacting everyone on a daily basis. While some believe that individuals should invest a great deal of time in cooking, I contend that people are more inclined to spend less time on meal preparation. Several reasons support this perspective, with two key points standing out.First and foremost, advancements in science and technology have led to the development of modern kitchen appliances, such as microwaves and sophisticated pressure cookers, which greatly reduce cooking time. Today, individuals typically take an hour to prepare a meal, compared to the two or three hours it might have taken a decade ago. Recently, many people have recognized the benefits these technologies offer for home cooking, and this awareness continues to grow alongside ongoing technological improvements. Thus, it is clear that reducing the time spent on cooking will likely become the norm in the near future.Another reason for this trend is that many young people prefer dining out, as they wish to devote more time to work or studies for personal growth. A recent survey indicated that 89% of respondents believe that, given the competitive and pressured nature of modern life, they need to dedicate significant time to improving their skills and staying up-to-date. Consequently, they often find it challenging to set aside time for meal preparation. When they do have free time, they are more likely to go out with friends to unwind from their responsibilities.Some may argue that dedicating more time to cooking ensures better nutrition and food quality for families. While there is some truth to this, it's important to note that utilizing modern technology does not diminish the nutritional value or quality of food. In fact, devices like ozone machines can effectively eliminate bacteria, mold spores, and pesticides from produce and meats, thereby ensuring the health and safety of consumers. Furthermore, with the rise in living standards, the quality control and supervision of food in restaurants have become increasingly stringent. As a result, enjoying a nutritious meal without spending excessive time cooking is quite achievable.In conclusion, considering all of these factors, it is evident that there are compelling reasons to support my stance. Therefore, I firmly believe that people will continue to spend less time on cooking in the future.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;Games have been essential to children's development, particularly in enhancing their skills. With advancements in technology, children now have greater access to modern games. This has sparked ongoing debates about the relative significance of traditional versus modern games in developing children's abilities. In my opinion, parents and educators should place greater emphasis on traditional games.While modern games can indeed be advantageous for children in certain areas, such as computer literacy and awareness of current trends, they are not without limitations. To engage in online gaming, children must become adept at using computers and the Internet, which can equip them with valuable skills for future employment. Moreover, exposure to cutting-edge technology can foster a sense of innovation, helping children adapt to contemporary advancements.Nonetheless, I argue that traditional games are vital for children's learning, proving to be even more important than modern games in today’s society. One of the key advantages of traditional games is their ability to enhance children's communication skills. In contrast to many modern games that facilitate interaction primarily between children and machines, traditional games create a social environment where children can interact, share laughter, and collaborate face-to-face. This exposure helps them develop the confidence to engage with a wide range of individuals.Additionally, the educational value embedded in traditional games contributes to their lasting relevance. Many traditional games were thoughtfully designed by educators and have consistently demonstrated their effectiveness in fostering various skills in children over time. In contrast, modern games are often developed by profit-driven companies, which raises concerns about the potential exposure of children to inappropriate content, such as violence or sexual themes, as these companies seek financial gain.In conclusion, traditional games should not be overlooked by parents and educators in the context of modern gaming. They play an essential role in ensuring that children have a positive and healthy approach to skill development.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;"Efficient allocation of government budgets has long been a subject of public debate. Recently, there has been a push for increased investment in healthcare and education rather than entertainment or sports facilities. In my view, this approach would be far more advantageous for society.Addressing the needs of countless individuals grappling with illness or lack of education is a more pressing and practical concern than constructing theaters or sports complexes. In fact, an uneducated person may find it difficult to appreciate musical performances, while someone suffering from health issues due to inadequate medical care may be unable to participate in sports activities. Consequently, prioritizing education and healthcare should be the government's focus.Entertainment venues like cinemas, theaters, and sports stadiums are primarily driven by profit. Their viability relies on effective marketing, the quality of their facilities, and audience turnout. The inherent competition among these establishments is a natural aspect of a free market, and government intervention in this sector is unwarranted. In contrast, the establishment of healthcare services and educational institutions aims to enhance community well-being and standards rather than generate profit, making them more deserving of government funding.Moreover, using taxpayer money to build theaters or sports venues is inequitable to those who may not benefit from them. For instance, not everyone enjoys attending live musicals, so it seems inappropriate to allocate a significant portion of taxpayers' funds to cater to the preferences of a minority. This is why sectors like healthcare and education merit greater governmental investment; they provide essential services that impact the daily lives of all citizens.In conclusion, I firmly believe that government budgets should prioritize healthcare and education over entertainment facilities. These sectors are not only more vital but also serve the public good and are accessible to the majority of the population."
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;"In the 21st century, it is widely accepted that technology serves as a primary catalyst for productivity. As a result, countries have actively pushed for technological advancements in recent years, often overlooking any potential drawbacks. Some people express concerns that modern technology could hinder the preservation of traditional techniques and ways of life. However, I believe these fears are unfounded; in fact, technology plays a crucial role in enhancing and promoting these traditions.When it comes to accessibility, technology has made it easier and more effective to showcase traditional skills and lifestyles. In the past, individuals could only experience specific traditional practices by visiting local areas, which often limited participation for those who were busy with work or hindered by transportation challenges. Today, with the advent of the Internet—one of the most significant innovations in modern society—people can easily access demonstrations of traditional techniques from anywhere, at any time.Furthermore, technology has transformed the presentation of traditional cultural heritage, making it more vibrant and engaging. For instance, during the Shanghai World Expo, China successfully showcased its traditional techniques using cutting-edge technologies like robots and LED screens. This integration of modern technology with traditional culture left many tourists worldwide in awe of its seamless blend.While some worry that technology might negatively impact traditional lifestyles, arguing that especially younger generations are increasingly drawn to new digital products, I believe this trend is not a major concern. In recent years, there has been a growing movement among people to reconnect with their traditions.In conclusion, technology undoubtedly supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. The future of traditional culture lies in its ability to embrace modern technology, ensuring its development and relevance for generations to come."
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our often monotonous lives; however, some argue that they have been granted too much freedom and power, suggesting that the government should impose restrictions. I firmly believe that the freedom to express thoughts and ideas should always be celebrated, and it is fundamentally unjust to limit an artist's creative will.One primary concern about allowing artists complete creative freedom stems from the fear of social misrepresentation, which could disrupt society. However, I maintain that audiences possess their own judgment and are unlikely to be swayed or deceived by artistic expressions. Art inherently involves imagination, embellishment, and occasionally fabrication; regardless of whether an artwork is rooted in reality, it is up to the public to interpret its significance. If an artwork presents an unrealistic portrayal, the audience is fully capable of recognizing its falsehood and appreciating it purely for its artistic value. Conversely, if an artwork reflects reality, what justification exists for its censorship other than to obscure uncomfortable truths? Would it not be authoritarian for the government to silence artists who are merely revealing the truth? Thus, the fear of social misrepresentation is unfounded.Let us also consider the impact of art on individuals. It is undeniable that some artworks may contain negative themes such as insanity, violence, and eroticism. I fully agree that there should be restrictions on young audiences, as adolescents may not have the maturity to discern these messages. However, for adult viewers, there is nothing to conceal—the harsh realities these themes represent exist in the world, and it is implausible that adults could be easily influenced or brainwashed by creative works.In conclusion, I do not support the notion of imposing restrictions on artists' work; rather, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas. Our world needs artists to enrich and diversify our experience."
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The rising crime rate has prompted calls for the government to take action to curb the increasing portrayal of violence in the media. It is clear that violence is often sensationalized in media productions to capture audience attention. This can set a poor example for impressionable viewers who, lacking proper parental guidance and the ability to discern right from wrong, may mimic these violent behaviors and potentially commit real-life acts of violence, mistakenly believing such actions are justified.Conversely, media outlets like television and film are expected to serve as accurate sources of information regulated by the government, reflecting the realities of society. While violence is indeed a part of the world we live in and should be reported, its excessive portrayal can lead to distorted perceptions and have harmful effects on society. Recently, there was a report about a seventeen-year-old boy who, driven by hatred and jealousy, killed his entire family—an alarming incident that illustrates how an extreme response to minor issues can manifest, influenced by constant exposure to violence.It is undeniable that our society is currently inundated with violent imagery and narratives. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to enhance censorship measures to limit the depiction of violence in media. If left unchecked, the rate of violent crime could continue to escalate uncontrollably.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";"Modern society has experienced significant transformations across various facets of life, notably with the rise of feminism. Women now have more opportunities than ever before, which I believe marks a positive development for humanity.First and foremost, equality between men and women is essential in a developed society. The era when women were relegated solely to mundane household duties and childcare is long behind us. Today, women actively participate in numerous fields, becoming successful business leaders, politicians, scientists, and more. This illustrates that what has often been perceived as the ""weaker"" gender possesses both the rights and capabilities to contribute to society on par with men, and in many areas, they even excel.Furthermore, the advancement of women's rights has yielded numerous benefits not only for women but for society as a whole. For instance, families experience a reduced financial burden when both partners contribute to the household income. Additionally, women naturally excel in certain professions, such as healthcare and human resource management, due to their patience and attention to detail.It is true that these changes can lead to some drawbacks, such as an increase in divorce rates and challenges for women trying to balance their professional responsibilities with traditional roles as wives. Moreover, children may receive less attention from parents who are both occupied with work. However, every situation has its pros and cons, and women have the capacity to find effective solutions to navigate these challenges.In conclusion, a society that offers women equal opportunities alongside men is likely to reap substantial benefits that far surpass any obstacles encountered."
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";"As we consume news through newspapers or television, we are often drawn to environmental issues like traffic congestion and air and water pollution. Effective initiatives are needed to tackle these specific concerns. Given the far-reaching consequences of pollution and traffic problems, merely raising petrol prices—although a method currently discussed in society—is insufficient for achieving real solutions.Price controls have been successfully implemented in various sectors, such as agriculture and real estate; however, their effectiveness in alleviating traffic and pollution issues warrants careful consideration. On one hand, governments tend to adopt a macroeconomic approach when regulating prices, responding to societal demands, which makes immediate increases in petrol prices challenging. On the other hand, pollution arises not only from oil combustion but also from chemical pollutants and excessive lighting, which significantly contribute to the problem. Furthermore, enhanced work efficiency leads to a faster pace of life, resulting in increased traffic congestion during peak hours.As previously mentioned, several alternative solutions could help mitigate pollution and traffic congestion. First and foremost, authorities should focus on enhancing public transportation infrastructure, such as expanding bus routes, to encourage reduced reliance on private vehicles. Additionally, implementing temporary targets to limit pollutants over specific time periods—such as a season—along with establishing regulatory bodies to monitor and address these issues, would be beneficial. Simultaneously, fostering a culture of environmental awareness is crucial; while its effects may not be immediate, it is a prudent long-term strategy.In conclusion, solely relying on higher oil prices to tackle pollution and traffic issues is inadequate. Instead, investment in improved transportation facilities, the creation of regulatory institutions, and the promotion of environmental consciousness would provide a more comprehensive approach."
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The advertising industry has never been as advanced as it is in modern society, leading to some negative public sentiments due to the prevalence of exaggerated and false information. This has sparked significant controversy over whether all advertisements should be banned. In my opinion, while some advertisements are indeed problematic, we cannot overlook the benefits they provide.Firstly, it would be unjust to restrict public service advertisements, which are often creative and inspiring. These ads aim not at profit but rather at promoting valuable cultural norms, encouraging good moral behavior, and raising awareness for the disabled and impoverished.Additionally, advertising a particular brand or product through mass media can significantly boost sales for companies. In a broader context, this can stimulate household spending and drive overall economic growth. A recent study found that sales revenue can increase by 40% following an advertising campaign, underscoring the positive impact that advertising can have on the economy.However, it is important to acknowledge that advertisements do have their drawbacks. The costs associated with advertising can lead to higher prices for products, and some ads may spread misleading information, creating an information gap between consumers and companies. Nevertheless, the advantages of advertising generally outweigh these negative aspects.In conclusion, advertisements fulfill a social responsibility and play a role in fostering economic growth. While we cannot dismiss all advertisements, banning those that convey exaggerated or false information could make the advertising landscape more acceptable to the public.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;In today’s fast-paced society, many individuals encounter significant challenges and stress. As a result, it is essential for many to discover effective ways to unwind. While a variety of methods, such as reading, watching films, or tending to gardens, can be employed, I believe that exercising in its various forms is the most effective way for modern individuals to alleviate stress. Exercise not only enhances physical health but also fosters positive emotions.It is well-established that exercise is vital for improving physical well-being. Activities like jogging, swimming, or playing basketball significantly enhance the respiratory and circulatory systems. Additionally, these forms of physical activity help build muscle strength and reduce excess body fat, a critical factor considering the rising obesity rates in today’s world. Research shows that the number of overweight individuals has increased in developed nations primarily due to a lack of physical activity.Exercise also positively impacts mental health. During physical activity, the brain releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which promotes feelings of happiness and contentment. Thus, engaging in regular exercise can effectively relieve stress and anxiety. Furthermore, vigorous exercise helps develop resilience and determination, empowering individuals to manage challenging situations and demanding tasks.In conclusion, while there are numerous ways to relax, I maintain that exercising is the most effective method for reducing stress, offering significant benefits for both physical and mental health.
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";"The saying ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" has long been a popular adage, highlighting the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, and emotions. However, the significance of the written word cannot be overlooked, as it remains a common and crucial form of communication. Therefore, while I acknowledge that images often serve as a more effective means of communication in today's world, this viewpoint has its limits.To begin with, images can significantly shape public perception. For instance, graphic imagery on cigarette packaging illustrates the dangers of smoking, leading to a slight decrease in smoking rates as individuals become more aware of the harmful consequences. Similarly, Kevin Carter’s iconic photograph of a starving child in Sudan powerfully brought attention to the extreme poverty faced by many in that region. Furthermore, visual content is prevalent in newspapers, magazines, and advertising, demonstrating that images alone can capture and hold attention effectively.On the other hand, the written word is essential for conveying precise messages. Without textual context, images can be subject to subjective interpretation. In contrast, words provide clarity and understanding to visual representations. Additionally, the primary method of educating students relies on written content, with academic textbooks combining text and visuals to enhance comprehension.In summary, both images and words complement each other, and it is essential not to prioritize one over the other. For communication to be truly effective, these two elements must work together—images to illustrate and words to inform or elaborate on specific topics."
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;It is undoubtedly true that numerous languages are fading away across the globe each day. As a result, some individuals believe that governments should allocate funding to preserve these languages. However, others argue that this is not a feasible solution. In my opinion, this perspective warrants a thorough examination, and this essay will address the issue.To begin with, it is clear that languages, particularly spoken ones, are a fundamental aspect of a country's culture. They enable people to differentiate between nations and even various regions within a nation. The extinction of a minority language signifies the loss of a country’s traditions, customs, and heritage. Therefore, governments should invest in preserving these languages to enrich the cultural diversity that makes our world fascinating. Moreover, a rich cultural heritage fosters national pride and can inspire citizens to develop a deeper love for their country.Conversely, there are challenges associated with the preservation of minority languages. Despite government investment, achieving significant results can be difficult. Many young people, in particular, show little interest in learning and maintaining these languages. These languages are often complex and unfamiliar. Additionally, preservation efforts require considerable time and resources to gather, restore information, and provide training in educational institutions. Without genuine effort from the community, these initiatives can stall, resulting in wasted resources.In conclusion, I firmly believe that every language should be preserved and developed to the fullest extent possible. It is essential for everyone to contribute to this effort, with governments playing a crucial role in promoting and facilitating these initiatives.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;"I believe that the government should prioritize investing in essential social welfare programs, such as education and housing, rather than subsidizing arts-related initiatives. While art can enhance one's quality of life, education is a far more significant determinant of overall well-being. To genuinely improve people's lives, it is urgent for governments to allocate funds toward fundamental supports, like increasing scholarships in education for all citizens. Knowledge and wisdom are crucial for elevating the quality of life within a well-functioning society.It is true that art plays a valuable role in enriching daily life; for instance, it can alleviate academic stress and provide relief after a long day of work. However, in many developing countries, it is unrealistic to prioritize such cultural pursuits when fundamental issues like adequate housing persist. Numerous low-income families are still living in cramped spaces, making the pursuit of art seem relatively insignificant in comparison.In conclusion, while art can contribute positively to the quality of life, I believe that governments should focus more on pressing social issues like education and housing. These areas are vital for ensuring that people can lead decent lives."
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;Despite advancements in modern society, access to healthcare and education remains fundamental rights for all citizens. A contentious debate today centers around whether the government should bear the responsibility for funding these essential services.Proponents argue that the government has an obligation to support citizens' healthcare and education. They believe that everyone deserves to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which requires government intervention and leadership. Without access to proper healthcare and education, individuals risk compromising both their physical and mental well-being. This can lead to delayed medical treatment, which may diminish their productivity and negatively impact industry stability. Moreover, inadequate educational guidance can lead to misbehavior and even criminal activities, jeopardizing the security of the community. Thus, it is essential for the government to take responsibility for healthcare and education to ensure a safe and stable society.Conversely, critics contend that it is an inefficient use of public funds for the government to subsidize healthcare and education for every citizen, especially since many individuals can afford these services privately. They argue that the government should focus on addressing more urgent social issues, such as rising crime rates, the AIDS epidemic, and infrastructure shortages, which require immediate financial attention.In my view, the government should prioritize funding for healthcare and education for those in genuine need. Simultaneously, individuals able to pay for these services should advocate for the government to redirect resources towards more pressing concerns. Ultimately, fostering a harmonious society necessitates collaboration between the government and its citizens.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;Children often visit zoos to see a variety of wild animals up close. The debate about whether zoos should exist in modern society is heated, with animal rights activists arguing that wildlife should live in their natural habitats and advocating for the banning of zoos. However, I do not share this perspective, as zoos offer invaluable benefits for animal conservation and children's education.It is undeniable that our environment is increasingly jeopardized by relentless economic development that harms ecosystems, posing a significant threat to the survival of many species. Zoos serve as a vital alternative for protecting these animals, as they provide specialized care and attention. If an animal falls ill, trained veterinarians are available to provide prompt medical assistance. This dedicated care helps ensure the survival of diverse wildlife populations.Furthermore, zoos serve as educational platforms for young people, fostering an understanding of the importance of environmental stewardship. While the animals in zoos are contained, they still have the opportunity to roam within limited spaces. When children visit zoos, they can observe the animals' feeding habits and social interactions, enriching their knowledge about different species. Additionally, guided tours and volunteer programs educate children on how they can contribute to the protection of wildlife.Despite criticisms regarding zoos, such as poor management leading to animal suffering due to food shortages and the impact of long-term confinement on animals' survival skills, I believe zoos can create beneficial environments for endangered species. They can extend the lifespan of these animals and promote a culture of conservation. To enhance their effectiveness, zoos should focus on improving management practices and wisely utilizing their resources to better conserve wildlife.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;Many countries have successfully advanced their economies by fostering national industries. However, there are concerns that in industrialized nations, achieving economic goals may come at the cost of environmental health. From my viewpoint, a thriving economy can coexist with environmental conservation.It is true that some countries prioritize economic growth over environmental protection, which can lead to the degradation of local ecosystems. Many of these developing nations lack the financial and human resources, advanced technology, and experience necessary for sustainable practices, forcing them to rely heavily on natural resources to sustain their populations. Additionally, individuals in impoverished regions may not possess the knowledge required to protect their environments. This often results in irresponsible exploitation of local resources, placing significant pressure on natural ecosystems. In this context, it seems that economic development and environmental preservation can indeed be at odds.Nonetheless, I am convinced that a booming economy can be intricately connected to environmental protection. As awareness of the green economy grows, consumers are increasingly favoring products that are free of pollutants, indicating that eco-friendly businesses can attract customers and drive sales. For instance, electric bicycles powered by clean energy have gained popularity in recent years.Moreover, considering environmental impacts can lead to greater operational efficiency. Environmentally conscious companies are motivated to optimize their resource use, enhancing their production processes and equipment, which can elevate productivity and economic growth. In contrast, companies that do not prioritize environmental sustainability often face high energy consumption, contributing significantly to their operational costs and hindering their economic potential.In conclusion, it is possible for economic growth and ecosystem preservation to advance together. Additionally, I believe that developed countries have a responsibility to assist developing regions by providing financial resources, technology, and expertise to address environmental challenges effectively.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;"In recent years, as people's awareness of democracy has grown, there has been an increasing concern about how the government allocates tax funds. Consequently, some argue that tax dollars should prioritize public welfare services over the arts. However, I believe that the arts also deserve a place in government investment. It is undeniable that the government should prioritize public services and facilities. As a leader, it has a responsibility to ensure that tax money is used effectively to maintain safety and stability in society. Essential public services like education and healthcare address people's fundamental needs for survival, security, and knowledge, contributing to overall comfort and potentially reducing crime rates. Therefore, it is crucial for authorities to allocate sufficient resources to these public services to uphold social stability.Nevertheless, the government must not overlook the importance of the arts. Culturally, the arts enhance people's lives. In today's fast-paced and competitive environment, individuals often find themselves overwhelmed with work and studies. As a result, they seek various forms of entertainment, such as music, films, and literature, to relieve stress and unwind. Without access to the arts, many risk facing psychological challenges.From a community perspective, investing in the arts also supports local cultural and economic growth. Arts are closely tied to cultural heritage; by preserving local artistic traditions, communities can foster a sense of belonging among residents and stimulate the local tourism sector. In this way, the arts play a dual role in promoting both cultural and economic development.In conclusion, while public services and facilities are critical components of government spending, it is equally important for authorities to recognize the value of the arts, which provide both individual and societal benefits."
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;Since their inception, zoos have faced both support and criticism. Some people argue that zoos can be entertaining and ecologically significant, while others contend that confining animals is fundamentally wrong. Both perspectives will be explored before arriving at a thoughtful conclusion.Critics of zoos assert that keeping animals in captivity is unjust, as animals should be recognized as non-human individuals deserving of freedom. They argue that it is cruel to remove them from their natural habitats and confine them to small enclosures. Many zoos, particularly in developing nations, often fail to provide the necessary care and attention for their animals. As a result, these animals frequently suffer from malnutrition and lack adequate medical treatment. Moreover, some animals from warm climates are forced to endure the frigid winters of Europe.Conversely, proponents of zoos argue that they offer valuable entertainment and contribute to ecological balance. Many visitors, especially young children, find joy in observing their favorite animals, playful baby animals, and creatures from diverse regions around the globe. Zoos also fulfill an educational role by providing insight into the lives of various species. Additionally, they play a crucial part in conserving numerous animal breeds, preventing them from extinction. By keeping animals in enclosures that replicate their natural habitats, zoos can protect endangered species from predators and poachers, thereby helping to maintain ecological balance.In conclusion, while both arguments are compelling, I believe that the benefits of zoos outweigh the drawbacks. However, it is essential that zoos enhance their standards to ensure that the animals receive proper care and attention.
80;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, picture, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?;Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.;In most countries, artists are granted the freedom to express their thoughts through their work. However, some contend that government restrictions are necessary to moderate their opinions. I, on the other hand, support this notion only to a certain degree and believe that artists should enjoy the freedom to create, as it leads to the production of truly remarkable masterpieces.Primarily, imposing control over an artist's ideas stifles their creativity over time. When artists are free to express themselves, they often think outside the box, creating exceptional works, be it in painting or film. For instance, the iconic paintings by Da Vinci and Michelangelo continue to be celebrated today precisely because they were free from restrictions in their era. In essence, removing limitations will result in a greater abundance of awe-inspiring creations from artists.Moreover, every individual has the right to express their opinions freely, provided it does not disrupt societal harmony. Many nations strive to uphold their democratic values, and art serves as a vital medium for critiquing social issues and government policies. A notable example is the film '3 Idiots', starring Aamir Khan, which critiques an education system heavily reliant on rote memorization rather than practical application. Denying artists the freedom to express their views undermines fundamental human rights.However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of unrestricted artistic freedom. Artists may delve into subjects that could lead to controversy. For instance, in a multicultural country like Malaysia, where citizens coexist harmoniously, any artistic commentary on sensitive racial matters could incite unrest. Nevertheless, I believe that artists are generally aware of their boundaries and would not want to damage their reputations through reckless behavior.In conclusion, it is clear that there should be no restrictions placed on artists' work. Granting them the freedom to think creatively allows for genuine self-expression and the natural flow of ideas. While unregulated expression can sometimes yield negative consequences, it also fosters the creation of beautiful and meaningful art. Therefore, I firmly advocate for the absence of restrictions on artistic expression.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;"In today's world, advertising through various media channels like newspapers, radio, and television has become increasingly common, making it an integral aspect of modern society. While many argue that advertising has significantly enhanced our lives and should be viewed positively, others hold a contrasting perspective. This essay will examine both viewpoints before reaching a balanced conclusion.To begin with, advertising is primarily aimed at promoting products and services or encouraging consumer spending. As such, advertisements play a crucial role for many businesses in boosting sales and, consequently, profits. Moreover, consumers also gain advantages from advertising; for instance, those seeking telecommunication services can learn about the latest offers from various companies, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding internet or mobile phone plans. It is clear why the notion of advertising as a beneficial element of life enjoys considerable support.On the other hand, there are valid criticisms of advertising due to its adverse effects. For one, the sheer volume of unsolicited ads can inundate personal phones and email accounts, commonly referred to as spam, leading to frustration for many users. Additionally, advertising campaigns can be costly, and not all of them yield successful outcomes, resulting in financial strain for businesses. Consequently, some view advertising as a significant economic burden.In conclusion, while both perspectives on advertising are compelling, it appears that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. As a result, the argument for advertising as a positive aspect of life is stronger."
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;"Nuclear technology often sparks intense debate, with advocates arguing that nuclear power offers an efficient and cost-effective energy source. Conversely, critics contend that atomic technology is inherently risky and difficult to manage. Personally, I align with the opponents of nuclear power, believing that its drawbacks significantly overshadow its limited benefits.One of my primary concerns is that the development of nuclear technology often paves the way for the creation of atomic weapons. The previous century laid bare the devastating consequences of such weaponry, and if nations continue to explore fusion and fission, some may attempt to repurpose these processes for military ends.Additionally, even peaceful applications of nuclear energy pose severe risks related to radioactivity. A recent incident involving a nuclear power plant leaking large amounts of radioactive material following an earthquake underscores this danger; despite our best efforts to ensure safety, accidents can and do happen.Furthermore, all energy generation methods, including nuclear power, inevitably produce waste. However, managing nuclear waste presents significant challenges, and no permanent solution has yet been found. This waste is often far more harmful to the environment than other hazardous materials.In conclusion, while nuclear power may seem like a viable solution to the energy crisis, the associated risks and challenges greatly outweigh its benefits. Therefore, I advocate for a discouragement of nuclear technology, even for civilian applications."
83;Some people argue that the government should give every unemployed person a mobile phone and should make sure they have access to the Internet. They believe this is the best way of using the public money to reduce the problem of unemployment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.;Currently, the unemployment rate is increasing and has sparked significant debate among the public. Some people argue that a viable solution to this issue is to provide the unemployed with mobile phones that offer Internet access. They believe this approach is an effective way to allocate public funds. However, I partially disagree with this solution, as I view distributing mobile phones to the jobless as a misuse of resources.From a positive standpoint, equipping unemployed individuals with smartphones that have Internet connectivity would enable them to explore more job opportunities. For instance, they could visit online job portals such as The Star Online’s employment section to find positions suited to their skills. Moreover, with access to the Internet, they could research potential jobs and prepare themselves accordingly. Additionally, these smartphones could facilitate direct communication with potential employers. Therefore, providing mobile phones could help the unemployed secure employment and improve their living situations.On the other hand, allocating funds to provide mobile phones for unemployed individuals could be seen as a waste of taxpayer money. These funds might be better spent on projects that benefit the wider community, such as building more public amenities or aiding those living in poverty to help them become self-sufficient. In summary, public funds could be directed toward more productive initiatives instead of purchasing mobile phones for the unemployed.Moreover, offering free mobile phones may encourage some individuals to exploit this opportunity, potentially leading to deliberate joblessness. Some may even falsely claim unemployment to qualify for receiving a phone. In such cases, public funds would be squandered. Furthermore, there is a lack of surveys or evidence demonstrating that this approach effectively reduces unemployment rates.In conclusion, the proposal to provide jobless individuals with Internet-enabled mobile phones is not the most effective way to address unemployment. I recommend that the government thoroughly assess the backgrounds of those in need before distributing mobile devices. It is essential that public funds serve the broader society rather than support individuals who may not actively seek employment.
84;The use of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras in streets, stations, shops and other public places has increased rapidly in recent years. Although we are told that these cameras help in the fight against crime, some people are opposed to their use. They believe that everyone has a right to privacy. What are your views?;Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.;Today, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are extensively utilized in various settings, including schools, businesses, and other establishments, primarily for monitoring activities. The advantages of CCTV are undeniable, particularly in terms of reducing crime and ensuring employee safety. However, some people argue that constant surveillance infringes on their privacy. Nonetheless, I firmly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in all premises to address the rising theft rates and to safeguard workers.Firstly, having CCTV cameras in workplaces can significantly reduce crimes like robbery. When a theft occurs, the footage obtained from these cameras serves as crucial evidence, aiding in the identification and apprehension of perpetrators. For example, in Malaysia, law enforcement used CCTV footage to track down and successfully capture a group of robbers who had broken into a 7-Eleven store at night. Additionally, the presence of surveillance discourages potential theft among employees, as they are aware they are being watched. Clearly, CCTV systems should be implemented in every workplace to help lower crime rates.Moreover, in many offices, employees often deal with disgruntled or angry customers, which can sometimes place them in potentially dangerous situations. The installation of CCTV cameras can provide a layer of protection for these employees, as customers are aware their interactions are being recorded. In case of disputes, the recorded footage can clarify the situation and inform any necessary actions. In short, these cameras serve as a protective measure for workers against difficult customer interactions.On the other hand, the use of CCTV cameras does generate some debate. Opponents voice concerns about their privacy being compromised due to constant monitoring. However, it is crucial to recognize that safety takes precedence over privacy, and prevention is always preferable to dealing with the aftermath of a crime. Therefore, those opposed to CCTV should consider the importance of personal safety and take steps to protect themselves from becoming victims.In conclusion, CCTV cameras are vital and should be mandated in all premises primarily to protect individuals from potential dangers posed by intruders or thieves. While it is true that privacy may be sacrificed with the implementation of these systems, prioritizing safety is essential for ensuring a secure environment.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;Today, living is possible in various parts of the world, yet differences still exist among them. In my opinion, large cities can be an excellent environment for raising children.Firstly, it is clear that education in urban areas tends to be superior to that in rural regions. For example, in my country, the top schools, universities, and educational institutions are found in cities. Education plays a critical role in children's lives today, making it beneficial for them to spend their formative years in urban settings.Additionally, cities offer a wide array of recreational facilities. Children living in urban areas have access to numerous entertainment options, including playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas, and more. In contrast, rural areas often lack such facilities, with children frequently spending their leisure time on farms.Moreover, children in big cities have greater access to media, allowing them to learn through television and the internet. This access enables them to connect with peers from around the world, facilitating knowledge exchange and exposure to diverse cultures.In conclusion, while rural areas offer advantages like fresh air and tranquility, modern children require engaging activities and opportunities to make the most of their free time.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";There are various types of jobs within society, with some being offered by government-related companies and others by private enterprises. While both sectors come with their own pros and cons, I personally prefer the idea of owning my own business and working for myself. There are numerous advantages to self-employment compared to working for someone else.Firstly, private sector jobs provide a wealth of opportunities that are often unavailable in traditional employment. As your own boss, you have the autonomy to make decisions, whereas, in other jobs, you are typically under someone else's supervision. This can lead to significant stress, as you must consistently meet the expectations and demands of your employer, a situation I find undesirable.Moreover, when you work for yourself, you directly reap the rewards of your hard work. In contrast, when employed by someone else, any profits generated primarily benefit your employer, such as your manager. Sadly, in many cases, they receive a substantial share of the profits without offering a fair distribution to their employees, which I believe is unjust.Additionally, self-employed individuals enjoy more flexibility compared to those working for others. When you are your own boss, you can set your own hours and manage your time as you see fit. Life's unexpected events—like illness, traffic delays, or the desire for a vacation—can occur without the need for permission from a supervisor. In many workplaces, however, such occurrences require approval, which is often denied.While working for others certainly has its merits, I envision that business owners experience greater comfort and freedom. They have access to more opportunities, higher potential profits, and greater control over their schedules.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";Throughout their lives, many individuals encounter at least one failure in various areas such as education, relationships, and financial matters. While some believe that the best approach after experiencing failure is to move on and forget about it, I completely disagree. I firmly believe that a person who faces defeat should persevere and continue striving to achieve their goals.Firstly, facing failure provides valuable learning opportunities. Individuals can gain insights from their setbacks, allowing them to identify and avoid repeating the same mistakes in future attempts. For example, many inventors encounter numerous challenges and failures in the early stages of their work, but they ultimately learn how to navigate these obstacles as they progress.Secondly, experience demonstrates that continuous engagement in a task leads to greater expertise. As individuals work consistently, they accumulate knowledge and skills, which significantly increases their chances of success in their final endeavors. For instance, scientists often conduct experiments over extended periods, and through this process, they develop a deep understanding of the subject before reaching conclusive results.In conclusion, I maintain that people should not give up in the face of failure. Instead, they should focus on extracting lessons from their experiences, which in turn will enhance their capabilities and lead to eventual success.
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;Today, many countries face pressing issues, two of the most significant being the rising population and the plight of endangered plants and animals. While I recognize the importance of protecting endangered species, I believe that human needs should take precedence.Firstly, the global population is steadily increasing, which in turn drives up the demand for food. We require farmland to cultivate essential crops like wheat and corn, and it is clear that without food, people cannot survive for more than a few weeks. Consequently, farmland is indispensable for human survival.Secondly, individuals need shelter to protect themselves from the elements, such as harsh weather and natural disasters, as well as from wild animals. Housing is one of the fundamental human necessities, second only to food, and its importance cannot be overstated.Lastly, to sustain life, humans require various essential resources, many of which are industrial, including medicine. Therefore, some land should be allocated for industrial use. Modern life presents numerous challenges that can be alleviated through industrial advancements.In conclusion, the population of endangered species is far smaller than that of humans, meaning they require significantly less land. I argue that, in light of the growing population, the need for farmland, housing, and industry outweighs the necessity of preserving land for endangered animals.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";"Every individual possesses two defining traits: appearance and personality. In my opinion, while appearance does hold some significance, personality ultimately holds more weight. It is unjust to evaluate a person solely based on how they look. Some people make the mistake of associating skin color or facial expressions with character; for instance, they may believe that those with dark skin or serious expressions are untrustworthy, while assuming that those with fair skin or constant smiles are inherently good. I strongly disagree with these types of judgments.Firstly, many individuals can manipulate their appearance to deceive others, which highlights the importance of looking beyond superficial traits. For example, some people may present a cheerful demeanor and articulate speech, yet turn out to reveal their true natures only after a significant commitment, such as marriage.Secondly, there are individuals with darker skin, larger body types, or serious expressions who can be truly wonderful friends and colleagues. I once had a neighbor who was elderly, had dark skin, and often appeared stern, which made me anxious around her. However, one chilly winter day, I realized I had lost my house keys on my way home from school. She kindly invited me to wait with her until my parents returned. Not only was she welcoming, but her kindness and hospitality left a lasting impression on me. This experience taught me an invaluable lesson about the dangers of judging people based on their appearances.In conclusion, the most effective way to assess others is by understanding their personalities rather than focusing on their outward appearances. Unfortunately, many people put on a façade to mask their true selves, emphasizing the need to look deeper than the surface."
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;The 21st century has seen the rise of globalization, prompting many to question whether a single international language should be considered essential. In my opinion, having a universal language that dominates the global sphere is crucial for people around the world.One of the key areas where a single international language is vital is in global economic cooperation. When business professionals from different nations share a common language, their ability to communicate about trade becomes more efficient and profound, fostering greater transnational collaboration. Conversely, the absence of a shared language can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts during negotiations, hindering effective partnerships. Thus, a universal language serves an important economic function.Moreover, a common language is essential for cultural exchange and interaction. When individuals can communicate in a single international language, they can easily share insights about their unique cultures, including traditions and contemporary lifestyles, broadening their perspectives and enriching their worldview. For instance, when tourists visit other countries, the ability of locals to share information about attractions in a universal language enhances the visitor experience, allowing them to enjoy their travels more fully.Nevertheless, we cannot overlook the potential drawbacks of promoting a universal language. Specifically, the adoption of a single global language can, to some extent, undermine a nation's cultural identity. This is because individuals may become captivated by the cultural values associated with the universal language, weakening their sense of national belonging. For example, some individuals in Asia may now seek individualism—previously suppressed in many Asian cultures—due to the influence of American values portrayed in imported films, which have gained popularity alongside the spread of English.In conclusion, while a single international language plays a significant role in facilitating economic and cultural communication within the global community, it is equally important for each nation to prioritize the preservation of its cultural heritage.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;With the increasing accessibility of the Internet, individuals can now access a vast array of information regarding the latest fashion trends worldwide, including popular shoe styles for the season and favored clothing colors of the year. However, some argue that people should prioritize dressing in a personal style rather than adhering to fleeting fashion trends. In my opinion, fashion trends play a more crucial role in people's lives than personal dressing styles.Following fashion trends allows individuals to stay informed about global changes, which is particularly important in today's interconnected world. By actively engaging with the latest developments in fashion, people become more open-minded and receptive to diverse perspectives from around the globe. Conversely, if someone clings to their own style without acknowledging the work of top fashion designers, they may end up becoming insular and miss out on broader cultural experiences, potentially putting themselves at a disadvantage.Additionally, those who lack a solid understanding of aesthetics or originality may struggle to develop their own fashion sense without being influenced by contemporary trends. For such individuals, staying updated on current fashions aids them in selecting and coordinating outfits, which might otherwise be challenging.On the other hand, it’s true that an excessive focus on fashion trends can stifle individuality. When everyone follows the same trends, it can lead to a sense of uniformity in style, making the fashion landscape feel monotonous.Taking all this into consideration, I conclude that, particularly for those lacking fundamental aesthetic knowledge, it is beneficial to pay attention to fashion trends to stay in sync with the evolving world. Meanwhile, individuals with creative design talent should embrace their unique ideas and cultivate their own distinctive fashion styles.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";The question of whether affluent nations should take on the responsibility of aiding poorer countries by providing infrastructure—or simply stand by as observers of global poverty—is a contentious issue. Personally, I believe that as a fortunate minority, wealthy nations have an obligation to share their resources with those in need.From an ethical standpoint, it is inhumane to witness fellow human beings grappling with hunger and poverty while remaining idle, particularly when one has the means to help. Compassion—a value emphasized in nearly all religions, from Buddhism to Islam—is what sets us apart from animals.Economically, such assistance can create a mutually beneficial scenario. Undoubtedly, developing nations gain immediate advantages from foreign aid. Additionally, challenges in underdeveloped regions could lead to new medical issues that necessitate research and innovation in the developed world, ultimately advancing the pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, many of these poorer countries have large populations that represent significant market potential. By fostering positive relationships with them, wealthy nations can expand their markets and enhance future global trade. In return, developing nations may offer local agricultural and mineral products at reduced prices, thereby stimulating both economies.In conclusion, the support offered by wealthy nations is not only a moral imperative but also a strategically beneficial investment that will yield rewards in the future. Those who empathize with their fellow human beings are bound to thrive in the long run.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;Focusing on health education and preventive measures rather than treatment is an exceptionally wise and beneficial policy for both individuals and governments. When implemented, it yields numerous advantages for society.Health education fosters lasting positive impacts on future generations. By receiving comprehensive health education from an early age, children develop healthy habits that they are likely to maintain into adolescence. For instance, a child who learns about hygiene and healthy living in their formative years is more likely to continue these practices as they grow older. Moreover, health education equips individuals, particularly children, with the essential knowledge needed to protect themselves against disease risks. Instead of reacting with fear or panic, they can respond calmly to common ailments like allergies or seasonal illnesses. Many minor health issues that could be easily managed can escalate into serious conditions without the right knowledge and treatment. Implementing health education ensures that people make informed choices about their treatments, facilitating quicker recoveries.Preventive measures significantly enhance the overall health of the population. For example, vaccinations help safeguard pregnant women and their babies from serious infectious diseases such as influenza, smallpox, and rubella. Organizing large-scale vaccination campaigns across the country can substantially improve community health. Given that human capital is crucial for national development, investing in public health is a wise decision. Furthermore, prevention often incurs much lower costs than treatment, allowing governments to save considerable funds for healthcare budgets.In conclusion, I firmly believe that prioritizing health education and preventive strategies over treatment is essential. However, it is equally important to ensure that treatment options are reasonably available so that all citizens receive the best possible care.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;In today's world, news media have gained immense popularity, leading some to argue that their drawbacks outweigh the benefits. However, this perspective may be overly simplistic. News media not only provide entertainment but also enhance people's knowledge. Consequently, it is reasonable to assert that this trend is largely positive.To begin with, accessing entertainment has become easier than ever. Various news mediums, including television, radio, and newspapers, deliver entertainment news from around the globe to audiences everywhere. Individuals can relax by watching their favorite programs, ranging from musical performances to live sports events, right from their homes after a long day. This accessibility reinforces the notion that the rise of news media is beneficial to society.Moreover, news media play a crucial role in expanding people's knowledge. They offer a diverse array of global news covering essential topics such as political developments, economic shifts, and climate change. As a result, individuals today are better informed about world events, which is particularly important in an era where globalization is affecting nearly every aspect of life. The rapid evolution of news media thus facilitates a greater understanding among people around the globe.In summary, the advancement of news media has significantly impacted people's lives. It provides them with ample entertainment options and enriches their knowledge with global information. Additionally, it contributes positively to various other aspects of life. Therefore, the growth of news media can be viewed as a beneficial development.
95;Under British and Australian laws, a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.First and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.Apart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.To conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.;It is widely recognized that under British and Australian law, jurors in a case are not privy to the defendant's prior criminal history. Some individuals believe that this practice should change, advocating for juries to have access to at least some information about the accused prior to making their verdict. I completely support this viewpoint, as I believe it offers significant advantages to various stakeholders, which I will elaborate on below.Firstly, having access to a defendant's background would likely facilitate more informed decision-making by juries. Understanding an individual's history could help jurors analyze the circumstances surrounding the crime, leading to a more nuanced evaluation of intent. For instance, consider a scenario where a person with no prior offenses is suddenly found guilty of a serious crime. With knowledge of the accused's background, jurors could better discern whether the crime was committed intentionally or under specific circumstances, thereby allowing for more appropriate sentencing.In addition, this approach could contribute to achieving fair trials. Jurors typically lack extensive legal knowledge, so providing them with information about a defendant's past would enable them to think critically and piece together the elements of the case more effectively. Consequently, jurors would feel more confident in their verdict, having based it on a broader array of evidence. This not only ensures that the judgment is more sound but also guarantees that the convicted individual receives a fair response.It is important to acknowledge that revealing the defendant's background can raise concerns about privacy. If someone is later exonerated, they may feel embarrassed when their past becomes public knowledge. Nevertheless, I contend that the public has a right to be informed about the crimes of individuals, as this awareness can help prevent future victimization.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the current practice governing juries' access to defendants' histories should be revised. Understanding the background of the individuals they judge is crucial for jurors to deliver fair, reliable, and informed verdicts. Implementing such changes will undoubtedly yield positive outcomes, as progress often requires reevaluating and modifying existing practices.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;International sporting events, such as the football World Cup, garner immense attention, drawing millions of spectators from around the globe. As sports have transcended national boundaries to become a universal passion, these major competitions can significantly alleviate international tensions while fostering a sense of national pride in a positive manner.Firstly, sports events provide excellent opportunities for top athletes to meet each other and exchange valuable experiences, enabling them to enhance their performance, set new records, and achieve victories for their respective nations. With large crowds gathering in host cities, attendees have the chance to explore diverse cultures. Consequently, sporting events, underpinned by principles of health, honesty, and fairness, can foster understanding, friendship, and solidarity among nations. After competing, athletes often exchange friendly gestures, such as handshakes and congratulatory remarks, which can strengthen diplomatic relations.Secondly, these occasions ignite patriotic sentiments in both athletes and spectators alike. The sight of national flags being honored evokes strong emotions among competitors, heightening their sense of responsibility and desire to contribute to their homeland. When people see their flags flying proudly, they are inspired to express their pride and joy openly. For instance, when Vietnam celebrated its first championship win at the SEAGAMES in 2008, the streets were filled with a festive spirit. People of all ages flocked to the streets with flags and banners, singing songs dedicated to President Ho Chi Minh. This jubilant atmosphere persisted for days. While a few individuals engaged in reckless behavior, such as illegal motor racing and fireworks, they represented a small minority. Thus, it can be argued that sporting events effectively reignite a sense of love and responsibility among citizens.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only a powerful means of easing tensions between nations but also a catalyst for expressing patriotic emotions in a constructive way. Therefore, I advocate for hosting major sports events more frequently in the future.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;In numerous countries, children are educated from a young age to be independent and accountable for their actions. Parents often encourage them to take on jobs to help them learn responsibility. However, some individuals argue that this approach is not beneficial for education. From my perspective, the advantages of children participating in paid work far outweigh the disadvantages.To begin with, engaging in paid work provides children with insight into the challenges of earning money. By taking on tasks like babysitting, household chores, or assisting in shops, they gain valuable life experience and skills that contribute to their maturity and ability to navigate various real-life situations. As a result, they are more likely to appreciate their parents' efforts, respect the value of money, and develop healthy saving habits.Furthermore, when children hold jobs, they tend to become more responsible, as their ability to earn money depends on their work ethic and attitude. To retain their positions, they must exert effort to fulfill their responsibilities. For example, a child working as a shop assistant must monitor inventory, accurately calculate prices, and take responsibility for any losses.Some may contend that such work could lead children to become materialistic, neglect their studies in pursuit of money, or fall victim to exploitation by employers. However, if children receive proper guidance and support from their parents, they can leverage their work experiences to learn valuable lessons and avoid negative paths.In conclusion, when children engage in paid work with parental consent, they can acquire meaningful lessons that foster maturity and responsibility. I suggest that parents assist their children in selecting appropriate jobs that do not interfere with their education, and that governments implement effective policies to prevent the exploitation of child labor.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;"In recent years, taking a gap year or two before embarking on university studies has become an increasingly popular trend among students. This practice is no longer limited to those from affluent backgrounds; students from all financial situations are opting for a break. During this time, some choose to travel the globe, while others may decide to enter the workforce.The experiences gained from traveling to diverse locations and interacting with a variety of people, as well as from work, can be invaluable. Such experiences not only boost a student's confidence but also foster independence. Students who work during their time off often accumulate financial resources that can support them throughout their university years. Additionally, this time allows them to reflect and gain clarity on their future aspirations, broadening their perspectives and helping them make informed decisions regarding their academic paths.However, taking a break does come with potential downsides. Once students begin earning an income, they may become hesitant to return to a study routine that could jeopardize their financial independence. They might also find the transition back to an academic environment challenging. There's a risk that some may never return to pursue higher education, opting instead for short-term courses that offer immediate employment opportunities. While these may provide some short-lived benefits, it's important to note that long-term career advancement typically requires a solid educational foundation.From my perspective, I support the idea of taking a gap year before entering higher education. Students who engage in travel or work during their break gain valuable insights and experiences that enhance their maturity and contributions in an academic setting."
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;In today’s fast-paced and competitive world, it's clear that acquiring a wealth of knowledge and skills is essential for achieving success and standing out. Many believe that this knowledge is predominantly gained through formal education in academic institutions, and I agree with this perspective to some extent. However, I also believe that individuals can achieve success without attending university.Firstly, it is undeniable that a university education is crucial for certain professions, such as doctors, engineers, and lawyers. Without the appropriate training and expertise, it would be challenging for these professionals to excel in their careers. Moreover, university provides a valuable environment for sharing knowledge and building networks, which can be advantageous when they later seek to establish their own businesses or practices.Conversely, there are numerous individuals who have achieved remarkable success without a university education. Many entrepreneurs rely heavily on hard work and sometimes a bit of luck. For instance, Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell, dropped out of college at 19 to start his computer business from his dormitory. He eventually grew his enterprise with his earnings and financial support from his family.Additionally, individuals with innate talents are often able to succeed in their chosen fields without formal education. This is particularly evident in areas like entertainment and sports. The rise of reality television has given many talented individuals a platform to showcase their abilities. A prime example is David Archuleta, who went from being relatively unknown to winning the hearts of many through his remarkable singing talent. Thus, it’s clear that those with natural gifts also have significant opportunities for success.In conclusion, while university education plays a vital role in an individual's path to prosperity, it would be misleading to claim that success hinges solely on formal education. Personal talent and dedicated effort also play crucial roles in achieving one’s goals.
100;People should be allowed to continue to work for as long as they want to, and not forced to retire at a particular age such as 60 or 65. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society. Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.First and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.Apart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.Admittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.In conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.;The age at which individuals should retire is a topic of considerable debate in contemporary society. While some argue for the freedom to choose one's retirement age, others disagree. In my view, a retirement age of around 60 is appropriate. I strongly believe that establishing an age threshold for retirement is essential, and I will outline several reasons to support this argument below.Firstly, if older workers remain prevalent in the workforce, job opportunities for recent graduates will decline. Consequently, many graduates may be compelled to pursue careers far removed from their field of study. For instance, a medical graduate might feel disheartened if, after dedicating five years to studying medicine, they must take on a different job due to insufficient opportunities in healthcare. This lack of alignment with their passions can lead to decreased motivation and lower performance in their work.Moreover, not all senior employees are in optimal health. As individuals age, they face an increased risk of experiencing a variety of health issues, including stress-related conditions and cardiovascular diseases. For example, the demanding life of an aging teacher can significantly impact their well-being. As a result, they may struggle to perform at their best, leading to higher healthcare costs for their employers, such as schools. Thus, it would benefit organizations to allow younger individuals the chance to step in and take on these roles.That said, the expertise of retired senior workers should not be overlooked. Their extensive knowledge and experience in fields like engineering, medicine, and law can provide significant value to younger professionals. Therefore, it would be wise for retirees to engage with current employees through regular mentoring sessions, allowing them to share insights and bridge the generational gap.In conclusion, establishing a retirement age is crucial. There comes a point when the older generation needs to pass the baton to eager newcomers who are ready to prove themselves. Ultimately, retirement signifies not only the end of one chapter but also the opportunity for individuals to reclaim aspects of their lives that may have been set aside during their careers.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";"I believe that public museums and art galleries will continue to be essential, despite the availability of artworks and historical artifacts online. Today, many people favor using the Internet for exploring art because it offers great convenience; we can view collections from around the globe right from our homes. However, experiencing art online often lacks the profound spiritual connection that comes from seeing the pieces in person, as the images are constrained by screen size. In contrast, museum exhibits are life-sized, allowing visitors to engage with them on a more intimate level. For instance, only by seeing an actual mummy can one truly appreciate its mystique.To enhance visitors' understanding of the exhibits, museums organize a variety of activities that allow participants to engage directly with what they're experiencing. At the American Museum of Natural History, for example, you can create a bone-by-bone replica of a stegosaurus, while at the Museum of Art in New York, you can explore 17th-century instruments while listening to their accompanying music. Such interactive experiences are unavailable when ""visiting"" a museum online.Viewing art on a computer screen cannot compare to seeing it in person. For example, you miss out on the texture of the artwork, which is crucial for analyzing the artist's technique. Furthermore, not all details may be accurately represented on a screen; lower resolution can obscure important aspects, hindering one’s understanding of the artwork or historical objects.In summary, I maintain that museums and art galleries remain vital, but integrating technology can enhance visitors' experiences by providing additional information about artworks and historical artifacts."
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;Courts in many countries provide juries with a defendant's history, with the exception of the UK and Australia. The common belief that juries should have access to all information about a suspect has led some lawyers to challenge the existing rules in these two nations. Many individuals believe that past behavior is a strong indicator of future actions, which arguably supports the notion of sharing a defendant's record with the jury. It is important to recognize that having comprehensive information about a defendant's history enables jury members to form a complete understanding of the individual’s character. Additionally, a past record may be significant in assessing a person's likelihood of committing certain serious crimes, such as kidnapping or murder.However, for the jury to reach an impartial verdict that is not influenced by previous behavior, it is crucial for the court to present only information pertinent to the specific case at hand. For example, a defendant with multiple prior convictions may face a higher likelihood of being found guilty compared to someone with a clean or minor criminal record. Innocent defendants could suffer unjust outcomes and be penalized for past indiscretions that are unrelated to the current charges.In summary, I am wary of the practice of disclosing a defendant's history to the jury, as it raises the risk of subjective and potentially erroneous verdicts. Therefore, I strongly support the existing laws in Great Britain and Australia and advocate for maintaining regulations that keep juries uninformed about prior actions.
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;"In recent decades, technological advancements have significantly transformed the educational landscape, allowing university lecturers to share their lessons online for the benefit of students. This shift has led to a decrease in direct interactions between educators and learners. Nevertheless, the influence of the Internet on education remains a compelling topic that has ignited considerable debate among educators. Personally, I am convinced that the Internet will create a more accessible and convenient learning experience.Firstly, the Internet serves as an invaluable source of academic information that can meet the needs of university students. Today, lectures can not only be found online, but students also have access to reference e-books and various multi-faceted documents available on the Internet. As a result, the online realm has become the largest virtual library in existence. Moreover, the Internet eliminates barriers of distance and time, enabling college students to efficiently find necessary information online instead of spending hours navigating bookstores or libraries. Additionally, the Internet provides a more effective and practical means of studying. Virtual flowcharts and animations can clarify complex scientific concepts, while platforms like Google and Wikipedia are always available for detailed answers to any inquiries.In the near future, the Internet will become an essential component of academic training due to its substantial benefits. Have you ever imagined attending a lecture given by a renowned speaker in Finland from the comfort of your own home? This once fantastical notion is now a reality, thanks to advances in technology and the Internet.While critics may point out the potential drawbacks of the Internet, such as misuse and exposure to harmful content, it is essential to recognize that these issues often stem from students' improper use of the Internet rather than from the technology itself. Therefore, the focus should be on changing learners’ attitudes towards the Internet, rather than considering its removal from academic settings.After assessing both perspectives, I want to emphasize the significance of the Internet in the learning process. It is clear that the advantages of the Internet far outweigh its drawbacks. Ultimately, it’s not merely a question of whether it helps or hinders education; it’s about how we choose to use these online resources. It is crucial to approach the Internet thoughtfully and responsibly."
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;Currently, many patients in low-income countries are dying not from severe diseases, but from a lack of access to medications. It is proposed that pharmaceutical companies in wealthier nations should lower their prices to prevent these unnecessary fatalities.Undoubtedly, effective medications can save more lives. However, the pharmaceutical sector in developing countries struggles to produce high-quality drugs. The advanced technologies and innovations in the developed world have led to significant advancements in pharmaceuticals that can treat various serious conditions. If individuals in poorer nations could access these medications, their health outcomes could improve markedly. Thus, lowering medication prices would be a humanitarian gesture.On the other hand, the current pricing of medicines is justified by their effectiveness. The research, development, and mass production of drugs involve substantial financial investments, and these medications are essential for ensuring public health. If companies were compelled to reduce drug prices, they might face financial instability or even bankruptcy due to production costs exceeding revenue. Consequently, this approach is not practical and lacks long-term viability.Fortunately, alternative strategies exist to address this issue. Governments could support local pharmaceutical production by providing land for factories and offering tax incentives. Additionally, charitable organizations can procure medicines from developed countries and distribute them for free in underserved regions.In summary, I oppose the idea of lowering drug prices, as it could compromise quality. Instead, governments and health organizations should focus on facilitating access to medications in developing countries at fair prices.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;Increasing public awareness of the dangers of smoking has led to considerable pressure on both government and private sectors. In response, many companies have banned smoking on their premises, and several governments have imposed restrictions on smoking in public spaces. This shift is widely seen as beneficial for public health and the overall image of a nation in the long run.First and foremost, it is well-established and clinically validated that smoking poses severe risks not only to the smoker but also to those exposed to the smoke over time. Recent statistics released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health indicate that lung-related diseases caused by smoking are among the leading causes of death. A significant number of these fatalities involve secondhand smoke, particularly affecting vulnerable populations such as young children and pregnant women. Therefore, implementing a complete ban on public smoking could lead to a substantial decrease in mortality rates.Moreover, enforcing restrictions on public smoking can enhance a nation’s image as a healthy society through strict penalties for offenders. For example, the Brunei government recently enacted a law that prohibits smoking in public places like cafés, hospitals, and shopping areas. This initiative has led to a decline in the number of smokers in the country and has helped Brunei maintain its reputation for tranquility and cleanliness. This case serves as a testament to the positive effects of limiting public smoking on national well-being.In conclusion, efforts to ban smoking in public areas play a crucial role in reducing health risks and fostering a healthier nation. It is hoped that more businesses and government entities will adopt similar measures for the benefit of both the populace and the country as a whole.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";"The phrase ""Save the planet Earth"" is widely recognized and echoed around the globe. Numerous initiatives have emerged to protect our planet from unchecked human development. While some argue that these advancements enhance our comfort, the imperative to safeguard Earth is critical for several reasons.First, the rapid expansion of infrastructure is leading to significant deforestation worldwide. The rise of so-called ""concrete jungles"" poses a serious threat to both forests and wildlife. Trees play a crucial role in producing life-sustaining oxygen by converting harmful carbon dioxide. Additionally, wildlife is essential for maintaining ecological balance on our planet.Second, the substantial emissions of carbon monoxide from refrigerants, such as air conditioners, have contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer. The importance of the ozone layer is underscored by its role in shielding us from harmful ultraviolet rays. Furthermore, the excessive carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles globally have led to rising temperatures at the North Pole, resulting in the gradual melting of glaciers and rising sea levels.Finally, both industrial and domestic waste generated daily are severely polluting our planet. For example, a significant volume of unnoticed industrial waste discharged into oceans has disastrous effects on aquatic life. The harmful chemicals in this waste can be lethal to countless marine creatures inhabiting our oceans and rivers.In conclusion, Earth is our home, and it must be protected. Human activities that harm the planet should be curtailed, and alternative methods should be developed to mitigate this damage. We should encourage innovative solutions that minimize our environmental footprint while maintaining our quality of life."
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The debate over whether businesses should set the retirement age at fifty-five to create more job opportunities for younger workers has become contentious. Some argue that this initiative would effectively support the youth, while others disagree.There are valid points to consider in favor of encouraging workers to retire at fifty-five to open up positions for younger job seekers. Firstly, recent graduates often bring fresh ideas and skills that align with the current demands of organizations, having been educated with the latest knowledge at universities. Secondly, a workforce with a greater number of young employees can improve overall effectiveness and efficiency. Generally, younger workers tend to be more physically capable and energetic, allowing them to handle demanding workloads and meet tight deadlines.On the other hand, pushing senior employees out of the workforce to benefit younger workers can have significant downsides. On a personal level, it creates a sense of unfairness between older and younger generations. Everyone within a business should have the right to continue working as long as they are qualified, regardless of their age. From a societal standpoint, mandating early retirement could place a considerable financial burden on local governments. For instance, sufficient pension payments and healthcare must be provided for senior citizens forced into early retirement.In conclusion, while implementing an early retirement policy may have its advantages, it risks fostering discrimination between age groups and placing additional financial strain on government resources.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;"Today, one of the most debated topics regarding mass media is the appropriate level of regulatory oversight for newspapers, television, and websites. Some argue that the government should impose fewer restrictions on the dissemination of media information to the public. However, I firmly believe that it should increase oversight to safeguard the public from inappropriate content and unsuitable foreign influences.A compelling reason for stricter media regulation is the need to limit violent and sexual content, which can have a profound impact on young people during their formative years. For instance, an internet cartoon called ""Happy Tree"" features graphic violence, often depicting characters having their heads or limbs violently torn off. Additionally, television networks frequently import foreign programs that may introduce ideas not in line with local cultural values. For example, a few years ago, a Japanese game show involved contestants throwing cream pies at each other, which raises environmental concerns.The primary counterargument is the necessity of ensuring citizens' safety. It is crucial for the government to provide timely information to the media, especially during emergencies and outbreaks of new diseases. The SARS outbreak in 2003 serves as a stark example, as the Chinese government's restrictions on information access contributed to numerous fatalities. Nevertheless, it can also be argued that withholding information may help prevent unnecessary panic and anxiety among the populace.Both sides of this debate have valid points. In my opinion, while prioritizing citizens' safety is important, the government should still regulate excessive violent and sexual content and censor culturally inappropriate material. Establishing a council to oversee media content could be a practical solution."
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;The responsibilities of citizenship spark a heated debate globally. Some argue that paying taxes is the sole duty of citizens, while others contend that being a member of society entails broader obligations.Taxes are essential for funding a country's operations and are particularly vital for developing nations. When citizens pay their taxes, they actively participate in their nation's growth and economic development, thereby fulfilling their responsibility as citizens.However, many believe that citizens have additional responsibilities beyond tax payments. For a country to progress, individuals must adhere to the laws established by the government. This adherence helps decrease crime rates and fosters a peaceful society, which in turn promotes rapid development. Moreover, citizens play a role in preserving their country’s culture and history. It is crucial for individuals to be informed about their cultural heritage, which can be achieved through focused education or reading. Additionally, fostering connections within the community is vital for national development. Strong bonds among community members create a harmonious environment where support and collaboration flourish.In conclusion, I firmly believe that citizenship encompasses a range of responsibilities beyond simply paying taxes. To truly contribute to society, individuals must engage in various activities that strengthen their community.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;One of the most pressing issues related to animal rights today is the practice of animal experimentation. Numerous medical advancements, including treatments for cancer and HIV, have emerged from testing conducted on animals. While many scientists argue that this practice is essential for enhancing human health, I believe that primates deserve the same rights as humans.There are several compelling reasons to ban animal testing. Firstly, the drawbacks significantly outweigh any potential benefits. Each year, millions of animals are killed by cosmetic companies, farms, and medical schools for product testing, often without yielding any positive outcomes. The financial burden of animal testing is substantial, considering the costs associated with feeding, caring for, and administering drugs or experimental substances to these animals.Secondly, animals are often subjected to unnatural living conditions. Recent investigations have shown that many animals are neglected and mistreated, which can adversely affect their reactions to drugs. A notable case occurred in March 2003 when a lab technician recorded footage of primates housed in cages without pain relief, including one baboon with a metal cylinder implanted in its skull. As a result, I believe that the practice of sacrificing animals is both costly and inhumane.Additionally, there is a strong ethical argument against animal testing, as it violates numerous moral and genetic principles. Many people contend that inflicting suffering on animals is not only cruel but also misleading, given that responses to medications can vary significantly between animals and humans. Personally, I assert that humans lack the moral authority to exploit animals in ways that do not yield benefits for the individual.For these reasons, I maintain that animal testing produces no clear advantages and should, therefore, be made illegal.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";"Examinations are a prevalent method for assessing learning across educational systems worldwide. At nearly every level of the educational journey, exams serve as a checkpoint to determine if students are prepared to advance. Nonetheless, there is a growing belief that the function of exams should be reevaluated.Exams offer notable benefits; they promote fairness by providing consistent conditions for all test-takers. They are also adaptable; various question formats—such as multiple-choice and essay questions—can evaluate different types of reasoning skills. However, there are significant drawbacks. Some students may excel in exams due to test-taking strategies rather than genuine understanding or capability. Conversely, others may struggle to perform well due to test anxiety. This focus often leads both teachers and students to concentrate narrowly on the aspects of the curriculum that are likely to appear on tests, thereby limiting the overall educational experience.To address these issues, several steps should be implemented. Whenever possible, exams should align closely with the subject matter and activities of the learning environment. Exam tasks should be diverse to provide equitable opportunities for candidates with varying skill sets. It is also important to consider alternative assessment methods, such as written assignments to evaluate independent research skills or group projects to assess teamwork abilities.In summary, while exams play a crucial role in providing an objective measure of achievement, they must be thoughtfully designed and complemented by other assessment methods to become a truly effective element of the education system."
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;Improvements in health, education, and trade are crucial for the development of less affluent nations. These countries require assistance from wealthier nations to progress in these vital areas.Firstly, regarding health, poorer nations typically have a significantly lower number of doctors and nurses compared to their wealthier counterparts. The high population density in these countries, often exacerbated by inadequate family planning, has led to a disproportionate ratio of healthcare professionals to residents. Additionally, there is often a shortage of hospitals to meet patient demand. Wealthier nations can help alleviate these challenges by sending medical professionals to assist in these countries and providing financial support to build healthcare facilities.Secondly, in terms of education, it is widely acknowledged that poorer nations frequently face a lack of qualified teachers in schools and lecturers in higher education institutions. Moreover, education in these regions is often not free, limiting access for many students. To address the shortage of educational personnel, wealthier nations can send experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Furthermore, to tackle the issue of educational costs, they should offer scholarships and loans to deserving students.Lastly, in the realm of trade, it is evident that poorer countries struggle to compete with wealthier nations due to financial constraints. Inactive trade levels are often compounded by inadequate transportation infrastructure. For instance, many residents in rural areas rely solely on subsistence farming for their food supply. As a goodwill gesture, wealthier nations can provide financial services to stimulate trade in poorer countries and offer guidance on establishing comprehensive and efficient transportation networks to support economic activities.In conclusion, wealthier nations have a responsibility to assist poorer nations in the areas of health, education, and trade. Enhancements in these sectors will lead to improved living conditions for residents in less affluent countries, enabling them to contribute to the development of their own communities.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;In recent years, the integration of technology in education has become increasingly prevalent. However, I contend that this surge in technological advancements will not revolutionize the education system by substituting teachers with computers.There are several compelling reasons why teachers will always be irreplaceable. Firstly, computers require human operation. It's undeniable that technological tools have become essential in today’s classrooms. For instance, lessons become more engaging and comprehensible when presented through PowerPoint and displayed with an LCD projector. Nonetheless, research shows that every classroom necessitates trained educators to effectively utilize these interactive teaching methods. While I believe that the learning experience is significantly enhanced by computers, they are merely instruments for teachers and cannot function optimally without human guidance.Secondly, children thrive on human interaction. Regardless of technological advancements, it’s evident that a computer cannot truly engage with its students. As highlighted in a recent interview with Josh Trumm, the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group,' genuine human interactions are irreplaceable: “The verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and students is fundamental to effective education. Without someone who can explain and empathize with their challenges, students cannot truly learn.” I fully support this perspective, as only a teacher can forge connections with students, providing friendship and guidance.In conclusion, a school cannot exist without teachers. I believe that while computers will continue to play a role in the educational process, they will never replace the unique value that teachers bring. They are not only educators but also friends and mentors to their students.
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;In recent years, the debate surrounding agricultural development has become contentious. While some believe that advanced plant foods and innovative technologies significantly lower the costs of producing agricultural goods, others contend that this integration has detrimental effects on both public health and society.On one hand, the use of advanced fertilizers in conjunction with automated harvesting technologies boosts farmers' profits. This is largely due to artificial fertilizers enhancing the productivity of farmland, while machinery improves harvesting efficiency. As a result, the production and labor costs per kilogram of agricultural products are significantly reduced.However, high-tech fertilizers pose potential health risks. Unlike organic fertilizers, industrial fertilizers are composed of synthetic chemicals that can alter crop genetics and remain within the plants. Consequently, consumers who regularly consume these treated products may face a range of health issues over time.Furthermore, excessive dependence on automated equipment for harvesting has societal implications. One major concern is the increase in air pollution due to excessive emissions from machinery, whereas manual harvesting is less harmful to the environment. Additionally, the rise of mechanical harvesting can lead to higher unemployment rates in the agricultural sector, as sophisticated machinery can replace many field workers.In conclusion, despite the financial gains that advanced plant foods and machinery bring to farmers, it is clear that the drawbacks associated with these developments in the agricultural sector cannot be ignored.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;In today's world, as governments strive to minimize expenses and bolster their economies, there is a growing notion that funding for artists should be curtailed in favor of more essential areas like medical research and space exploration. However, I strongly oppose this viewpoint for several reasons.Firstly, government support for the arts significantly enhances the quality of life and boosts tourism. Iconic monuments and artworks not only embody the history and culture of a city but also enhance its beauty, making it more appealing to visitors. In fact, many countries rely heavily on tourism as a primary source of income, making it essential for governments to invest in the arts, which play a crucial role in attracting tourists.Moreover, sculptures and paintings found in museums and galleries serve as vital reflections of a nation’s culture and civilization. They preserve and promote a country’s heritage, allowing younger generations to learn about their history and cultural identity through exposure to various artistic expressions.Additionally, artistic talent is a rare and valuable gift that should be nurtured rather than sidelined. Few individuals possess such skills in painting and craftsmanship, and this talent deserves the same recognition and support as other forms of expertise, such as those found in science or literature.In conclusion, art holds immense value for any nation, and such talent is not easily found elsewhere. Therefore, I believe that governments should actively support and promote artists to ensure their continued contribution to society.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;It is undeniable that advancements in technology contribute to environmental challenges. Some believe that embracing a simpler lifestyle and forgoing technological conveniences could address these issues, while others argue that only further technological innovation can provide solutions. In the following paragraphs, I will explore both perspectives.Proponents of a simpler life argue that to protect the environment, humanity must reduce its reliance on technology. They contend that the luxuries afforded by modern technology are the root cause of environmental harm. By eliminating the use of air conditioners, cars, and other technological advancements, they claim we could significantly decrease pollution and conserve natural resources like fossil fuels, ultimately benefiting the environment.Conversely, there are those who assert that technology is the key to environmental preservation. They believe that given our current technological advancements, it is unrealistic to expect society to revert to a simpler, pre-industrial age. Instead, they argue that the innovations we have made are essential for our future.Numerous technological developments are currently addressing environmental concerns. For example, innovative solutions for water scarcity in developing regions, such as Africa, hold great promise. By applying pressure to seawater to create vapor jets and then filtering these through carbon nanotubes, we can generate clean drinking water from the abundant resource of seawater. Additionally, Japan is aiming to establish a functioning solar power system in space by 2030. Harnessing the immense energy from the sun could potentially meet global electricity needs indefinitely, without relying on nuclear power or emitting greenhouse gases. If successful, this breakthrough could lead to a tremendous global impact, providing energy to schools, hospitals, and homes and ushering in a new industrial revolution.In summary, I conclude by asserting that technology is pivotal in addressing the world's environmental challenges. We are on the brink of a transformative era where engineering and technological advancements are poised to improve our planet. It would be impractical to strive for a simpler lifestyle when the potential for progress through technology is so significant.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;Some people argue that professional athletes and entertainers receive reasonable salaries, which can reach millions of dollars annually. However, this compensation does not reflect their actual contributions to society. I believe their salaries should be lower in comparison to those in scientific or social and economic sectors.Firstly, advocates for high salaries for athletes and entertainers contend that these individuals possess exceptional talents that set them apart from the general population. For instance, few can play basketball with the same skill as Michael Jordan, the legendary former NBA player with multiple championship titles. Supporters also emphasize the rigorous training and numerous competitions these figures endure to achieve recognition and success. Moreover, while many aspire to be singers or athletes, only a select few attain fame and victory. Given the challenges they overcome, proponents argue that their earning potential should be substantial.Nevertheless, such talents should not be overly glorified. Critics argue that singers and athletes contribute relatively little to societal advancement. Their impressive performances primarily offer aesthetic and entertainment value. In contrast, scientists innovate technologies that enhance our daily lives, doctors heal and care for patients, and law enforcement maintains national safety and stability. While entertainers do provide relaxation and enjoyment, their role is less critical than those of doctors or scientists. Therefore, the justification for their high salaries seems unwarranted, especially while essential workers earn modest wages that barely cover their basic needs.In conclusion, based on the analysis presented, professional athletes and entertainers are overcompensated relative to their societal contributions. I believe that a reassessment of their salaries is necessary to create a fairer balance with those in fields like science and social services, who are truly essential to the well-being and progress of the nation.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;As technological advancements continue to rise rapidly, many believe that the Internet and computers may eventually replace the traditional role of teachers in the near future. This perspective brings forth two main viewpoints, each with its own set of arguments. Supporters of this idea argue that the global online network serves as an endless reservoir of information, surpassing the knowledge any experienced teacher can possess. Moreover, the Internet and computers provide a broader range of learning experiences, incorporating various visual and auditory stimuli, which can make education particularly enjoyable for children.Conversely, critics assert that while the Internet offers undeniable educational benefits, it also has significant limitations. Despite the vast amount of information available online, many sources are not validated by experts, raising questions about their reliability. Although computers can indicate whether an answer is correct or incorrect, they lack the ability to provide the in-depth explanations that a human teacher can offer. Additionally, through face-to-face interaction, teachers can identify individual student weaknesses and adapt their teaching methods to meet each student's needs—a task at which computers fall short.In conclusion, while both sides present compelling arguments, I believe that although the Internet can be a valuable educational resource, it will never wholly replace the irreplaceable role of human teachers.
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";"The issue of capital punishment is a contentious one in many nations. In a world where serious crimes need to be deterred, some argue that the death penalty serves as an effective means of retribution against violence. However, as society evolves, respect for human rights increases, making the idea of ""killing"" criminals morally objectionable and difficult to accept.Firstly, it is fundamental to recognize that every individual has a right to life, and no authority should have the power to take that away. While the actions of criminals can deeply harm society, particularly their victims, they remain human beings whose lives deserve consideration. Additionally, executing someone does not erase the aftermath of their crimes and can inflict further suffering on the criminal's family, all while the pain of the victims' loved ones endures without solace.Secondly, capital punishment is not the sole solution to crime reduction; life imprisonment serves just as effectively by keeping offenders incarcerated for life. Moreover, from a punitive perspective, enduring a grim existence confined to a small cell and grappling with guilt day after day can be far more torturous than facing immediate death.Lastly, there is always the risk of innocent individuals being wrongfully convicted. Jurors are human and can exercise poor judgment. Consequently, some people are executed for crimes they did not commit, raising serious concerns about the fairness of the judicial process.In summary, while capital punishment may act as a severe deterrent, I firmly oppose it as it is both irrational and inhumane. It can easily be substituted with a life sentence instead."
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;There is no doubt that companies, factories, and businesses are established to meet people's needs and generate profits for their owners. However, I firmly oppose the notion that businesses should have the freedom to do anything necessary to achieve those profits. Such freedom could enable them to harm the environment and society in their pursuit of profit.Firstly, without any oversight, businesses allowed to operate unchecked could pose a serious threat to all forms of life, including humans, animals, and plants. Daily, we hear reports in the news about factories polluting the environment with toxic waste.Additionally, if businesses are given free rein to maximize profits, they may resort to producing low-quality products at high prices, negatively impacting consumers. A recent example highlights this issue: a few months ago, news outlets reported that a company selling baby formula did so without ensuring its quality, resulting in tragic outcomes for several infants.In conclusion, it is essential for governments and regulatory bodies to monitor all companies, factories, and businesses closely. They should not be permitted to act solely in the name of profit, as this can lead to devastating consequences for both the environment and human life.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;While some of my neighbors may disagree, I wholeheartedly support the idea of building a new high school in our community. This new facility would offer numerous benefits, especially considering that our current high school is quite outdated and lacks essential resources for students, hindering their educational experience. I truly believe that a new high school would greatly enhance the educational landscape of our area.Firstly, the new high school will provide invaluable opportunities for students focused on their education. The current school is in dire need of updated educational materials, repairs to sports facilities, and improvements to the physics and chemistry laboratories, which are currently in poor condition. With a new environment, students will approach their studies with renewed vigor and enthusiasm.Secondly, the new high school will serve as a hub for building connections among students from various communities and districts within the city. After classes, students—along with members of the community—will gather in the high school for various events and competitions. For example, during sports matches, students from different high schools will come together, fostering relationships that can continue beyond the competitions. While the noise generated by these events may disturb some nearby residents, I believe this is a minor issue compared to the benefits of increased social interaction.In conclusion, the construction of a new high school offers many advantages, including fostering connections between students across various communities and equipping them with the tools they need to engage more enthusiastically in their studies. The only potential drawback is the noise from competitions, which I consider a minor concern. Overall, I am confident that a new high school would be a fantastic addition to our community.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;It may appear that teenagers, especially those aged 15 to 18, are fully matured and capable of making important decisions independently. However, I believe that they actually require more support and guidance than older individuals. I will outline my perspective in two main areas.Firstly, it is undeniable that parents and other adult relatives possess more life experience, making them the best advisors for their children. Having navigated a variety of situations, their insights can help prevent teenagers from making detrimental choices. By heeding their advice, young people can avoid costly mistakes, saving both time and money, and ultimately enjoy life more fully.Additionally, I firmly believe that parents and adult relatives serve as the best friends and counselors for teenagers. Regrettably, there are individuals in society who exploit and deceive others for personal gain. They often target younger individuals, assuming that their immaturity makes them easier to manipulate.In conclusion, while everyone, regardless of age, has the right to make their own decisions, it is wise for young individuals to seek advice from parents and adult relatives in order to sidestep potential challenges.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;It's rare to find someone who claims to have had an unhappy childhood. When people reflect on their past, they often recall various events from their formative years. Even the more challenging experiences typically take on a sweeter tone in adulthood. In my view, childhood truly represents the happiest period of a person's life for two main reasons.First and foremost, children enjoy a remarkable level of freedom. They can pursue their interests without many restrictions and rarely face limitations. As they grow, they are encouraged to explore, which means they often encounter new experiences without the threat of punishment or argument.Additionally, children are not burdened with responsibilities. They aren’t expected to work or study in the same way adults do, allowing them plenty of time to relish this stage of life. Personally, I made a host of friends during my childhood and traveled extensively throughout my country while I was still in kindergarten. I also learned about various animals and plants during that time.In conclusion, I firmly believe that childhood is the most wonderful phase of life. Children are free to explore and enjoy life without constraints or punishments, and they have ample time to seek out new experiences that bring them joy.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;For centuries, universities have played a pivotal role in shaping individuals' lives. People enroll in university for a variety of reasons, but I believe the three most significant are the pursuit of knowledge, preparation for a career, and the chance to have new experiences.To begin with, many view university as an ideal environment for enhancing their understanding. In this enriching academic setting, students are exposed to a vast array of information provided by knowledgeable professors and experienced educators. Consequently, individuals can deepen their knowledge base and critical thinking skills. Additionally, with access to resources like laboratories and libraries, students can engage in research across various academic fields, allowing them to gain profound insights into their subjects of study.Furthermore, attending university signifies a significant transition in one’s life, filled with new experiences. The sheer number of individuals enrolled in university surpasses that of any previous educational institution. This provides students with an incredible opportunity to forge diverse and lasting relationships with peers from different parts of the country and even the globe. For example, my brother is studying at an international university with a multicultural community that includes students from Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, and more. He has expressed excitement about this new environment, highlighting it as one of his main reasons for pursuing higher education.Lastly, preparing for a career is a fundamental aspect of the university experience. In addition to completing coursework and attending classes, students are encouraged to engage in volunteer work, internships, and part-time jobs. These activities allow them to gain real-world experience and clarify their career aspirations. Ultimately, they learn where to focus their efforts to attain their professional goals.In conclusion, individuals may attend university for diverse reasons, whether it’s to embrace new experiences, prepare for a future career, or expand their knowledge. Regardless of their motivations, all students should prioritize their objectives and strive to make the most of their university experience.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;"There’s no need to highlight the benefits of having numerous casual acquaintances, but I do believe that having one or two close friends is preferable to a large circle of acquaintances. The distinction between a friend and an acquaintance is significant. Making real friends can be challenging; true friendship often arises from deep compatibility between individuals. After spending two years in college, I’ve realized that, at times, differences among people can outweigh their similarities, shaped by varied upbringings and experiences. Consequently, some acquaintances remain just that. We may spend time together, but that doesn't necessarily translate into friendship. Thus, it’s generally easier to have a few casual acquaintances than to cultivate close friendships.Furthermore, true friends possess an innate ability to understand each other’s feelings. The understanding that comes from shared experiences and similarities allows friends to empathize more deeply than acquaintances can. Often, acquaintances may be polite but not genuinely concerned about your feelings. While being friendly is appropriate for casual interactions, it’s not sufficient for deep friendships. For example, when my friend is unwell, I won’t simply ask if they’re okay like an acquaintance might; I will do everything I can to help them recover. If my friend makes a poor life choice, I won't just watch passively; I'll intervene because their well-being matters to me, and I trust they would do the same for me. In summary, a true friend is someone you genuinely care about. For me, friends are among the most important people in my life, second only to my family. I tend to have only one or two close friends, and I am completely satisfied with that. If given the choice between my friends and a multitude of acquaintances, I would certainly choose my friends."
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";"Life today is drastically different from what it was just fifty years ago. While technological advancements have certainly helped humanity tackle numerous challenges, they have also stripped away certain aspects of our lives that we once valued. I believe that life in the past offered more happiness than it does today for several reasons.Firstly, life was simpler in earlier times. Today, we are all in a constant competition with one another. As the global population continues to grow, the competition becomes increasingly intense. If someone struggles to perform their job, there is always another person ready to take their place. This pressure forces individuals to exert much more effort just to maintain their living standards. In contrast, life back then was less complicated.Secondly, the current state of our environment is severely damaged. When I look out the window, I don’t see the sky, trees, or mountains; instead, I’m faced with cold, towering buildings. I walk on hard pavement, breathe in polluted air, and reside in constricted spaces. What’s more, research has shown that living under such conditions can lead to various mental health issues. In comparison, the environment in which our grandparents lived was much more comfortable and serene.Lastly, the pace of life has accelerated dramatically. Today, we have access to news from around the world, the ability to connect with others via the Internet, and the means to travel globally by airplane. However, this also means that events happening elsewhere can directly impact our lives. If we fail to respond swiftly and appropriately, we find ourselves in vulnerable situations. We are forced to navigate a fast-paced existence.In conclusion, while some individuals may enjoy relatively good living conditions, they represent a minority. Society has become overly focused on wealth accumulation and technological progress. Yet, behind this glitzy exterior, we have lost much that can never be reclaimed."
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;High school is a crucial period when students begin to determine their future careers and areas of focus. I believe that high schools should allow students to choose their own courses for several compelling reasons: the freedom of choice, improved academic performance, and the opportunity for students to discover their potential.First and foremost, students should have the right to select the subjects they wish to study. Denying them this choice is a violation of their rights. As young individuals in an independent country, it's important for students to understand the rights and opportunities available to them in pursuing their goals and dreams.Additionally, allowing students to choose their classes can lead to greater academic progress and better grades. It can also minimize conflicts between students and teachers, fostering a more enjoyable and productive learning environment for everyone involved. For instance, when I took an art class, it was easy to connect with my peers because we all shared a common interest. Providing students with the chance to study subjects they are passionate about is undoubtedly beneficial.Finally, the most important reason I advocate for this approach is that it allows students to explore areas where they may have a natural aptitude. When schools offer such opportunities, students are more likely to excel and achieve success in their future endeavors, which is a primary goal of education. Moreover, this kind of environment can cultivate future leaders and innovators.In conclusion, as a young woman, I aspire for my children to pursue knowledge in areas that spark their interest, leading to remarkable achievements that benefit both individuals and society. By supporting student choice in education, we can nurture well-rounded individuals with bright and independent minds.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";The debate over whether individuals should live at a faster or slower pace is a contentious one, and its complexity allows for various perspectives. Some people are inclined to rush through their tasks, while others seem to favor a more leisurely approach. After careful consideration of this issue, I have formed my own viewpoint: I advocate for a faster pace of living.One primary reason for my preference is the necessity of managing time effectively to complete important tasks. A personal experience illustrates this point: I missed the university entrance exam because I underestimated the time needed for breakfast and travel. I became stuck in traffic and consequently missed the first test. This situation underscores the importance of being proactive in our lives.Additionally, maintaining a faster pace helps me avoid laziness. By staying active, I increase my chances of achieving my dreams. For example, I dedicated extended hours to practicing the piano, which led me to win a competition against others who practiced less. This experience highlights the importance of maintaining higher momentum.Of course, some individuals argue that a slower pace allows for greater enjoyment of life, as it frees them from the pressures of time and competition. However, I find this perspective questionable. I believe that those who experience defeat, like losing a piano competition due to a slower pace, may not find true happiness. In contrast, I derive immense joy from the success and fulfillment that comes from hard work and victory.Considering the reasons outlined, I firmly believe that living at a faster pace is advantageous, as its benefits outweigh those of a slower approach. While I acknowledge that others' perspectives may hold some validity, I am convinced that the rationale I have presented in support of a faster lifestyle is far more substantial and compelling.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;The tourism industry is increasingly recognized as a significant driver of economic growth. However, some people argue that this perspective overlooks the ecological and environmental damage caused by tourism-related activities, as well as their negative impacts on local communities and ecosystems. While both viewpoints have merit, I believe that with effective management and regulation, a thriving tourism sector can serve as a valuable source of economic development and prosperity for both urban and rural areas.One of the primary advantages of tourism is its potential to significantly enhance economic development in a specific region. This occurs not only through tourists’ direct spending but also through the creation of both direct and indirect employment opportunities in various sectors, such as retail, agriculture, and services. A well-structured tourism program leads to increased tax revenue and the growth of local markets for accommodation and luxury goods, among others. Moreover, tourism creates numerous job opportunities across different areas, from hotels and transportation to agriculture and services. As employment grows, individuals are able to contribute more significantly to society through increased consumption, driving the local economic cycle and fostering prosperity.Critics may highlight the environmental and cultural degradation associated with tourism. However, when compared to other industries like resource extraction and manufacturing, tourism often has a lesser impact on the environment. For example, industries such as paper manufacturing can release substantial amounts of pollutants into waterways, resulting in severe water contamination. Additionally, many tourists—especially those who invest time and resources to visit remote villages—are typically well-educated individuals. It is unreasonable to assume that these rational guests will behave irresponsibly when it comes to respecting the destinations they visit.After weighing both sides of the debate, it is clear that the tourism industry offers significant socioeconomic benefits. In conclusion, with appropriate oversight, the positive impacts of tourism far outweigh its potential drawbacks.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;"The allocation of government funding for aesthetic initiatives has ignited considerable debate. While some assert that budget resources devoted to the arts are a misuse of national funds, suggesting these resources would be better directed towards public services, I argue that investment in the arts serves the best interests of society.Firstly, it is undeniable that governments have a responsibility to provide effective public services and facilities. Every individual should have access to adequate care in health, education, transportation, and communication. However, these services primarily address physical needs. It is equally important for governments to consider initiatives that support mental health, which can be greatly nurtured through the arts, whether consciously or unconsciously.Moreover, the arts are instrumental in the holistic development of a society. No developed nation neglects music, painting, literature, or other artistic expressions in its governmental policies. The arts enrich lives and inspire thought, yielding numerous positive outcomes that contribute to societal progress.Additionally, investing in the arts can generate employment opportunities and sometimes lead to a return on investment. The financial returns can come from the intrinsic value of the artwork created, which should be regarded as national treasures.In conclusion, funding the arts should not be viewed as a fiscal irresponsibility; rather, it enhances cultural richness and offers diverse benefits to both governments and individuals."
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";"Since the advent of industrialization in the late 19th century, a career has become synonymous with a way of life. Traditionally, individuals often pursued a single career to earn a living. However, a contemporary trend indicates that younger generations are increasingly inclined to take on multiple jobs and seek various higher education credentials to enhance their earnings and achieve financial stability.In the past, a full-time job with a reliable income was generally sufficient for individuals to support themselves and their families. Yet, with the recent global recession, many countries are experiencing significant economic challenges. This crisis has led to workforce reductions and layoffs, prompting individuals to seek multiple job opportunities or further qualifications to bolster their financial security.Additionally, the rise of technology has played a significant role in contributing to unemployment, a phenomenon referred to as ""Technological Unemployment."" Reports from North American economists analyzing the current economic landscape indicate that technology is destroying more jobs than it creates. For instance, robots, automation, and software are increasingly taking over roles traditionally filled by human workers, including clerical positions, interpretation, security services, retail, and particularly within manufacturing. Consequently, many jobs are now at significant risk. The most effective strategy for generating flexible income is to pursue multiple job opportunities. Furthermore, corporate policies that favor lower wages for entry-level employees further motivate workers to seek positions across different sectors.In light of these factors, I believe that individuals are now more aware of the importance of acquiring additional educational qualifications and are increasingly interested in diversifying their careers by working in various fields simultaneously to improve their financial situation."
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;The computer is a contemporary tool that plays a vital role in modern life. It is utilized by individuals for various purposes, including work, education, and communication. Nonetheless, some argue that computers create more obstacles than they solve in social interactions. Others contend that computers have become essential to daily life, to the point where many feel they cannot function without them. I firmly believe that computers significantly influence society, and our lives have become increasingly reliant on these devices.I would argue that for some individuals, this modern technology can be quite detrimental. A study by Mediabank revealed that most Australian adults spend nearly nine hours a day on computers, which has led to decreased socialization with family and friends compared to the past. This statistic highlights how the potential benefits of computers are often overlooked.On the other hand, computers undeniably simplify work tasks for many people. For instance, business professionals utilize computers for presentations and to communicate with colleagues. Features such as email and the internet enable busy executives to negotiate deals and maintain relationships even when they are in different countries. This demonstrates that reliance on computers can enhance efficiency, making it challenging for many workers to perform their jobs effectively without them.In conclusion, in this technological era, computers have become an integral part of human life. Daily, people find it difficult to go through a day without using a computer. This reliance has transformed into a lifestyle habit, greatly influencing contemporary human activities.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;As the educational level of the workforce continues to rise, an increasing number of employers are beginning to prioritize criteria beyond qualifications, such as social skills, in their hiring processes. Nevertheless, some employers still contend that qualifications should remain the primary consideration. This essay will examine both perspectives while also presenting my own viewpoint.On one hand, many argue that qualifications should be the leading measure of an employee's value. It is crucial for workers, especially in professional sectors like healthcare, to possess a solid educational background and relevant experience. For instance, individuals in the medical field are mandated to hold university degrees and accumulate years of hands-on practice. In such cases, social skills may seem less critical, particularly as they do not directly influence the success of medical procedures.Conversely, an increasing number of employers are recognizing the significance of social skills. In contemporary workplaces, team collaboration is often essential, making interpersonal abilities vital for facilitating cooperation among colleagues, especially during conflicts. Strong social skills enable individuals to navigate disagreements more harmoniously. Furthermore, organizations have shifted towards a customer-centric approach. Excellent social skills can empower employees to foster robust relationships with clients, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.From my perspective, I firmly believe that qualifications remain the foundational criterion for assessing an employee's competency in their role. However, it is essential not to overlook the value of social skills, as they can significantly enhance job performance by promoting effective interaction and communication with others.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;The world has never been more prosperous, yet many individuals still endure poverty, conflict, or disasters. Charity organizations have played a crucial role in offering support to those in need. However, there is ongoing debate about whether assistance should be directed primarily to those who need it most globally or to the citizens of the country where the charities are based. I believe that international aid should take precedence.International aid is essential because individuals in other countries may be facing far more severe challenges. For instance, many people in certain African nations live well below basic standards of living. They struggle with inadequate access to food, clean water, and clothing, not to mention the lack of educational opportunities. In even more dire situations, individuals in countries afflicted by war or natural disasters face critical issues such as insecurity, homelessness, and the trauma of losing loved ones. It is evident that these individuals are in urgent need of international assistance.While addressing the needs of people beyond our borders is vital, it is also justifiable to support our fellow citizens. Charity organizations are predominantly funded by local donations, creating a strong expectation that funds should be utilized within the community from which they originate. Additionally, even in the most developed nations, there are still individuals who lack access to basic necessities. Addressing these issues within our own country can contribute to social stability and promote steady economic growth.In conclusion, those in struggling nations require significant international aid, but it is also important to assist citizens within the home country.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;"The manner in which children study today is fundamentally different from that of previous generations, largely due to the increased accessibility and relatively low cost of modern technology. While some argue that students gain more valuable knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods are equally vital in the knowledge acquisition process for children.There is no doubt that the proliferation of alternative knowledge sources has significantly contributed to students' learning. Computers can be programmed to present an endless array of questions across various subjects, allowing students to learn and reinforce facts as they respond. For instance, the reading and listening sections of the TOEFL iBT exams require candidates to answer numerous questions within a limited timeframe. Additionally, students facing academic challenges can post inquiries on websites and receive accurate answers from strangers around the world, often at no cost. In the past, research demanded countless hours spent searching library shelves; today, it can be accomplished with a simple click. Therefore, technology plays a crucial role in students' education.On the other hand, schools and universities serve as environments where students not only learn from formal educators but also engage with each other. In these institutions, experienced teachers guide students through their development step by step, ensuring a systematic approach to knowledge acquisition. Hence, formal educational methods remain indispensable.In conclusion, I assert that alternative information sources and traditional educational systems are equally important for children's development. To achieve the best learning outcomes, students should learn from both their teachers and modern technology."
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";"Global sporting events attract viewers from nearly every country, fostering social connection and community engagement. While some people see these competitions as crucial for alleviating international issues, others view them merely as entertainment meant to distract the masses. I believe they hold significance, but not in a fundamental way.In fact, world sports events create positive experiences for many individuals. The primary aim of such competitions is to bring joy and unite fans around their favorite teams, allowing them to share emotions—locally within their communities, nationally within their countries, and even internationally. These events undeniably create a sense of togetherness, igniting national pride. For instance, the football World Cup, held every four years, captivates audiences and generates excitement across the globe.However, these sporting events are not pivotal to resolving serious matters like politics or international relations. The atmosphere during these events may seem harmonious and friendly, but the underlying reality can be quite different. It can often feel like a ""calm before the storm."" Once the Olympics conclude, life resumes, and most people quickly forget about the competitions. A recent example is when Putin opened the last Winter Olympics, which seemingly brought nations together, but this was simply a façade, as he ignored international warnings following his conquest of Crimea.In conclusion, while international sports events provide a wonderful opportunity for people to come together, dream, take pride in their national identity, and escape their problems—this impact is only temporary. These gatherings do not fundamentally influence international relations or address pressing global issues."
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;With the rapid advancement of information technology, distance education has made it possible for individuals to study from home without the need to attend a physical school. The question of whether this method of teaching is more advantageous for students than traditional education has generated significant debate. I personally believe that students stand to gain more from remote learning.Firstly, studying from home enables students to save both time and money. Those enrolled in distance learning programs can significantly reduce their commuting time, tuition costs, and expenses for textbooks and other materials, all simply by having internet access. This is particularly beneficial for children living in remote rural areas or those from families struggling financially.Additionally, online education offers students access to a vast array of knowledge and diverse teaching methods. Learners can easily find curriculum materials with just a click, including scientific reports, research articles, and documentaries. Moreover, students have the freedom to choose specific online courses that align with their interests and schedules, allowing them to control their learning pace and achieve their desired outcomes.While traditional education undeniably offers advantages such as face-to-face interaction, motivational support, and physical activities, which contribute greatly to immediate feedback and personality development, advancements in streaming and sensor technology are beginning to bridge the gaps in distance learning regarding personal interaction.In conclusion, I acknowledge that traditional education has some irreplaceable benefits, such as direct feedback and inspiration. However, the merits of distance education—its efficiency, convenience, economic advantages, and the opportunity for self-directed learning—outweigh those of conventional schooling.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;Many animal species today are at risk of extinction for various reasons. While some individuals argue for the importance of protecting these endangered species, others contend that human challenges should take precedence. In my view, we should prioritize our own issues.Proponents of animal conservation often argue that biodiversity is vital for maintaining the balance of ecosystems. The absence of certain species can disrupt this balance and endanger other species, including humans. Thus, they assert it is our duty to preserve as many species as possible on Earth.However, I believe that species extinction is a natural part of evolution. The Earth’s environment has undergone significant changes since the emergence of the first species. Many plants and animals have gone extinct because they could not adapt to new conditions. In many instances, the extinction process is irreversible, and there is little we can do to prevent it.Additionally, humanity continues to confront pressing issues such as hunger, disease, and warfare. When these urgent matters are considered, the extinction of certain animals becomes significantly less important, and it doesn't make sense to allocate our limited resources to species that are beyond assistance. We must first ensure our own survival and well-being before focusing on the conservation of other species.In conclusion, we should place greater emphasis on human concerns rather than animal welfare, allowing nature to take its course in matters of species extinction.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;In today's world, education plays a crucial role in shaping one's future. I firmly believe that there should be no gender-based discrimination when it comes to student admissions in university courses. Several reasons support this perspective.First and foremost, a student's capabilities and talents should be assessed solely on their academic achievements and skills, rather than their gender. Nowadays, male and female students are equally competitive and both deserve recognition for their achievements across various fields of study. For instance, in India, it is common for female students to secure a greater number of top positions in higher secondary school examinations each year.Moreover, female students today show a keen interest in traditionally male-dominated fields, such as mechanical engineering, which involve hands-on work in laboratories. This marks a significant shift from previous generations. With increased awareness of current events and advances in technology, female graduates are also more prepared to take on significant responsibilities in the workplace, despite the challenges they may face. A noteworthy example is Chanda Kochhar, the CEO of ICICI Bank, who has been recognized as one of the most powerful women in the business sector in India.In conclusion, I strongly advocate that all students, regardless of gender, should have equal opportunities to pursue their education in any university subject, provided they meet the necessary qualifications. The government should implement measures to ensure a fair admission process that benefits every student.
140;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The debate over whether face-to-face communication is superior to other forms of communication is a contentious one, and its complexity allows for multiple perspectives. While some people advocate for in-person interactions as the most effective form of expression, others hold an opposing view. After reflecting on this issue, I find myself in agreement with the former stance, believing that face-to-face communication is indeed the better option.The primary reason for this belief is the undeniable fact that in-person interactions can be more persuasive. For example, I recall an incident involving my uncle, who once expressed dissatisfaction with a restaurant's service. Rather than leaving a negative review online or making a phone complaint, he approached the restaurant owner directly and explained that a fly had been found in his meal. As a result of this face-to-face communication, he received a new meal and better service. Had he chosen to complain through other means, I doubt the issue would have been taken as seriously. This illustrates that speaking directly with someone is often the most effective method of communication.Additionally, another crucial point is that without face-to-face interactions, misunderstandings can arise. For instance, I once received hurtful messages on Facebook from my best friend, Eric, who claimed I had failed at building our friendship and no longer wanted to be friends. I was shocked and confused until I discovered that his account had been hacked. This experience highlights the importance of direct communication, which can help prevent misinterpretations and clarify intentions.Of course, some may argue that communicating through letters, emails, or phone calls allows for more freedom of expression without immediate consequences. While I understand this perspective, I remain skeptical of its validity. It's essential to choose our words carefully during conversations, and speaking without restraint can often lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings.In conclusion, I prefer to communicate in person because the benefits of this approach far outweigh those of alternatives. While I acknowledge that other forms of communication have their merits, I firmly believe that the arguments supporting face-to-face interaction are more compelling and substantial.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;The advancement of technology has significantly enhanced medical care, contributing to increased life expectancy. While this rise in life expectancy does place some strain on the Medicare system, I believe the benefits of improved medical care far outweigh the drawbacks.One of the primary advantages of high-tech medical care is the enhanced health management it provides, allowing individuals to enjoy better overall health. This, in turn, enables them to contribute more effectively to the economy, as healthy workers tend to be more productive. With less time spent on health check-ups and treatments, both time and costs are saved.Moreover, a community with healthy elderly individuals plays a crucial role in the sustainable development of society. Young people benefit from having healthy parents and grandparents, fostering a sense of happiness. Thus, it can be argued that advancements in medical care lead to an improved quality of life for everyone.Conversely, some argue that increased life expectancy places substantial pressure on the economic system, as more funds are needed for Medicare rather than for investments in other areas. While this concern is valid to some extent, it is important to recognize that the resources allocated for elderly care come from contributions made by these individuals during their working years. They have invested their efforts into society, and therefore, the younger generation and the government have a responsibility to ensure a robust Medicare system for them.In conclusion, it is evident that the development of the healthcare system enhances people's lives. It paves the way for a sustainable society where individuals can enjoy a fulfilling life in their later years.
142;Successful people do something new or take risks rather than only doing something they know how to do well. AGREE OR DISAGREE.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.Admittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";"The debate surrounding whether successful individuals typically take risks or explore new ventures is nuanced and complex, offering various perspectives. Some believe that achieving success requires stepping outside of one's comfort zone, while others maintain that success often comes from leveraging familiar skills and knowledge. After careful consideration, I align with the latter viewpoint: successful people frequently rely on what they already know.A primary reason for this belief is the inherent desire to minimize risks associated with failure. The fewer obstacles one faces, the greater the likelihood of success. For example, consider an individual who becomes wealthy through extensive investment knowledge. By focusing on companies he knows to be stable, he can earn a steady, if modest, income without exposing himself to high-risk investments that could result in significant losses. Thus, it's reasonable to conclude that successful individuals need not seek out new experiences or take significant risks.Additionally, success often hinges on an individual's ability to navigate barriers that stand in the way of achievement. For instance, elite athletes do not need to resort to performance-enhancing drugs to excel; their success stems from dedicated training and inherent talent. Conversely, athletes who choose to take performance-enhancing substances often face scandal and failure. This reinforces the idea that taking unnecessary risks is not a prerequisite for success.Of course, there are those who argue that embracing the unfamiliar is essential for distinguishing oneself and achieving success. While it's true that innovation can set one apart, I question the validity of this perspective, as it can often lead to imprudent choices. Engaging in new endeavors may bring uniqueness, but it does not guarantee success.In conclusion, I assert that relying on established knowledge and skills can effectively lead to success, as the benefits of minimizing risks and enhancing individual capabilities often outweigh the potential advantages of taking a chance on something new. This does not imply that alternative viewpoints lack merit, but I firmly believe that the rationale I've presented in support of my position is more compelling and convincing."
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;"The purpose of education often sparks heated debate among individuals and society, particularly at the college and university levels. Some believe that all students should have the opportunity to receive education at this stage. However, I contend that such training should be reserved for a select group of highly capable and knowledgeable learners.Firstly, concentrating on talented students is a more effective approach as it allows academic institutions to uphold their standards of high-quality education. Unlike middle and high schools, universities and colleges demand a greater level of skill and ability to navigate a vast array of complex subjects. While some students may excel in high school, the rigors of higher education can be a significant challenge even for the most gifted individuals. This underscores the need for selective admission; allowing everyone access could dilute the educational quality, as institutions would be forced to simplify coursework to accommodate all students.Secondly, universities should prioritize admitting well-qualified students in order to cultivate a skilled workforce for specialized roles. Critics may argue that this creates a ""social division,"" claiming that highly educated individuals might shun so-called ""low-skilled"" jobs. However, this perspective overlooks the reality that standard jobs will always be available to the broader population, while more complex roles should be tackled by the most competent individuals, who emerge from top-tier institutions. By limiting university admissions, we not only incentivize students to strive for excellence but also maintain rigorous academic standards, ultimately enhancing the quality of education and ensuring that the most capable individuals meet the critical needs of society.In conclusion, I believe that while everyone should receive mandatory education up to high school, higher education should be the domain of the most talented students. This approach will enhance the quality of both universities and their graduates, placing individuals in roles that best match their strengths and abilities."
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";"The debate about whether universities should prioritize improving facilities over hiring renowned teachers is a complex issue with various perspectives. Some argue that investing in upgraded facilities is essential, while others contend that attracting famous educators is more beneficial for students. After careful consideration, I align myself with those who advocate for facility enhancements.The primary reason for my stance is the undeniable fact that advanced facilities can significantly enhance the learning experience. For instance, a well-equipped library provides an ideal environment for students to study and conduct research. With a quiet atmosphere and ample resources, students can focus on their studies, ultimately improving their academic performance. It’s clear that quality facilities play a crucial role in supporting students’ educational journeys.Furthermore, students engage in a wide range of activities beyond the classroom, making adequate facilities even more important. Take, for example, a student participating in a jazz ensemble: a superior auditorium is essential for creating memorable performances. Such experiences can leave a lasting impact, enriching the student's education. This illustrates that students would prefer schools to invest in facility upgrades rather than solely focusing on hiring high-profile teachers.On the other hand, some might argue that hiring prestigious educators is vital because they can effectively teach and inspire students. However, I find this perspective flawed; a student’s success is not solely dependent on the teacher but rather on their own dedication and effort. Employing a renowned teacher will not yield results if the student lacks motivation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that investing in improved facilities is more beneficial for schools. The advantages of updated facilities outweigh those of hiring high-profile teachers. While other viewpoints have their merits, I am convinced that the arguments supporting facility enhancements are more compelling and valid."
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;Some argue that high schools should let students choose their own subjects, believing this approach enhances motivation. However, I contend that students should engage with a broad array of disciplines, ranging from literature to mathematics. This foundational education is essential for preparing students for specialized study at university. Additionally, there should be an element of guidance to ensure students face and overcome challenges instead of sidestepping them.To start, it is vital for students to explore various fields of study to discover their true interests. Making decisions about future majors without experiencing a diverse selection of subjects could result in missed opportunities for meaningful engagement with potentially intriguing areas. For instance, a student aspiring to be a mathematician might find a profound interest in philosophy that could lead to success in that field.Furthermore, acquiring knowledge across multiple academic disciplines is crucial. A well-rounded education significantly informs specialized studies. While science has become increasingly specialized, addressing complex problems often requires an interdisciplinary approach that draws on knowledge from fields such as chemistry and physics. Additionally, even when textbooks appear to focus on specific subjects, they usually presuppose a foundational understanding of other areas. For example, comprehending a chemistry text may necessitate some knowledge of physics. Therefore, high school students should have a broad learning experience to effectively prepare for their future university studies.Lastly, students often exhibit a tendency to avoid challenges. They might opt for easier courses, prioritizing enjoyment over rigorous study, which could limit their future opportunities. Consequently, schools have a responsibility to guide students toward making informed choices and to protect their long-term interests.In conclusion, students should explore various subjects and acquire a well-rounded education in preparation for higher learning. Moreover, high schools must take responsibility for shaping students' futures through a thoughtfully designed curriculum.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;As individuals mature, debates about the significance of gaming come to the forefront. Some advocate for adults to engage in games just as children do. However, I believe that games lose much of their importance for adults for several reasons.Firstly, games become less essential when individuals embark on their careers. Some may argue that games provide a necessary outlet for relaxation and balance in adult life. Yet, the demands of work and family often compel adults to forgo lifelong hobbies. Consequently, they struggle to dedicate the time and energy to their favorite games as they once did years ago. For instance, in my country, aside from a small group of professional athletes, most individuals tend to stop engaging in games seriously once they secure stable employment. They frequently perceive such activities as more burdensome than enjoyable in their daily lives.Another notable point is that adults typically do not approach games as a competitive endeavor, unlike children who are often eager to compete and win. For young individuals, the drive to succeed fosters essential qualities, regardless of their involvement in sports events. For example, my younger sister is passionate about fencing, and her competitive spirit enables her to persevere through challenges, even when faced with injury. In contrast, adults often dismiss such attitudes as immature and abandon them. As a result, competitive individuals may struggle to collaborate with friends and colleagues, leading to a gradual disinterest in games altogether.In conclusion, while I believe that adults do benefit from playing games, their approach differs from that of children, often leaning towards a more relaxed and enjoyable experience rather than a competitive one. With the increasing demands of family and work, games become mere leisure activities for adults rather than the essential experiences they are for children.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";Opinions on global culture vary widely. Some argue that a universal culture cannot emerge from the diverse nations around the world. However, I believe that modern technology is fostering the development of a singular contemporary culture for several reasons.Firstly, many countries share a similar education system centered around technology. For instance, teachers assign research topics that students must explore online, compile their findings using computers, and often create presentations with tools like PowerPoint. For example, students in Iran and Canada both utilize Microsoft software for their assignments, illustrating this shared educational approach.Secondly, advances in technology have led to the emergence of similar job markets worldwide. The demand for computer technology professionals is increasing across various nations, prompting students to pursue studies in this area. For instance, many immigrants in Canada with degrees in computer-related fields can easily enroll in Canadian universities and secure well-paying jobs. This trend demonstrates that technology-related careers are sought after globally.Some may argue that certain cultural aspects, like culinary traditions, remain unique to each society and are unaffected by technology. While this argument has some validity, it overlooks the fact that countries like Canada, the USA, and the UK feature diverse restaurants offering dishes from numerous cultures. Moreover, chefs can readily access a wealth of new recipes online. For example, just recently, I dined at a Canadian restaurant where I enjoyed noodles and sushi—traditional Chinese dishes—as well as Greek salad.In conclusion, modern technology significantly influences world cultures, revealing numerous similarities among them. Its impact is evident in education, employment, and culinary practices globally.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;Numerous factors contribute to an individual's success, but the most significant one remains a topic of discussion. Many argue that family support is crucial for success in today’s world, as having a supportive family can facilitate the journey toward achievement. I concur with this viewpoint, believing that family plays a vital role in helping individuals strive for success for several reasons.Firstly, an increasing number of people now have access to higher education. Parents today typically receive a better education than previous generations, enabling them to offer valuable advice and assistance in their children’s careers. In contrast, past generations had fewer educational opportunities. For example, my grandparents never completed high school, so when my father faced challenges in his youth, he often had to seek assistance from his teachers. Today, the landscape has changed considerably. I grew up with more resources than my father did, and whenever I encounter difficulties, I can turn to my parents for guidance. Their broader knowledge allows them to provide effective solutions.Additionally, family members can assist in various areas of life. For instance, when I was uncertain about which major to select for my university studies, my father shared his insights about different fields based on his experiences. Their wealth of knowledge and life experiences enables parents to steer their children in the right direction. Moreover, parents strive to share as much guidance as possible, motivated by a desire to see their children progress.In conclusion, the support from parents and other family members can significantly impact our lives. I firmly believe that with our family's assistance, achieving success becomes a much more attainable endeavor.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";"There are a variety of perspectives on the subject of hobbies. While some individuals prefer watching television, I believe that reading fiction offers a more enjoyable experience than watching movies for several reasons.To begin with, fiction books provide greater attention to detail. When we read, we become deeply familiar with the characters, settings, and timelines of a story. Novels often delve into not only the lives of the main characters but also the supporting figures and the contexts in which the events unfold. For instance, after reading ""Animal Farm,"" which reflects the Russian Revolution, I gained insights into the leaders and various segments of Russian society. In contrast, films typically offer only a brief overview of their plots and characters.Additionally, reading novels is more convenient. Many novels consist of around 100 pages, which may take more than an hour to finish. Yet readers can pick up their books anytime they have a spare moment, such as during a bus or train ride. For example, I've been reading a novel for the past week. With my busy schedule, I can't dedicate an entire day to reading, so I usually read during my commute home from English class. Conversely, watching a complete movie is challenging for me; I can only sit in front of the TV for about 15 minutes before needing to study.Some may argue that watching TV provides valuable learning opportunities, such as acquiring a new language through films. While this notion has some merit, movies can be overwhelming for beginners since the dialogue often progresses too quickly and unclearly. For those starting out, it's generally more beneficial to read novels, which are clearer and more engaging.In conclusion, reading fiction is more enjoyable due to its depth, convenience, and effectiveness for language learners."
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";"Today, English has become a widely used language around the globe, and its prevalence continues to grow. As a result, many local languages are facing extinction. Some argue that this shift is beneficial, as it facilitates communication among people, while others express concern about the loss of these languages. In my view, the adoption of a single global language is a positive development, making the world a more harmonious place.A world with fewer languages fosters better interaction among individuals. With the rise of globalization, many people travel for work, and speaking a common language can alleviate the challenges travelers face in everyday tasks, such as ordering food at a restaurant or navigating unfamiliar places. Moreover, students who relocate for educational opportunities experience less stress, as they can easily make friends and participate in discussions—a significant advantage in a multilingual environment. This creates a smoother transition into new surroundings. Additionally, a common language minimizes misunderstandings and enhances the exchange of knowledge across various fields such as electronics, medicine, and astronomy.Conversely, some individuals are concerned about the decline of local languages, which are integral to the origins and initial forms of communication within diverse cultures. These languages embody local traditions, and as their use diminishes, cultural identities may also shift. Furthermore, local languages are closely tied to history; losing them would render much ancient literature and historical texts indecipherable.In conclusion, I believe that change is unavoidable, and the increasing use of a single language worldwide is a positive trend. Embracing this evolution is essential for creating a better global environment. A common language enhances productivity and unites people, fostering a shared understanding."
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;Change is an inherent aspect of our world, often influenced by human actions that alter the environments we inhabit. This constant evolution can sometimes have negative effects, leading some older individuals to believe that their previous experiences were more favorable than those of today's youth. However, I firmly disagree with this perspective, especially when considering advancements in technology and medicine.We currently inhabit an age marked by rapid technological progress, making our lives significantly more convenient. A prime example of this is the invention of smartphones. The advanced navigation systems incorporated into these devices have saved numerous lives, particularly for those stranded in isolated locations such as forests or deserts. While critics argue that social networks have diminished genuine relationships by reducing face-to-face interactions, I contend that platforms like Facebook actually strengthen connections among friends and family who are geographically separated, something that was nearly impossible less than two decades ago.Medical science has also seen remarkable advancements in recent years, contributing to a healthier and, consequently, a happier society. Thanks to the tireless efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists, individuals with severe spinal injuries can now regain the ability to walk. Additionally, progress in drug delivery systems has led to groundbreaking methods that direct medications to damaged organs, representing a significant medical breakthrough. The increase in the average human lifespan from 50 to around 75 years over the past several decades serves as compelling evidence of the success achieved in the field of medicine.In conclusion, while members of the older generation may assert that life was better back then due to stronger familial and social bonds, I believe this view is misguided and rooted in personal bias. Considering the points highlighted above, it is clear that contemporary living standards are significantly higher, and individuals today enjoy better social and physical conditions.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;There is no doubt that money has become a crucial element in various aspects of our lives today. The topic of teaching financial management to young students is often debated. Some argue that teaching money management skills to teenagers will help them appreciate the significance of money, while others caution that exposing children to financial concepts at a young age may have negative consequences. Personally, I believe that high school students should be educated about money management.One key reason I advocate for teaching financial management to teenagers is that, as secondary school students approach graduation, many begin living independently, such as staying in hostels or with friends, away from their families. Providing money management education at an early age fosters a heightened sense of responsibility and confidence. For instance, when I was younger, my father kept a monthly expense log, and he encouraged me to do the same with my pocket money. This practice ingrained in me the importance of tracking expenses, which has proven invaluable as I navigated my financial journey.Moreover, teaching financial management at an early stage helps students develop a better understanding of their family’s financial situation. It minimizes the chances of them pursuing unrealistic desires. For example, a student from a wealthy background may see no issue in purchasing a gaming console, while a student from a middle-class family may recognize that it is not a necessary expense. Thus, exposure to money management during high school enables students to prioritize their financial commitments more effectively.In conclusion, I believe that teaching students about money management will yield more positive outcomes than negative effects. Nonetheless, this education should be delivered in a constructive manner, ensuring that students do not feel pressured or judged for their spending habits.
153;Some single people like to live with a roommate, while others prefer to live alone. Which would you prefer? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.Apart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.Finally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.In conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.;Many single individuals face a tough choice between living alone or sharing a space with a roommate. Each option comes with its unique considerations. Some prefer the solitude of living alone for the sake of privacy, while others opt for roommates due to practical benefits. Personally, I favor having a roommate because it helps me save money, encourages social interactions, and provides assistance when needed.One of the biggest advantages of living with a roommate is the cost savings. By sharing the rent and utility bills, living expenses become much more manageable. For example, last year I co-rented an off-campus room with a friend, and we divided the rent and heating costs evenly. As a result, I saved around fifty dollars on heating and two hundred on rent each month. Collaborating on expenses significantly eased my financial burden.Beyond financial savings, living with a roommate enhances my social life. It's naturally easier to connect with others when you’re surrounded by people. Sharing a living space opens up opportunities for socializing, such as inviting friends over. One memorable evening, my roommate Millan brought some friends over. Even though we were strangers at first, we quickly bonded over our shared love for video games. We spent the night playing 'Halo' together, and by the end, we had formed a strong friendship. Living with a roommate has undoubtedly made socializing more accessible for me.Additionally, having a roommate means you have someone to turn to for help. More often than not, your roommate may possess skills or knowledge that can assist you in various situations. For example, when my computer unexpectedly broke down, I reached out to the manufacturer for support but didn’t receive any useful advice. Fortunately, one of my roommates noticed my struggle and stepped in to help. He was tech-savvy and quickly resolved my computer issue.In conclusion, while many might choose to live alone for their own reasons, I strongly prefer the benefits of living with a roommate. The perks of reduced expenses, increased socialization, and readily available assistance make a compelling case for shared living. I believe that single people can significantly enrich their lives by choosing to live with a roommate.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;Smoking has always been detrimental to the human body. Numerous studies have demonstrated that cigarettes contain harmful substances that can negatively impact health. Although some smokers argue that smoking helps them work more efficiently or think more creatively, these claims do not substantiate any genuine benefits of smoking. In my view, smoking should be banned, particularly in public spaces like restaurants, as it compromises the comfort of non-smokers.Firstly, restaurants are establishments where individuals pay to savor their meals. Smoking in these environments can undoubtedly disrupt the dining experience for others, making it difficult for patrons to enjoy their food while surrounded by smoke.Secondly, restaurants often serve as gathering places for families. This means that children, grandparents, and pregnant women can be present. Allowing smoking in restaurants sets a poor example for children, who are naturally curious and likely to mimic adult behavior. Additionally, the health of elderly patrons, especially those with heart and lung conditions, can be compromised by secondhand smoke. Pregnant women face the greatest risks, as exposure to contaminated air can adversely affect fetal development.Lastly, passive smokers face significant health risks. Being near active smokers exposes them to dangerous smoke, which can lead to serious illnesses such as strokes, heart disease, hearing loss, and various forms of cancer. It is particularly unjust for non-smokers who do not smoke yet face similar health threats.In conclusion, smoking should be prohibited in restaurants to protect the well-being of all patrons. Laws against smoking in public spaces must be enforced, allowing restaurant management to implement clear policies, ensuring that everyone has the right to enjoy their meals in a smoke-free environment.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;It is evident that violent behavior has increased in films over the past 20 years, often used as a marketing tool. From my perspective, this rise in on-screen violence has detrimental effects on young people, particularly regarding their behavior, emotions, and academic performance.First and foremost, children's behavior is a significant concern for parents, who strive to guide their children's development. Today, children are heavily influenced by television programming. When a beloved child actor portrays violent roles, young viewers may mimic that behavior in an attempt to emulate their favorite star. Consequently, exposure to violence in media can negatively impact a child's behavior.Moreover, young people are particularly sensitive to emotional stimuli. For instance, death is an inherently upsetting topic and depictions of murder are even more distressing. When such scenes appear on screen, they can adversely affect viewers, potentially leading to emotional issues in children.Lastly, it is crucial to monitor the academic engagement of young individuals. For example, if a child watches a frightening film, they may struggle to focus on their studies, especially if they are preoccupied with thoughts of the movie. This distraction can severely hinder their ability to concentrate and perform well academically.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the increase in violence portrayed in films has significantly negative effects on young people, affecting their behavior, emotions, and academic pursuits. Therefore, I think it is essential for parents and filmmakers to take responsibility in managing this issue.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";"In today’s world, information holds significant importance. It has transformed into a commodity that can be sold, purchased, or even stolen. Many assert that ""information is power,"" which underscores the necessity of being well-informed. I believe this assertion is valid for several reasons.Firstly, utilizing a variety of information sources can help ensure the accuracy of the information. Some individuals may deliberately provide misleading information, making it unwise to draw conclusions prematurely. For instance, Russian media reported that the conflict between Ossetia and Georgia was instigated by Georgia, while European outlets claimed Russia was the aggressor. Although clarity emerged later, many people had already condemned Russia's actions based on initial reports.Secondly, it is crucial to distinguish factual information from mere opinions regarding events or issues, as this distinction can aid in forming your own conclusions. Finding reliable facts can be challenging, particularly online, so it is essential to consult multiple sources before arriving at any conclusions. Relying on someone's subjective viewpoint can lead to incorrect decisions. A notable example is when the price of salt in Moscow doubled within a week due to rumors that it would soon be unavailable in stores. This rumor-driven panic drastically affected prices until officials issued clarifying statements to dispel the uncertainty.In conclusion, it is vital to verify the information you use, especially when your conclusions or decisions carry significant consequences."
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;The preservation of historical buildings poses a significant challenge for governments, as they must balance the need for housing with the desire to protect cultural heritage. In my view, all buildings that contribute to our cultural identity should be preserved. There are several compelling reasons against restoring old buildings. The rapid urbanization caused by rural populations migrating to cities in search of job opportunities has intensified the urgency for housing solutions. Consequently, governments often prioritize constructing new accommodations over maintaining older structures. Moreover, the costs associated with preserving these buildings can be quite high due to the historical significance of their components.Historical buildings play a crucial role in our collective past. Tourists frequently choose to explore a country’s culture through its ancient architecture, meaning that cities can benefit financially from the tourism these sites attract. The revenue generated can then be reinvested into their preservation. Additionally, maintaining old structures serves as a means of safeguarding our cultural heritage, providing valuable learning experiences for everyone. Old buildings can also function as cultural museums while offering more suitable housing options for residents. Many cities aim for development strategies that blend unique historical charm with modern amenities, and preserving these buildings is a key part of achieving that goal.In conclusion, both perspectives present strong arguments: the need for housing and the costs of restoration stand in contrast to our desire to uphold cultural heritage and encourage tourism. Nevertheless, I believe we should commit to restoring these buildings, as they represent the most distinctive features of the areas in which they reside.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;In today's world, many young individuals view their mobile phones as the most essential aspect of their lives, as these devices help them stay organized and easily connect with family and friends. However, despite these advantages, I believe that the widespread use of mobile phones among the younger generation is detrimental.Firstly, numerous young phone users face challenges in their academic pursuits due to constant distractions from their devices. The games and applications they engage with consume significant amounts of their time, leaving them with insufficient opportunity for studying and participating in other educational activities. Moreover, internet-enabled phones divert young people's attention towards social media and messaging platforms, rather than focusing on their schoolwork. During my college years, I experienced a similar situation when I became addicted to a mobile game. I invested countless hours trying to achieve higher scores to impress my peers, which ultimately resulted in a lack of interest in completing my assignments and led to me failing a subject that semester.Additionally, young people who own mobile phones often exhibit materialistic tendencies. They are not only motivated by the functionality of a phone but also by its brand, leading to the purchase of expensive models that may not fit a student's budget. This trend is concerning, as many of these young individuals rely on their parents for financial support. It is increasingly common to see teenagers with phones that cost significantly more than their parents' monthly salaries.Overall, the negative consequences of mobile phone usage can adversely affect both a young person's education and character development. For these reasons, I strongly advise young individuals to avoid excessive reliance on mobile phones.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";The primary purpose of punishment is to deter crime within a nation and instill fear in potential offenders. Some argue that the reasons behind committing a crime are irrelevant, advocating for fixed punishments for specific offenses. However, I believe that the circumstances and factors leading an individual to commit a crime should be taken into account.Firstly, implementing fixed punishments for each type of crime may actually lead to an increase in crime rates. Professional criminals would be aware of the consequences and may not feel deterred by the prospect of punishment. Secondly, laws exist for the protection of society, and it's crucial to consider the context of each crime. For instance, a woman who steals food to feed her child should not be treated the same as a woman who steals to support a drug addiction. First-time offenders and repeat criminals should not be imprisoned in the same environment.On the other hand, fixed punishments could streamline the judicial process and potentially be more cost-effective for the government. However, it is essential to ensure that everyone is treated fairly. Often, those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may lack the resources to hire competent legal representation, leading to unjust imprisonment and, upon release, a higher likelihood of becoming repeat offenders. Establishing fixed punishments could widen the gap between the wealthy and the poor, failing to acknowledge the value of every individual.In conclusion, the government should determine punishments on a case-by-case basis. This approach could help reduce crime in society and underscores the shared responsibility of all individuals to uphold truth and respect the laws of our constitution.
160;Some people prefer to spend their free time outdoors. Other people prefer to spend their leisure time indoors. Would you prefer to be outside or would you prefer to be inside for your leisure activities? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your choice.;People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. Moreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.Admittedly, indoor activities are fun. There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity. Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time.;People often find relaxation through various leisure activities. While some individuals prefer to spend their free time indoors, I personally enjoy being outdoors. I believe that outdoor activities are beneficial for my health and help me stay fit. Additionally, these activities allow me to socialize and appreciate the beauty of nature.There are numerous advantages to spending leisure time outside. For instance, engaging in outdoor sports like soccer and baseball is excellent for physical health. Last summer, I dedicated my time to playing these sports. Playing baseball strengthened my upper body for hitting and throwing, while soccer improved my lower body for kicking and built my endurance for playing full 90-minute matches. I truly feel that participating in these activities has had a significant positive impact on my fitness, leaving me feeling revitalized. By the end of the summer, I noticed increased strength and better endurance.Outdoor activities not only enhance my physical health but also provide opportunities for social interaction. When I was ten, I was quite shy. My mother enrolled me in a National Camp, where I initially spent my time eating and playing alone. However, on the third day, a friendly girl approached me while I was swimming, and we quickly became friends. She taught me how to swim effectively, and the next day, we played together, and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and various outdoor activities like skiing and mountain climbing, I've made many friends since that camp. Had I not participated in that experience, I would not have formed such strong friendships today.Moreover, engaging in outdoor activities offers the chance to enjoy the beauty of nature through hiking, sunbathing, or biking. When you spend time indoors, you miss out on the splendor of the natural world. Being outside allows you to breathe fresh air, feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, and enjoy the tranquility that only nature can provide.Of course, indoor activities can also be enjoyable. Reading a book, watching TV, or listening to music can bring happiness. While I appreciate these indoor pursuits, they don't compare to the allure of outdoor activities. Ultimately, everyone has their own preferences when it comes to leisure, and for me, outdoor activities are the ideal way to spend my free time.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;In recent years, numerous airlines have been increasing the availability of affordable flights for their customers. This trend has sparked a range of opinions on cheap air travel. While there are compelling arguments advocating for this phenomenon, I believe that low-cost flights can lead to significant issues.It is indisputable that reduced airfares have expanded travel opportunities for many individuals, especially those from lower-income brackets. Today, millions are able to travel globally for both work and leisure. This accessibility allows them to enhance their careers, broaden their horizons, and engage with diverse cultures. Additionally, increased travel can contribute to the growth of the tourism sector, bolstering economies and job markets in various countries.Conversely, the proliferation of budget flights can have detrimental effects on the environment. The rise in air travel often results in larger, more congested airports, which can increase air pollution for nearby residents and workers. The most pressing concern, however, is the impact on global warming. The combustion of aviation fuel releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to the planet's rising temperatures. While significant efforts are underway to lower CO2 emissions from vehicles and factories, the airline industry has largely escaped scrutiny.In conclusion, I contend that the disadvantages of affordable airfares outweigh their advantages. However, this does not imply that air travel should become more expensive. Rather, individuals should recognize their responsibility to mitigate the emissions resulting from their travel choices.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;There are clear benefits to living in both a large city and a small town. City life provides excitement and convenience, while small towns often offer cleaner, quieter, and more welcoming environments. Nevertheless, despite the many advantages of small-town living, I personally prefer the vibrant atmosphere of a big city for several reasons.Firstly, I have always aspired to work for a large company situated in a bustling urban area. To enhance convenience, I would definitely opt to live close to my workplace, which would also help me save significantly on transportation costs.Secondly, city life is far from monotonous compared to small-town living. Urban areas provide a wealth of modern amenities and facilities. For example, one can explore museums to delve into history, enjoy a well-equipped library for reading, or visit a sports center for exercising. In contrast, smaller towns may lack the development necessary to meet these diverse needs.Moreover, residing in a big city offers greater exposure to various stimuli, including a wealth of information. If one can effectively leverage this information, it can lead to numerous opportunities for achieving personal goals. Advertisements abound in urban areas—whether through flyers or on large screens in commercial districts—providing insights for job seekers, travelers, or consumers looking for reliable products.Additionally, living in a metropolitan area presents a significant advantage when it comes to education for our children. Schools in cities often benefit from greater funding from local communities and government, allowing them to be better equipped with advanced resources and to attract high-caliber teachers. As a result, our children will have improved access to quality education, which is crucial for their future success.In summary, if I seek a more convenient lifestyle with better access to modern facilities and exposure to numerous opportunities, while also ensuring that my children receive an excellent education, I believe that a big city is the ideal place to call home.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;It is undeniable that salary increases and promotions are common methods of rewarding employees for their hard work. However, in my opinion, investing in professional training can also be a highly effective way to motivate employees to continue performing well. Here are my reasons for this perspective.First, training sessions provide employees with a refreshing break from the usual office environment. Working in a corporate setting often involves navigating stressful situations, such as dealing with challenging customers or handling complaints from superiors. During training, employees have the opportunity to make new connections, share jokes, and engage with new information, allowing them to relieve stress and enjoy themselves.Second, when employees receive training, they feel valued by their organization. This investment in their development signals that the company is committed to their growth and success. As a result, employees are more likely to consider a long-term career with the organization. Moreover, they may take pride in being among the fortunate few who receive such opportunities.Lastly, professional training enhances employees' job satisfaction by improving their business acumen. Increased knowledge boosts their confidence in their roles, leading them to achieve exceptional results in their work. Naturally, achieving these high standards will also contribute to their overall happiness, as well as that of their supervisors.In conclusion, offering professional training as a reward for good performance has numerous benefits. It not only helps employees refresh their minds but also increases their job satisfaction and focus.

164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;Attending university classes is a key activity for students, yet it is not the sole path to acquiring knowledge. Students can also gain insights from various other sources, such as personal experiences, libraries, and interactions with peers. For these reasons, I believe that class attendance should be optional.Firstly, university students often find that they can learn more effectively outside the traditional classroom setting. Individuals may prefer self-study in the library, concentrating on specific topics that challenge them. For instance, I have a close friend from my department who grasped class material quickly and rarely attended lectures. Instead, she dedicated her time to mastering concepts that puzzled her. As a result, she graduated with impressive grades.Secondly, students who have a firm understanding of class material shouldn’t be obligated to attend lectures, allowing them to utilize that time for other productive endeavors. Personally, I often skipped biology classes at my university because attendance was not mandatory, and I had already thoroughly studied the subject prior to enrolling. This approach enabled me to focus on my Chemistry research during those periods, ultimately earning A+ grades in both subjects.In conclusion, students should be empowered to determine how to best manage their learning activities and time. They also need to understand the potential consequences of missing classes. Therefore, I believe that class attendance should no longer be a requirement for university students.
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;In a few years, I will complete my university studies and face the decision of whether to settle in a small town or a big city. With my desire to secure a good job and experience new places, I believe I would prefer urban life.Living in a large city presents numerous opportunities. For starters, securing a position in electrical engineering will likely be easier in an urban environment. This field focuses on issues related to electricity supply, and a major city can offer a greater variety of job openings compared to a small town.Weekends in a metropolis are filled with activities. There are countless bars, cafes, and restaurants where I can spend time with friends. Multicultural cities boast a variety of dining options, and as a fan of Italian cuisine, I would certainly seek out an Italian restaurant if one is available.Nightclubs also present an exciting option for young people. They provide a space to enjoy music, make new friends, or relax with a drink alone. The cultural scene in a city is vibrant and diverse. I have a passion for museums, and it would be a delight for me to spend several hours each week admiring renowned paintings, sculptures, and artifacts. On special occasions, cities often host free exhibitions that are accessible to anyone with an interest in art.Moreover, urban areas typically have superior medical facilities compared to rural regions. This assurance of quality healthcare is important, as it means I would have access to reliable assistance should I need it.In conclusion, although small towns offer beautiful landscapes and clean air, big cities provide an abundance of opportunities and entertainment options. Taking all these advantages into account, I would choose to live in a large city.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;"The emergence of computers is a significant outcome of advanced technological development. While some argue that computers have introduced complexity and stress into our lives, others contend that they have made life easier and more convenient. From my perspective, computers have indeed enhanced our lives by facilitating easier access to information and improving the quality of communication.To begin with, computers have revolutionized our ability to access information through the internet. They allow us to quickly gather relevant data, store it on hard drives for as long as needed, and retrieve it when necessary. Search engines like Google and Yandex provide a multitude of features tailored to specific information needs, enabling us to find what we’re looking for within minutes. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter have transformed traditional sources of news, reducing the information monopoly once held by governments. As a result, computers allow us to spend less time searching for information and give us access to diverse sources.Moreover, in our interconnected world, computers have expedited, enhanced, and made communication more affordable. With email, we can send messages to anyone, anywhere in the world, within mere minutes. This convenience eliminates the need to visit a post office; instead, we can simply click a button from the comfort of our own homes to connect with friends and family across the globe. Internet platforms like MSN and Skype have made visual communication a reality, enabling people not only to keep in touch with loved ones but also to conduct job interviews and university admissions remotely. Consequently, communication has become cheaper, faster, and more visual.In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have simplified and enriched our lives by broadening information sources, enabling quick access, and significantly improving communication across various platforms."
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;Some individuals believe that working from home offers employees too much convenience, but I don't share that view. Often, optimal conditions fall short of people's expectations. For instance, working without pressure and social interaction can introduce significant drawbacks.Pressure serves as a motivator. Each workplace has its own set of guidelines that help ensure employees perform their tasks efficiently. Managers oversee their teams and set project deadlines, pushing workers to do their best to meet these timelines. However, when working from home, employees may lack the same drive to complete tasks promptly.While technology enables us to bring work home via computers and modems, it also introduces numerous distractions. Websites like Facebook or Yahoo serve as entertainment but can hinder focus and productivity. In an office environment, established dos and don'ts help minimize such distractions. Conversely, working alone at home can lead to lethargy and decreased engagement, ultimately impacting project completion. Thus, ideal conditions may not be as beneficial as they seem.In-person interaction is a significant advantage of office work. Collaborating on projects fosters improved efficiency, as working with others typically accelerates reaching goals. Additionally, communication skills are enhanced through these interactions, helping employees build friendships and professional relationships. Overall, social interaction contributes positively to work quality.In summary, working from home comes with its disadvantages. The lack of pressure, interaction, and accountability are factors that should be carefully considered by anyone contemplating remote work.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;In today's academic environment, many professors balance their roles as educators with research at colleges and universities. While research can lead to financial support and advancements in their fields, it can also consume significant amounts of time that could otherwise be spent on teaching. In my view, professors should prioritize preparing courses over conducting research.First and foremost, professors play a crucial role in helping students gain knowledge. Their primary responsibility is to mentor students and deliver high-quality courses. Time spent on research can detract from the time available for course preparation, potentially leading to a decline in the quality of instruction. Students enroll in universities to learn about cutting-edge developments, so it is essential for professors to offer well-prepared courses that convey the most current knowledge. Thus, greater focus on teaching is necessary.Additionally, if professors prioritize research at the expense of adequate course preparation, it could damage the reputation of their institutions. Unsatisfactory courses will lead to student dissatisfaction and may result in decreased enrollment. Poorly prepared courses discourage students from choosing certain universities, which in turn makes it difficult for professors to find research assistants. This situation can ultimately have negative repercussions for the entire academic community. Therefore, nurturing talented students should take precedence over research pursuits.That said, research can still serve as a valuable teaching tool. Many students find engagement in research projects to be rewarding and beneficial. For example, students in electronics often create innovative designs such as robots, MP3 players, and remote-controlled cars, gaining practical experience alongside theoretical knowledge. Nevertheless, this experiential learning through research can only be effective if students have a solid grasp of fundamental concepts, which relies on professors providing high-quality instruction. In other words, professors must prioritize course preparation.In conclusion, while research can be advantageous for both professors and students, it must follow the critical foundation of a strong theoretical education for students. A robust academic environment can only be fostered by focusing on student growth. Professors should strive to find a balance between research and effective course preparation, enabling them to succeed in both areas.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;Over the last few decades, the technology sector has achieved numerous remarkable milestones that have significantly benefitted society and individuals, despite also introducing certain drawbacks.On one hand, technological advancements have fueled economic growth and improved living standards. Innovative products and tools developed by scientists and engineers play a crucial role in economic activities. The rise of the internet and advancements in air transportation have enabled businesspeople to engage in extensive international trade and financial transactions, facilitating efficient exports and boosting revenues for many countries.Moreover, cutting-edge technology has enhanced healthcare and quality of life. Medical advancements have notably increased life expectancy in many nations and improved the management of serious diseases. Additionally, advancements in digital entertainment, such as interactive video games and 3D movies, have enriched leisure experiences, allowing people to derive greater enjoyment from technology.On the flip side, technological progress can also lead to negative consequences for both the environment and society. The use of construction technology to expand urban areas and the application of drilling technology by fuel companies to extract fossil fuels can severely threaten ecosystems. Furthermore, advancements in vehicle technology have increased private car ownership, contributing to air pollution in major cities due to vehicle emissions.In summary, while technological advancements do present specific challenges, they offer far more benefits overall.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's society, the idea of a welfare state necessitates that governments ensure accessible healthcare and health education for their citizens. I strongly believe that governments should allocate a larger share of their health budgets to health education and preventive measures.One compelling reason for prioritizing education and prevention in health funding is the potential for enhancing the healthcare system. I argue that reducing the patient load in healthcare facilities can lead to more efficient management of hospitals and clinics, ultimately resulting in improved care for those who are already receiving treatment. Consequently, society must be educated about health issues, enabling individuals to take proactive measures against potential illnesses rather than solely relying on treatment for an increasing number of patients.Another valid reason for governments to invest more in illness prevention and health education is the overall well-being of society. I believe that health is the most essential aspect of human life, with happiness and well-being closely linked to it. Thus, it is crucial for governments to provide resources that empower citizens to adopt strategies for preventing potential illnesses that can bring distress into their lives. For instance, the Ministry of Health in Turkey launched a successful campaign addressing youth smoking, resulting in improved well-being for those who quit smoking and embraced healthier lifestyles after the initiative.In summary, a larger portion of the health budget should be directed towards education and prevention rather than treatment, as this shift would contribute to a more effective healthcare system and enhance overall societal well-being.
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;Many students choose to reside in university dormitories, while others opt for apartments in the city. Each choice has its pros and cons. After reflecting on aspects such as freedom, study conditions, and financial considerations, I would personally prefer to live in an apartment within the community rather than in university dorms.Firstly, an apartment offers significantly more freedom compared to a dormitory. In a dorm, residents must adhere to established rules, whereas in an apartment, you can create your own guidelines. You have the liberty to entertain guests whenever you like or enjoy solitude if that's what you prefer. Additionally, an apartment usually offers greater privacy, allowing you to have your own room instead of sharing space with another student. This is a crucial factor as it provides you with more personal space than a dormitory would.Secondly, though some argue that apartments are pricier, this isn’t entirely accurate. You can offset costs by renting out extra rooms to others, making the rent more manageable. Transportation costs also come into play since you'll need to travel to and from the university daily. You may opt for public transport, which is more economical, or drive a car, which is pricier but offers greater flexibility in terms of schedule and destination.Finally, the study conditions in an apartment tend to be more conducive to concentration. Dormitories can be noisy and distracting, with many students lamenting about loud music or roommates hosting friends at inconvenient times. A private apartment eliminates the issue of a roommate, allowing for a focused environment where you can play music, invite friends, or study late without disturbances. However, living in a dormitory does have its benefits, such as the availability of peer support for academic challenges.In conclusion, while both living arrangements have their merits, I believe the advantages of residing in an apartment far outweigh those of living in a dormitory.
172;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.When people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. Finally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.;Have you ever come across a bear or a monkey in real life? Chances are, it was at a zoo. Zoos are expansive outdoor environments where various species of animals are housed, allowing the public to observe, learn about, and appreciate them. While many people argue that zoos serve no real purpose, I firmly believe otherwise. In my view, zoos foster social interaction, education, and instill virtues like respect and understanding for animals.When visiting a zoo, people typically go in groups—whether with family or as part of a school excursion. This setting encourages interaction, letting visitors relax while observing the animals, engaging in playful commentary about their appearance and behavior, and enjoying the entertaining antics of various species. In today's fast-paced world, families often find it challenging to spend quality time together as they once did. A trip to the zoo offers a fantastic opportunity for families to bond, providing an enjoyable outing for everyone, from young children to grandparents.The study of animals, their habitats, and behaviors is a vital aspect of education at schools and universities. While literature and lectures offer valuable insights, nothing compares to the experiential learning that comes from firsthand observation. At the zoo, visitors can witness animals in action, learning about their dietary habits, social behaviors, and distinct characteristics. They have the chance to see different variations within a species, such as males and females, or babies and adults. Zoos present an exceptional opportunity to observe how animals respond to various stimuli, including weather changes, species interaction, defensive behaviors, and parental care. This experience enhances students’ understanding of their classroom lessons.Ultimately, a visit to the zoo can significantly enhance one's respect and appreciation for animals. Witnessing these creatures in person and gaining knowledge about them fosters a deeper appreciation, particularly for urban dwellers who primarily interact with domesticated pets like cats and dogs. Currently, there is a concerning level of disrespect towards animals. Observing wildlife up close and learning about their significance can heighten awareness of their needs and the respect they deserve.Critics often oppose zoos, citing inadequate care and subpar living conditions for some animals. While this is a valid concern, it does not diminish the fundamental value that zoos offer. Ideally, all zoos would provide optimal conditions for their inhabitants, but even in less-than-perfect environments, the educational and social benefits of zoos remain substantial.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"I have a preference for serious films that are simple, moving, and impactful. Here are my reasons for this choice.Firstly, serious movies often offer a diverse range of themes. In contrast to entertaining films, which primarily aim to amuse, serious films tend to be more substantial and thought-provoking. They commonly explore profound ideas about love and humanity, and they often highlight the darker aspects of society.Secondly, not all serious films are dull. For instance, ""Click"" is an engaging comedy that presents a serious message about balancing family life with professional obligations. This film combines humor and satire to prompt viewers to reflect on what truly matters in life, emphasizing the significance of family. The deeper meanings embedded in serious movies often extend beyond mere dialogue and visuals, encouraging us to contemplate our own lives.Additionally, some serious films challenge audiences to confront the darker realities of the world. ""Blood Diamond,"" based on true events in South Africa, exposes the connection between diamonds and conflict. Watching this film illustrates the harsh lesson that diamonds are not merely symbols of rarity or love; rather, they are linked to a cruel reality. Thus, serious movies can provide a new perspective on the world around us.For these reasons, I prefer serious films that inspire deep reflection on our lived experiences."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;Undoubtedly, the media plays a critical role in conveying important events that affect the public. It is vital that this coverage remains accurate and is not based on gossip. However, the landscape of journalism is changing, with some reporters prioritizing sensational gossip over news related to pressing public issues, leading to an overemphasis on celebrities’ personal lives.Firstly, gossip often presents misleading portrayals aimed at increasing newspaper sales or generating public interest. Such reports frequently include numerous photos that create a narrative, but this can unfairly invade the privacy of the individuals involved and lead to frustration for those being reported on.Additionally, sensationalism diverts viewers' attention away from real social and public issues. Media executives often grapple with the need to choose content that will captivate audiences, resulting in personal reports that highlight trivial information and distorted stories, rather than addressing important societal problems. In essence, yellow journalism distracts the public from significant news concerning education, the environment, and other critical issues.Given these points, I firmly believe that the excessive focus on the personal lives of celebrities poses a significant problem.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;As someone who loves to travel, visiting an outstanding museum is often the highlight of any exploration of a new destination, and this can be attributed to several key reasons.First and foremost, museums provide an easy way to learn about the history of a new location. For instance, when I visited Ellis Island and the Immigration Museum last year, I discovered its significance as a symbol of American immigration and the experiences of immigrants in New York. The exhibits revealed that the Statue of Liberty represents freedom, while Ellis Island served as a gateway where immigrants brought their dreams and fears. This illustrates how museums can enhance our understanding of a place's history and customs.Secondly, exploring a renowned museum can significantly broaden our perspective. The remarkable and diverse array of objects, from classic to magnificent works of art, is truly inspiring! In my city, the National Palace Museum is famous for its collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. I was particularly amazed by the Jadeite Cabbage, an exquisite piece carved from jade that vividly depicts its subject.Furthermore, a local museum is often an ideal destination for tourists. Many travelers embark on adventures without a concrete plan, which may lead them to waste time shopping or lounging at their hotels. By choosing to visit a museum, they can make the most of their limited time and avoid indecision. Most importantly, a local museum embodies the unique culture of the area, allowing visitors to quickly familiarize themselves with their surroundings.For all these reasons, if given the opportunity to explore some of the world’s top museums, we should make an effort to do so. Visiting a museum in a new location is undoubtedly a valuable and enriching experience during our travels.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";"I believe that technology cannot fully substitute for teachers and classrooms. Here are my reasons.Studying from home using technology certainly has its conveniences. One of the main benefits is the 24/7 availability of your course and instructor. Additionally, you can create your own schedule to meet the course requirements, allowing for flexible study hours. However, without strong dedication and effective time management, completing a course from home can be quite challenging.First and foremost, pursuing an educational course at home demands a great deal of persistence and patience. When there's no instructor present to guide you, it's entirely your responsibility to ensure you grasp and fulfill all course requirements. Students may have questions or struggle with specific topics, and finding solutions can be difficult without immediate assistance.Second, studying from home differs significantly from traditional classroom learning. Unlike conventional classes where you engage with teachers and peers in person, distance education lacks this dynamic environment. Many students may find it tough to focus in a home setting, especially those who are easily distracted; such individuals might not thrive in an online learning scenario.Moreover, traditional schooling offers the crucial benefit of socialization, fostering relationships with classmates. While online programs provide valuable knowledge, they cannot teach interpersonal skills or cooperation in the same way that working in teams does during in-person classes. Studying alone at home might rob us of these essential opportunities for interaction and growth.For these reasons, I contend that distance education is not a suitable replacement for traditional schooling."
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;I believe that establishing a large shopping center in our community is a great idea for several reasons.Firstly, a large shopping center would offer residents a more convenient shopping experience. For instance, the Queens Center Mall in the Queens borough of New York City features a diverse range of stores, products, and services—from clothing to electronics and dining options. It is often recognized as one of the most successful malls in New York. During my visit, I discovered that I could find virtually every brand, including Macy's and JCPenney. In my opinion, such a mall would give residents an excellent place to visit in their free time.Additionally, a new shopping center would create job opportunities for local residents. With the opening of new stores, numerous job vacancies would likely arise, providing chances for those seeking part-time or full-time employment. This could be particularly beneficial for students and retirees looking to fill their free time while earning some income.Finally, a shopping center might lead to lower prices and save us time. The competition between the new shopping center and existing stores would encourage businesses to attract customers through promotions. This would make it easier for consumers to compare prices on similar products before making purchases. Plus, residents would benefit from having a shopping center nearby, minimizing their commuting time.For these reasons, I fully support the construction of a large shopping center in our neighborhood, as it would greatly enhance our community.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";"Many individuals perceive life as a constant struggle, which entails facing various challenges throughout our journey. As a result, mastering the art of stress management—finding ways to cope with overwhelming stress—emerges as an essential skill for everyone. Here are my reasons for this belief.Stress, which is our body's response to various demands, can arise from both positive and negative experiences. While stress can serve as a motivating force driving us toward success, it is often experienced unexpectedly, hindering our goals. Without effective stress management techniques, we may suffer from significant consequences.In today’s fast-paced world, it's common for people of all ages, from the young to the elderly, to experience stress-induced depression due to issues like financial strain, exam pressures, relationship challenges, and work overload. Some view stress as a source of strength that helps them overcome obstacles and push towards their best performance; others may struggle to manage their thoughts, emotions, and problem-solving approaches. Hence, the importance of stress management has garnered increased attention in recent times.Moreover, stress negatively impacts our health. Modern life is often rife with hassles, frustrations, and demands, leading many individuals to feel perpetually overwhelmed. This can manifest in physical ailments like insomnia and headaches. The more serious issue of depression can even drive some to consider suicide. Therefore, it is crucial that we learn to mitigate and manage our stress to achieve a balance between our mind and body. To foster a more optimistic outlook, we can share our concerns with friends or family, engage in regular exercise, and try to reframe our challenges in a more positive light.For these reasons, I firmly believe that learning effective stress management techniques is vital for everyone as they navigate their own paths to overcoming stress."
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";Firstly, as social beings, humans naturally coexist within diverse groups that are integral to the process of socialization, from childhood to adulthood. We start engaging with groups and organizations early in our lives, and many of us continue this social involvement throughout our lives. For instance, children learn essential interpersonal skills through teamwork in school settings. As university students, they often join organizations related to their major to enhance their experiences and connect with peers. After graduation, professionals may participate in business associations to access resources and benefits. Therefore, most of us exist within a network of groups.Engaging in an organization offers a constructive avenue for individuals to gain experiences aligned with specific objectives. A well-structured group provides an environment conducive to personal growth and expanding one’s perspectives. For example, as a student specializing in mass media, I participated in a mass media student group for a year. During this time, I not only learned how to work on projects but also had the opportunity to meet notable artists in the field. Most importantly, this involvement has enhanced my resume, improving my chances of securing a desirable job.Moreover, groups and organizations can motivate individuals to take action and accomplish their goals. For example, various charities around the world exemplify this concept. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhist organization in Taiwan, is renowned for its contributions to community service and healthcare. Their generous spirit inspires hope and mobilizes volunteers and sponsors to undertake significant tasks. As a result, they illuminate the lives of the poor and marginalized, while also enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds to assist those in need globally.In light of these reasons and examples, it is evident that groups and organizations play a crucial role in various aspects of our lives, transcending age and background.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;I am excited to learn that the government plans to establish a new university in my community. This initiative presents several benefits, such as increasing educational opportunities for local residents and creating jobs. However, it may also lead to some social challenges.The new university will provide many members of our community the opportunity to pursue their education without having to travel long distances. For instance, someone living in a remote area with no nearby universities may be reluctant to leave their family to attend school elsewhere. Now, with a university in our community, they can enroll in a local business program without the hassle of traveling across the country.Additionally, the university will need to hire faculty and staff, leading to numerous job openings. This influx of available positions will stimulate job growth within the community as well. When people gain employment, they are more likely to spend money on goods and services, which can further boost the local economy.On the downside, the construction of the university might also give rise to some social issues. Many individuals from other areas may relocate in search of educational opportunities or jobs at the university. An increased population can lead to challenges such as heightened traffic congestion, greater waste management needs, and potentially rising crime rates. These factors could negatively impact the quality of life for existing residents.In conclusion, I support the plan to build the university, as I believe the benefits will outweigh the drawbacks. However, it is essential for the government to conduct a survey to gauge the community's opinion regarding the new university before moving forward with the project.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";"Some individuals argue that the government ought to cover college tuition and expenses for any citizen who wishes to pursue higher education. However, I contend that individuals should bear the responsibility of paying for their own college tuition due to the high costs involved, the personal nature of the decision to attend college, and the availability of alternative funding options.To begin with, making college education free for all would impose significant financial burdens. It would redirect public funds away from essential services such as law enforcement and infrastructure. There are several pressing needs that should take precedence, such as providing healthcare for all Americans and enhancing public schools. Furthermore, this initiative would likely lead to repeated tax increases to support college education funding, affecting all taxpayers regardless of whether they benefit from it.Secondly, attending college is a personal decision. Not everyone aspires to higher education; it is those who seek to enhance their earning potential and improve their quality of life who opt for a college degree. Therefore, it is appropriate for these individuals to invest in their own educational choices rather than relying on government support.Lastly, there are numerous avenues available for financing a college education. Those unable to afford tuition can access scholarships, financial aid, and various funding sources. Moreover, the government already contributes indirectly to college expenses, providing essential services such as fire and police protection, medical assistance, and funding for academic research. While such funds are not distributed directly to students, these contributions are still significant.In conclusion, individuals should take responsibility for financing their own education, as it represents a personal choice. Relying on the government for this funding would impose unnecessary costs on taxpayers and the broader community."
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";Television offers numerous benefits, such as relaxation, staying informed about current events, and expanding our knowledge. However, have you ever considered how television might be undermining communication among friends and family? I believe this to be one of the most damaging impacts of television.Firstly, excessive television consumption can lead to social isolation. For instance, children often become engrossed in movies and music shows, neglecting school and time spent exercising or socializing with friends. As a result, they may gradually drift apart from their peers both academically and socially.Secondly, as families acquire multiple televisions—often having three or four in a single household—communication suffers. Parents and children tend to retreat into their own rooms to watch TV rather than engaging in meaningful conversations. Consequently, children may form their behaviors by absorbing what they see on screen, rather than learning from their parents. This dynamic significantly diminishes interaction within the family.Finally, prolonged television viewing can lead individuals to unconsciously adopt negative behaviors that foster discord. For example, children exposed to films depicting terrorism might begin to view such actions as acceptable. What if they were to mimic the actions of the terrorists depicted in Hollywood movies? Could this be a contributing factor to societal division?In conclusion, while television has its advantages, it has also eroded communication among friends and family. It is imperative that we address this issue promptly, with a primary focus on mitigating the violent behaviors that children are exposed to through television.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life.";Have you ever traveled to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you been in a stadium, cheering, yelling, or even crying alongside thousands of fellow fans? If you have a deep passion for football and your local team, there's nothing quite like being present in the stadium to cheer them on, rather than simply watching from home.Firstly, attending a live football match is an incredibly fulfilling experience. Before the game starts, you can feel the energy outside the stadium, with thousands of fans waving team flags, wearing vibrant outfits, and making music with trumpets and rattles. Once the match begins, the excitement inside the stadium skyrockets. You get to watch football stars play right in front of you and share that thrill with around 40,000 people. The energy is electric, far surpassing the experience of watching from home. When a goal is scored, the collective roar of celebration makes the stadium feel alive. Watching alone just doesn't compare.Secondly, being at a live football game is a unique experience.

It can create unforgettable moments that you'll cherish for years to come.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";While renewable energy resources play a crucial role in both current and future energy strategies, I believe that they are unlikely to replace fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal in the near future.To begin with, the technology surrounding renewable energy remains relatively expensive, making it challenging for developing countries to invest in. The costs associated with research and development in this field can be prohibitively high. In contrast, fossil fuels are often abundant and more affordable in various regions. For instance, China has the largest coal reserves globally, and the government is hesitant to allocate significant funds to new energy sources like pricey solar panels and wind farms. Consequently, the shift to renewable energy may encounter obstacles, particularly in nations with limited financial resources.Additionally, despite claims from utility companies that renewable energy is environmentally friendly, these energy sources may not be as clean as they are portrayed. Recent studies have highlighted potential long-term environmental risks associated with them. For example, hydroelectric dams can disrupt river ecosystems, leading to droughts in nearby areas and harming fish and bird habitats. Moreover, the buildup of heavy metals in the sediment behind these dams poses significant cleanup challenges, burdening future generations with ongoing environmental issues. This raises concerns about the reliability of renewable energy solutions.While it's true that fossil fuels contribute to serious environmental issues such as acid rain, ozone depletion, and global warming, many of these challenges can be addressed through improved efficiencies and emission reduction strategies. For instance, using chemicals to desulfurize emissions from power plants and vehicles can mitigate acid rain, and these methods are often more cost-effective and easier to implement than the advanced technologies required for renewable energy. As a result, fossil fuels may appear to be more sustainable in the short term.In summary, despite the optimism surrounding renewable energy, it is unlikely that these new sources will replace fossil fuels anytime soon.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;In today’s society, there is a widespread belief that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry take precedence over the preservation of land for endangered species. Critics of this perspective argue that reducing habitat for these animals could disrupt ecological balance. However, I personally align with the view that human demands for farmland, housing, and industry are paramount. Here are my reasons.First and foremost, land dedicated to agriculture, housing, and industry offers significant benefits to society as a whole. There is no doubt that these sectors—particularly industry, which serves as the backbone of the national economy—drive economic growth and generate substantial profits. Furthermore, an increase in farmland and industrial activity fosters social stability and harmony by creating more job opportunities, ultimately lowering both unemployment and crime rates. Thus, prioritizing farmland, housing, and industry is essential.Additionally, the development of farmland, housing, and industry directly fulfills our basic needs for a better quality of life. These sectors provide the food we eat, the homes we inhabit, and the clothing we wear—all of which are fundamental for survival. This is especially true in impoverished areas where meeting basic survival needs is of utmost importance. Moreover, advancements in agriculture and industry can enhance living conditions and improve overall quality of life.Lastly, I would like to point out that while farmland, housing, and industry may encroach upon habitats for endangered species, such developments can also lead to better conservation efforts. A stronger economy allows us to invest in advanced methods to protect endangered animals. For instance, new technologies can be developed to help these species reproduce, ensuring their survival instead of extinction.In conclusion, while the preservation of endangered species is important, the human need for farmland, housing, and industry is ultimately more critical.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;While there are certain benefits to learning a foreign language in one's home country, I strongly believe that individuals who study a language in the country where it is spoken gain a more profound understanding of various language skills than those who learn it domestically.For instance, a person in country 'A' learning a non-native language might benefit from a structured, step-by-step teaching method. This setting allows them to gradually immerse themselves in the language without the pressures of being in a foreign environment. They can allocate sufficient time and effort to mastering the language, and since other learners are likely from the same background, they probably adhere to a similar learning approach.In contrast, a learner who chooses to study the language in the country where it is spoken has the unique advantage of direct interaction with native speakers. They can forge friendships with locals and engage in groups that include people from the host culture. This experience undoubtedly enhances their grasp of essential language skills. Additionally, they gain access to contemporary expressions, idioms, proverbs, and cultural nuances that the learner in country 'A' may not encounter.Overall, if I were to learn a new language and had the financial means to travel, I would definitely opt for the second approach. Numerous studies indicate that communication is a crucial factor in language acquisition. Immersing oneself in an environment where everyone communicates in the target language and expects the learner to respond in kind compels rapid and effective learning.In summary, while both methods of language learning offer their own advantages and disadvantages, I am convinced that the benefits of studying a language in its country of origin significantly outweigh those of learning it in one's home country.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";While some may argue that students should dedicate their entire day to academic studies, I firmly believe that physical exercise is an essential component of each school day. Exercise is beneficial not just for maintaining physical health but also for enhancing mental well-being. Moreover, incorporating physical activity into children's daily routines is an effective way to instill the value of exercise from a young age.Engaging in physical activity enables children to develop healthier physiques. Given the rising trend of childhood obesity, having regular exercise can be extremely advantageous for children, providing them with necessary breaks from long periods of sitting in class. Furthermore, consistent physical activity can reduce their risk of illnesses associated with cardiovascular problems, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol levels.Regular exercise also plays a critical role in enhancing children's cognitive function. It is well-documented that exercising regularly improves overall bodily function. When individuals engage in physical activity, their respiratory systems work more efficiently, ensuring that all organs, including the brain, receive adequate oxygen. This mental break provided by daily exercise can significantly boost children’s learning effectiveness.Instilling a routine of daily exercise in children from an early age teaches them the vital importance of incorporating physical activity into their lives. Although children often receive lectures on nutrition and exercise, they are likely to benefit more when they can put that knowledge into practice. Establishing such routines early on can transform physical activity into a lifelong habit.Incorporating physical activity into children's school days should be given serious consideration. It will enhance both their mental and physical health while fostering a habit that allows them to appreciate the significance of including this vital activity in their daily lives.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;In my view, it is not advisable for teenagers to hold jobs while they are still students. While some may argue that working provides valuable experience, I believe it can disrupt their lives in several significant ways. For one, having a job can negatively impact a student's health. It distracts them from their studies and takes away from their childhood.In today's competitive world, students must dedicate a significant amount of time to their education to excel academically. If they choose to work in their spare time, it can create an unnecessary burden. Jobs come with various responsibilities, such as attendance and sometimes additional tasks, which can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and fatigue. As a result, students may struggle to find adequate time for relaxation and sleep, negatively affecting their mental and physical well-being.Furthermore, working at a young age can shift a student's focus away from their studies. The allure of earning money may lead them to feel independent, causing them to prioritize work over their education. This shift in priorities can result in decreased interest in their studies and even lead to dropping out to pursue financial opportunities.Additionally, one of the most significant drawbacks of teenagers taking on jobs is that they miss out on the joys of childhood. Committing to work can mean forgoing experiences such as hanging out with friends, participating in clubs, and engaging in recreational activities. While there will always be opportunities for career growth in the future, the childhood years are irreplaceable and should be cherished.Therefore, it is crucial for teenagers to concentrate on their education. Balancing a job with academic responsibilities can harm their health, distract them from their studies, and rob them of a vital stage in their lives.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;Spending free time at zoos has become a popular pastime among children. Zoos, established for centuries around the globe, have evolved into engaging entertainment venues. However, there is ongoing debate about whether zoos are beneficial to people or simply a form of poor treatment for animals.Proponents argue that zoos provide significant advantages for humanity. Firstly, they offer a unique form of entertainment, allowing visitors to experience the wonders of nature and wildlife, which helps alleviate stress and pressure. Additionally, zoos serve educational purposes, enabling students and the public to observe and learn about the animal kingdom firsthand. Furthermore, many zoos play a critical role in conservation, housing endangered species and contributing to their protection.Conversely, critics contend that zoos infringe upon the freedom of animals. They argue that confinement can strip animals of their natural instincts and lead to feelings of distress and unhappiness. For them, zoos resemble prisons, and they view it as cruel and unethical to keep animals in such conditions.In my opinion, I align more with the supporters of zoos. In today’s world, where natural habitats are rapidly being destroyed to accommodate urban development, zoos have become increasingly vital as places for people to learn about and appreciate nature. Moreover, many zookeepers are making tremendous efforts to enhance the well-being of animals, creating artificial habitats that mirror their natural environments and ensuring that their care includes proper nutrition and hygiene.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;When I had the opportunity to study in a group with my classmates, I found myself wishing I could go back in time and retake all my exams. I am a firm believer in the value of group studying, as it offers several distinct advantages: receiving assistance from peers, enhancing my learning attitude, and managing my time more efficiently.When students form study groups, each member gets an equal opportunity to support one another. This collaborative effort allows them to tackle challenging aspects of a subject together. For instance, when a group encounters a difficult math problem, they can pool their insights to find a solution. Furthermore, studying in a group significantly helps students identify and address their weaknesses.Another key benefit of group studying is the boost in motivation and a spirit of competency. In a group setting, the most driven members inspire others to strive harder. Additionally, students often experience a sense of collective responsibility, pushing them to achieve high grades as a unit. Clearly, improved learning is a notable outcome of this encouragement and camaraderie.To maximize their time, students should establish a schedule when studying together. Group study inherently creates a sense of obligation to manage their time effectively, as everyone is mindful of not wasting each other’s time. Consequently, time management emerges as another significant advantage of studying in a group.In conclusion, I greatly prefer studying with my friends because of the valuable opportunities it provides. I can benefit from the support of my peers while enhancing my learning skills, and I also achieve better time management. Now, it's time to move forward without any regrets about my past exams.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;Although friendship is one of the most valuable aspects of life, individual preferences vary: some people enjoy the company of one or two close friends, while others prefer being surrounded by a larger group. Personally, I lean towards the latter.One compelling reason is that maintaining relationships with a diverse array of friends offers the chance to learn from their unique experiences. For example, among a larger circle, there might be individuals who engage in specific sports, play musical instruments, or have a passion for travel. Their stories and insights can inspire you to explore new interests that you may have never considered.While these differences can facilitate learning, they can also lead to challenges in reaching consensus. This is less likely to occur when spending time with just a couple of close friends, where shared interests and preferences are more common.Additionally, having a wide circle of friends can broaden your perspective when faced with a dilemma. If you seek their advice, you’ll receive diverse viewpoints, enabling you to weigh different advantages and disadvantages more effectively.In contrast, having only a few close friends allows you to build deeper, more intimate relationships where trust flourishes. However, their viewpoints may be quite similar to yours, potentially limiting the growth you could experience.In conclusion, while both options—maintaining a few close friendships or a larger social circle—have their benefits and drawbacks, I believe that spending time with a larger group of friends enriches life more significantly.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The advancement of public transportation is crucial for a thriving society. It helps mitigate the depletion of natural resources, reduces air pollution, and fosters a sense of community. Therefore, I believe the government should allocate more funding to enhance public transportation systems.Utilizing public transportation is one of the most effective ways to conserve our dwindling natural resources. Personal vehicles rely on oil and gasoline, which are finite resources. An excessive reliance on private cars can lead to their rapid depletion. In contrast, public transportation options, such as buses, trains, and subways, can transport many more people while consuming significantly less fuel per person.Moreover, public transportation plays a vital role in reducing air pollution. Cars emit harmful gases, including carbon dioxide and other pollutants, contributing to environmental degradation and climate change. As the number of cars on the road increases, so does the level of pollution. By opting for public transportation, we can decrease the number of vehicles on the road and consequently lower emissions, creating a healthier atmosphere for everyone.Additionally, using public transportation encourages social interaction. When we drive alone or with family, we miss opportunities to connect with others and can feel isolated from our communities. Public transportation allows us to meet new people and experience diverse aspects of life, fostering a greater sense of belonging.The benefits of public transportation are significant, especially as modern society grapples with challenges such as environmental degradation, social isolation, and resource depletion. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to invest more in these systems and promote their use among the public.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;"Many individuals argue that zoos serve as valuable resources for animals, while others contend that they are lesser beings and do not warrant our concern. Personally, I believe it is crucial to support animals in living safely and comfortably within their natural habitats.Numerous scientific studies have demonstrated the negative impact zoos have on animals. Firstly, like humans, animals are born with innate instincts that enable them to thrive in their natural environments. When we confine them and impose unfamiliar lifestyles, they begin to lose these instinctual skills. As a result, if they are eventually released or, in unfortunate circumstances, escape, they may struggle to survive, leading to increased mortality rates.Furthermore, many zoos lack the appropriate resources and policies needed to ensure adequate animal care. I recall my first visit to a zoo at the age of eight; I was horrified by the treatment of the animals. I cannot recall a single staff member who acted appropriately toward the animals. Instead, they resorted to physical punishment when the animals refused to eat, justifying it as a form of training.In conclusion, I firmly believe that we must assist animals and ensure they have the highest possible quality of life. Scientific evidence highlights the harm zoos can inflict on them, and many facilities fail to meet the necessary standards of care."
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;"Many universities worldwide aim to advance research in various countries, focusing on fields such as business and agriculture. If a university were to initiate new research in my country, I would prefer the establishment of a center for agricultural research over one for business research.Firstly, my country possesses vast tracts of land that are underutilized in agriculture. Establishing a research center could empower local citizens to optimize these lands for agriculture. Additionally, it would provide support to those facing challenges related to land management, particularly individuals who lack knowledge or education in this area.Secondly, an agricultural research center could significantly enhance my country's economy. Currently, agriculture accounts for only about thirty percent of our market share. By developing agricultural products through research, this center has the potential to increase that share. For instance, dates are a key agricultural product in my country; research could focus on improving the quality of this crop, effective cultivation practices for date palms, and land management techniques.Moreover, establishing an agricultural research center could generate numerous job opportunities. Educating people on how to cultivate land and produce quality agricultural goods may encourage them to pursue careers in agriculture rather than in business or other sectors.While some argue that a business research center is more critical for keeping pace with advanced countries, I believe that true development should not solely concentrate on business. We should prioritize what genuinely contributes to our sense of fulfillment, and for my country, agriculture is that key area.In conclusion, my country would benefit significantly from investing in agricultural research centers, as they would lead to positive outcomes in agricultural practices, economic improvement, and job creation."
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;Throughout our lives, we encounter numerous opportunities for learning and skill development. Individuals adopt various methods to expand their knowledge. Personally, I prefer hands-on learning over passive approaches such as reading or listening to lectures. There are several compelling reasons to advocate for this experiential method for those genuinely committed to learning.Firstly, learning through direct experience fosters personal growth and maturity. When we engage in tasks independently, we cultivate self-reliance and confidence, reducing our dependence on books or external guidance. This process allows us to gain valuable insights and experiences that contribute to our personal development. For instance, someone aspiring to become a leader must practice leadership in real-life situations, such as managing a team. You cannot truly understand leadership by merely reading about it or listening to others discuss it.Moreover, hands-on learning tends to be much more exhilarating than traditional methods of reading or listening. There are countless life skills that can only be mastered through practice. The thrill and satisfaction of doing something can't be replicated through a book or a lecture. Take swimming, for example: to truly grasp the skill, one must get into the water rather than just read about it or hear others explain it.Additionally, learning by doing often provides a greater source of motivation. Over time, reading and passive listening can become monotonous. In contrast, engaging in active learning brings enjoyment and satisfaction, especially when we achieve proficiency in a task. This sense of accomplishment can inspire us to take on new challenges and continue learning through hands-on experiences.History has demonstrated that experiential learning is one of the most effective ways to gain knowledge and skills. Relying solely on reading or passive listening limits our potential. Instead, we should embrace opportunities to try things for ourselves and persist until we achieve our learning goals.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;"In recent years, many airlines have been increasingly offering their customers a growing number of budget flights. Opinions on affordable air travel vary widely. While there are strong arguments in favor of encouraging this trend, I believe that the proliferation of cheap flights can lead to significant issues.There is no doubt that lower airfares have opened up travel opportunities for many people, especially those with lower incomes. Today, millions can journey around the globe for work or leisure, allowing them to advance their careers, expand their knowledge, and connect with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. Additionally, increased travel contributes to the growth of the tourism industry, bolstering the economies and job markets of numerous countries.Conversely, the rise of budget flights has detrimental effects on the environment. More flights often result in larger and busier airports, which can increase air pollution for those living and working nearby. The most pressing concern, however, is the impact on global warming. The combustion of aviation fuel releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to the warming of our planet. While significant efforts are underway to decrease CO2 emissions from automobiles and industrial sources, little has been done to regulate emissions from airlines.In conclusion, I contend that the negative consequences of inexpensive airfares outweigh their advantages. This does not imply that air travel should become more costly; rather, individuals must recognize their responsibility to minimize the emissions stemming from their lifestyle choices."
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;Many individuals believe that governments should allocate funds to enhance roads and highways, while others argue that investing in public transportation is a better option. In my view, it is essential for governments to prioritize spending on public transportation, as it addresses the challenges posed by the increasing number of private vehicles.Firstly, public transportation significantly reduces resource consumption in transportation. Cars rely on gasoline, a non-renewable resource, meaning that a higher number of cars leads to a more rapid depletion of this resource. Conversely, efficient public transit systems consume far less gasoline per person, helping to conserve this precious natural resource.Secondly, public transportation plays a crucial role in mitigating air pollution. On average, public transit vehicles consume significantly less gasoline per passenger compared to private cars. This means that by opting for public transport, we can decrease the amount of gas exhaust released into the atmosphere, alleviating the congestion and fumes that people often endure on the roads.Lastly, utilizing public transportation is considerably safer than driving privately. According to the National Safety Council, taking the bus is over 170 times safer than traveling by car. Therefore, there’s no justification for governments to hesitate in investing in public transportation, which offers a healthier, safer, and more economical means of travel.In conclusion, I firmly believe that funding improvements to public transportation is vital, as it is essential for safeguarding our environment and creating a healthy, safe living space for communities.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;Everyone has their own approach to achieving success in life. In academic settings, whether at school or university, success largely hinges on our study methods. While some students thrive in group study environments, I personally prefer studying alone, as it enhances my concentration and fosters personal growth.Studying independently allows me to better focus on my lessons. For instance, I find it challenging to grasp my subjects unless I'm in a solitary environment. This allows me to create my own schedules, guidelines, and exercises to review comprehensively. Additionally, many subjects, such as math, reading, and drawing, necessitate individual study. I believe I can maximize every moment by studying on my own without distractions.Moreover, studying alone contributes to our personal development. For example, tackling homework by myself reinforces my sense of responsibility and independence. It also encourages attention to detail in my future work. When I set a study plan with specific deadlines and adhere to it, I enhance my ability to be precise and meticulous moving forward.In conclusion, there are various ways to study, and it's important to choose the method that best aligns with our individual personalities, whether that’s alone or in a group. Personally, I advocate for solo studying, as it boosts my focus and aids in building my character. Achieving success requires hard work and dedication, regardless of whether we choose to study independently or collectively.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";"The impact of human activity on the Earth—whether it is improving our living conditions or causing harm—is a topic of ongoing debate. Some argue that human efforts have positive effects on the planet, yet I firmly contend that our actions are detrimental to the environment. Human activities are polluting the atmosphere, depleting natural resources, and endangering the survival of other species.Human beings are significantly harming their ecosystem. In recent decades, as consumption has risen, so too has the amount of waste generated. Both household and industrial waste have increased to the point where a ""new"" continent of rubbish is emerging in our oceans. Moreover, industrial emissions are polluting the air, leading to serious environmental issues such as acid rain, global warming, and climate change.Additionally, humans are exhausting the Earth's natural resources. Resources such as oil and coal are essential for our daily activities, resulting in a dramatic increase in exploitation to meet endless demands. Researchers warn that most natural resources are not recyclable, and within a matter of decades, we may completely deplete these essential materials. This depletion would severely impact human life, given our reliance on these resources.Furthermore, human activities are putting other species at risk. Hunting has been a primary source of food for millennia, but with advancements in weaponry like rifles and dynamite, many animal populations have been decimated, leading to the extinction of several species. As the human population grows, we are encroaching further into the habitats of other animals, shrinking their living spaces and pushing many towards the brink of extinction.In conclusion, the evidence presented supports the notion that human activities are gradually destroying the Earth. We are polluting the environment, depleting vital resources, and putting other species at great risk."
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";"If given the chance to advise a company on where to allocate funds—supporting the arts or aiding environmental initiatives—I would unequivocally opt for the latter for several compelling reasons.First and foremost, the need for conservation is more urgent now than ever before. According to the International Animal Preservation Association, only ten percent of animal species that have ever existed are still with us, putting our planet’s biodiversity at grave risk. Additionally, rising sea levels due to global warming pose serious threats to human life in numerous countries. If we continue to emit carbon dioxide through the use of non-environmentally friendly vehicles, nations like Japan could face submersion, while weather patterns may shift, resulting in increased flooding, droughts, and severe storms. In essence, the state of our ecosystem is at an all-time low, and if we do not take decisive action immediately, we may never have the chance again. Moreover, investing in environmental protection can yield long-term benefits for the company. More consumers today are becoming increasingly aware of conservation issues, making sponsorship of environmental initiatives a powerful marketing strategy. Imagine the positive impact on your company’s reputation if a project you supported successfully enhances the environment; it could establish your brand as environmentally conscious, which is an appealing trait in today’s consumer-driven market.Lastly, a commitment to conservation contributes to a higher quality of life. While I acknowledge that art serves as a vital form of entertainment, pollution and environmental degradation can diminish our ability to appreciate it. A thriving biodiversity and a more beautiful natural landscape not only enhance our environment but also serve as inspiration for artists and their work.In conclusion, although supporting the arts may offer short-term advantages for both individuals and companies, I firmly believe that prioritizing environmental protection will yield more significant long-term benefits."
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;In the workplace, you encounter individuals from various backgrounds, and fostering positive relationships with many of them is essential for a harmonious work environment. However, the relationship you maintain with your immediate co-worker is particularly crucial, as this person works closely with you and is often someone you depend on. In my opinion, a good co-worker embodies three key traits: cooperation, trustworthiness, and camaraderie.First and foremost, co-workers must cooperate with each other. A lack of collaboration can lead to numerous conflicts. I once had a colleague who prioritized family commitments over work, consistently leaving the office on the dot, regardless of whether his tasks were complete. I found myself frequently covering for him to shield him from our strict supervisor. Then one day, when I needed to leave early to take my mother to a doctor’s appointment, I asked for his assistance in finishing our tasks. He declined my request, offering a flimsy excuse. From that point on, I stopped helping him, and as a result of his irresponsibility, he was eventually transferred to another department. This experience reinforced my belief that cooperation among co-workers is vital for a productive work atmosphere.Trust among colleagues is equally important. It’s essential that they do not operate based on suspicion. I once faced a situation where one of my subordinates was distrustful of a co-worker, believing he was spreading rumors about him. While there were instances that fueled his concern—since the co-worker did seem to highlight his flaws—I have a strict policy against gossip and eventually, the rumor-spreading ceased. Yet, the lingering mistrust created a toxic atmosphere for everyone in our department.Lastly, fostering a sense of fellowship among co-workers is beneficial for both work satisfaction and the development of strong personal relationships. Given that we spend a significant portion of our day at work, having supportive colleagues can truly be a blessing. 
202;When people succeed it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success. Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.First, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.Secondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. Thirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. Although it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.;"There are numerous examples of luck bringing unexpected opportunities to people. However, I find it illogical to rely on luck as a means to achieve one’s goals. Therefore, I firmly support the idea that hard work is what ultimately leads to success.Firstly, relying solely on luck for your achievements is a significant gamble. Luck is intangible and cannot be depended upon; there's no assurance that it will come your way. If luck fails you, the outcome can be disheartening. On the other hand, if you put in the effort to reach your goals, your dedication will at least bring you closer to your objectives. Personally, I've found that all my successes have been a result of hard work rather than luck, which has kept me from facing the disappointment of unfulfilled aspirations.Secondly, believing in the power of hard work makes you a visionary. Those who trust in their own efforts are clear about their aspirations and understand their destination. They systematically plan the steps needed to achieve their goals and continuously assess their progress until they reach them. In contrast, those who depend on luck often wander aimlessly. For instance, a friend of mine, facing financial difficulties, constantly bought lottery tickets under the illusion that winning would solve his problems. Unfortunately, luck has yet to favor him, and his situation has worsened.Lastly, hard work can sometimes attract good fortune, propelling you even closer to your goals. My boss exemplifies this; he diligently worked towards a promotion by meticulously addressing all qualifications needed for advancement. Recognizing that obtaining a master's degree would enhance his credentials, he managed to complete his studies despite numerous commitments. As a result, he not only secured the promotion in a competitive environment but also received a nomination for a scholarship abroad due to his impressive credentials.While it certainly helps to be lucky, placing your hopes solely on luck is unwise. Thus, I strongly advocate for hard work, which is far less likely to disappoint than luck can be."
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;In today’s digital age, online classes have become increasingly appealing and widespread. Nearly every educational institution has developed its own online learning system. A question that often crosses my mind is whether online computer classes should replace traditional classroom learning. While online classes offer numerous benefits, I personally prefer traditional learning for several reasons.First and foremost, interactions with classmates and professors are crucial to the learning process. Collaborative group work fosters lively discussions and encourages diverse viewpoints among students. These dialogues not only broaden students' perspectives but also enhance their appreciation for their peers' ideas. In contrast, online learning provides limited opportunities for meaningful exchanges with fellow students.Additionally, classroom learning encompasses a variety of extracurricular activities beyond academics. During free time, students can participate in sports, engage in lab work, or utilize the library—each of which promotes social interaction. Building connections with friends not only enhances cognitive abilities but also allows students to learn about their communities. Conversely, online courses tend to confine students to their homes.Lastly, the support provided by professors in traditional settings is invaluable. They are readily available to assist students with problems or offer guidance. Professors are genuinely invested in their students' success and are always willing to help. In stark contrast, the role of professors in online learning often feels diminished. They may primarily focus on teaching, and responses to student inquiries can take a considerable amount of time.In conclusion, traditional learning continues to offer significant advantages for students. However, it appears that online learning will become increasingly mainstream in educational institutions.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The question we face is whether university students should be required to attend classes. This topic is significant, as it impacts a large number of students globally. However, policies on this matter vary widely. A key consideration is whether the goal is to maximize students' acquired knowledge or the variety of meaningful experiences they have during their education. In my opinion, students should have the freedom to skip classes, as it enhances their quality of life, boosts their motivation to learn, and fosters essential life skills.Firstly, adopting a more flexible attendance policy is practical. Monitoring attendance involves considerable administrative work, which becomes especially challenging in larger classes. Making attendance optional can save both time and resources.Secondly, learning styles differ among students, and some may find they absorb information better at home, perhaps through independent study of textbooks. This is particularly relevant when instructors exhibit a lack of enthusiasm. Allowing students the choice to skip classes gives them the chance to avoid ineffective teaching, enabling them to utilize their study time more efficiently and engage with the course material on their own terms.Moreover, the freedom to decide whether to attend classes enhances flexibility and overall student well-being. For example, a lively party on Thursday night might end at midnight, but a Friday morning lecture could deter students from fully enjoying the night. With a more liberal attendance policy, students can choose to prioritize their social lives and move their learning to the afternoon, fostering a sense of autonomy and improving time management. Research indicates that greater satisfaction in these areas correlates with better academic performance.Lastly, psychology identifies two types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic. The former, which stems from within an individual, is generally more beneficial as it leads to enhanced learning and well-being. To develop intrinsic motivation, students need to understand their strengths and goals. By allowing them the choice to attend or skip classes, students can reflect on their reasons for pursuing their studies, ultimately fostering self-motivation. These skills are invaluable not only throughout their education but also in their future lives.In conclusion, I strongly believe that class attendance should be optional for students. This approach not only enhances their current educational experience but also equips them with vital skills and knowledge that will serve them well beyond their time in university.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;The location where we choose to live has a profound impact on our lives, influenced by various factors. While some individuals thrive in bustling urban environments and high-rise buildings, I personally favor the serenity of small towns. I believe that small towns offer numerous advantages, including pleasant weather, a healthy lifestyle, and improved amenities.Firstly, one of the primary benefits of residing in a small town is the healthier lifestyle it promotes. The combination of favorable weather and lower population density contributes to this advantage. With less congestion and reduced traffic, small towns generally experience lower levels of pollution, both in terms of air quality and noise. This cleaner environment leads to reduced stress levels and increased happiness. Furthermore, the availability of fresh, wholesome food in small towns often surpasses that found in large cities, making it easier to maintain a nutritious diet. In general, it is clear that living in a small town tends to be healthier than life in a sprawling metropolis.Secondly, the cost of living is another significant advantage of small-town life. Living expenses are typically lower in small communities compared to larger cities. This allows residents to enjoy spacious homes with beautiful surroundings, as well as access to more amenities and services due to the reduced density. Additionally, transportation costs are generally lower, and with less traffic, residents can save both time and money.In conclusion, I strongly prefer small-town living due to its many benefits, such as reduced stress stemming from better weather and more meaningful interpersonal connections. In smaller communities, people are more familiar with one another and often foster better relationships, in contrast to the sense of isolation that can prevail in larger cities. Overall, it is evident that residents of small towns experience greater happiness, stronger friendships, and lower levels of illness and stress.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;In recent times, an increasing number of young people from rural areas are relocating to cities in search of employment and educational prospects. I believe this trend has certain drawbacks, which I will explore in this essay along with some reasons behind it.To start, the primary factor driving the migration of young adults to urban areas is the availability of better-paying jobs and educational opportunities compared to the countryside. Major corporations and universities are predominantly located in cities, which are often viewed as ideal places for career advancement. Consequently, many young individuals move to urban centers to pursue their academic goals and find well-paying jobs that promise a higher standard of living. For instance, a graduate who remains in the city after completing their studies and searches for a lucrative job, instead of returning to their village for agricultural work, may soon be able to afford a home or a car.Nonetheless, this trend can lead to several negative consequences. The influx of young adults from rural regions into cities undoubtedly contributes to overpopulation. This surge can result in inadequate living space for the growing number of residents, leading to poor housing conditions and sanitation issues. Moreover, this demographic shift can place significant strain on the environment. A larger population in urban areas typically correlates to an increase in vehicles on the road, subsequently causing air pollution.In summary, while young people are increasingly seeking education and job opportunities in urban environments due to the multitude of options available, I personally do not support this trend. The associated negative impacts, including diminished quality of life and environmental degradation, raise concerns that should not be overlooked.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;In today's society, the economy plays a crucial role in our daily lives. Understanding the fundamentals of economics is essential for students, and the sooner they engage with this topic, the more proficient they will become. Therefore, I believe that high school students should take a basic economics course, even if it requires some investment of time. Let me elaborate on this.Firstly, a basic economics course can provide students with a clear academic direction. It introduces them to the key concepts of the field, helping to spark their interest and guiding their career aspirations. As a result, students may become more motivated to pursue their economic goals.Additionally, economics is closely linked to politics. By studying economics, students can gain insights into political environments and broader national issues, extending their learning beyond just textbooks. Moreover, economics is interconnected with business and enterprises, allowing students to acquire practical, real-world knowledge.Furthermore, a basic economics course can ease students' transition to college. With prior exposure to economic concepts, they may find it easier to grasp advanced material, allowing them to study more efficiently and deeply than their peers. This experience can boost their confidence and adaptability in the classroom.Taking all these factors into account, I strongly advocate for the inclusion of a basic economics course in high school curricula.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;"University serves as a gateway to life, providing us with essential knowledge and virtues that contribute to our success. This raises an important question: should admission to university be reserved for the highest academic performers, or should it also be accessible to ambitious young individuals? Both perspectives warrant discussion before arriving at a conclusion.On one hand, academically exceptional students are well-suited for university due to their intellectual advantages. These students can easily grasp complex concepts, while others may find such information overwhelming. Moreover, it is fair to argue that individuals who have worked diligently deserve the opportunities that university offers, as it is akin to a reward for their efforts.However, university life extends beyond academics; it also fosters artistic talents and soft skills. Thus, access to higher education should be granted to a broader range of young people who seek to explore their passions and develop holistically.Additionally, limiting university access solely to top performers could lead to increased social issues. Those left out might face disillusionment, while many unprepared individuals could struggle with job applications, particularly for white-collar positions.In conclusion, the debate over restricting university access has both advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I believe that the potential negative consequences outweigh the benefits, which is why university should be available to a diverse array of learners."
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today’s society, the idea of a welfare state entails that governments must ensure sustainable healthcare and health education for their citizens. I wholeheartedly believe that a larger share of health budgets should be allocated to health education and preventative measures.Firstly, increasing funding for education and prevention can significantly enhance the healthcare system. By reducing the number of patients relying on treatment, hospitals and healthcare facilities can operate more efficiently, resulting in improved care for those who do require treatment. Thus, it is essential for society to be educated about health issues, enabling individuals to take proactive measures to prevent illnesses rather than merely responding to an ever-growing patient population.Secondly, prioritizing health education and illness prevention directly contributes to the overall welfare of society. In my view, nothing is more vital than health in an individual’s life, as happiness and well-being stem from good health. Therefore, the government’s responsibility is to empower its citizens with the knowledge and resources needed to avert potential health issues that can lead to suffering. A notable example is the Turkish Ministry of Health’s campaign addressing youth smoking, which successfully promoted healthier lifestyles and improved the well-being of those who quit smoking.In conclusion, a larger portion of the health budget should be dedicated to education and prevention rather than treatment. This shift is crucial for creating a more effective healthcare system and enhancing the overall well-being of society.
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;"In recent years, students have increasingly faced stress due to a growing number of academic assignments designed to boost their educational performance. While some advocate for the complete elimination of non-academic subjects, I firmly disagree with this perspective.Firstly, from a health standpoint, it's crucial that schools offer more than just academic courses. The absence of physical education from the curriculum can significantly impact students' well-being. For example, after spending an entire morning in a classroom, engaging in outdoor activities like stretching, jogging, or playing sports can enhance students' learning capabilities for their afternoon classes. Eliminating physical education would not only jeopardize young people's health but also hinder their ability to learn effectively.Moreover, schools have a vital role in cultivating well-rounded individuals. Achieving success in life encompasses much more than academic accomplishments; it requires practical life skills, such as cooking, effective communication, and teamwork. Therefore, the ultimate aim of education should extend beyond academic knowledge to include teaching students how to become independent and lead fulfilling lives.Some may argue that children can acquire practical skills at home after school with parental guidance. However, I contend that this approach is flawed, as many young people prefer to spend their free time watching TV or playing video games rather than learning essential life skills from their parents. Furthermore, parents often lead busy lives, making it challenging for them to impart these skills to their children.In conclusion, I am convinced that non-academic subjects are just as critical as academic ones for a student's overall development. As such, schools should maintain these subjects and not eliminate them from the curriculum."
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When people relocate to a different country, they often encounter a dilemma: whether to adopt the customs of their new environment or to maintain their original traditions. Some individuals opt to embrace the new culture in order to assimilate, while others cling to their customs, finding it challenging to accept the unfamiliar. Personally, I would choose to adopt the customs of the new country if I were to migrate.On one side, embracing new customs can facilitate a smoother integration into the new society. Migrants often experience culture shock due to the stark differences between their homeland and the new environment. Customs are a significant aspect of culture, and engaging with them can enhance understanding and acceptance. For instance, if someone dressed in white to attend a traditional Buddhist sutra reading on Buddha's Birthday in India, they would gain insights into Indian culture and beliefs. This deeper understanding fosters adaptation and helps individuals become more attuned to their new surroundings.Conversely, holding onto one’s original customs can lead to feelings of isolation and discrimination. When individuals assert their own customs and reject the local ones, they may inadvertently create a divide between themselves and the native population. A historical example of this is the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969, who established Chinatowns and maintained their language and traditions. While local Indonesians adhered to a 4:00 PM workday, the Chinese continued working, which generated resentment. Despite their economic success, they faced discrimination, with local resentment manifesting in vandalism and hostility. Had the Chinese immigrants chosen to adopt local customs, they might have reduced their visibility as a distinct group and lessened the potential for discrimination.In conclusion, immigrants would benefit from embracing the customs of their new country, as this can aid in overcoming culture shock and foster a smoother transition into the new culture.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;"In today's increasingly interconnected world, the ability to collaborate is essential. Teamwork is a critical skill that everyone must develop to achieve success. However, I would argue that the ability to work independently is even more crucial.While effective collaboration can streamline processes and enhance efficiency, there will always be situations where teamwork isn't feasible. A clear example of this is standardized testing, where collaboration is prohibited. Imagine excelling in discussions with peers but lacking experience working solo; high-stakes tests like the SAT and TOEFL could become daunting challenges. Since assessments play a significant role in our lives and most do not involve teamwork, it's vital to cultivate self-sufficiency if you aspire to achieve goals like attending college or excelling in final exams.Furthermore, honing your ability to work independently can actually enhance your effectiveness in group settings. Teamwork doesn't eliminate the need for individual contributions; each member must bring their own ideas to the table before engaging in discussion. When collaborating, we must still think independently as our brains operate separately. If each team member is encouraged to express their unique perspectives, the overall effectiveness of the group improves.In summary, both collaboration and independent work are essential skills for a successful life. However, the ability to work alone serves as a foundation for effective teamwork and is instrumental in a variety of situations."
213;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Use examples and specific reasons to support your position.;Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.First of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.Furthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. Lastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. To conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.;Smoking can bring individuals pleasure and relief, but it should not come at the expense of others' health. Therefore, I firmly believe that smoking should be banned in restaurants and other public spaces, and that we should support state laws aimed at prohibiting it. Smoking not only compromises the atmosphere of dining establishments but also poses a serious health risk to those around.First and foremost, while it may be harsh to say that smoking should be entirely banned in all areas of society, smoking in a restaurant often reflects a disregard for the well-being of others. It is widely acknowledged that secondhand smoke poses a greater risk to bystanders than the act of smoking itself. For instance, when one person smokes in a restaurant, everyone else in the vicinity is exposed, unwittingly compromising their health. The harmful substances in cigarettes can severely damage respiratory systems upon inhalation. Therefore, imposing a strict ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of all patrons and maintain a clean dining environment.Moreover, many diners may be unconcerned about the dangers of secondhand smoke, but the unpleasant odor can significantly diminish their dining experience. The smoke exhaled by smokers often creates discomfort or disgust, which can negatively impact their enjoyment of meals. This can lead to a decline in the restaurant's popularity, as fewer customers are willing to dine there due to unpleasant experiences associated with smoking.Lastly, smoking is detrimental not only to the smoker's health—making them more susceptible to respiratory illnesses—but also to their public image and reputation. This is particularly true for public figures such as politicians or celebrities, as smoking in restaurants may be perceived as disrespectful behavior. The public may view such actions as indicative of a lack of basic civility, undermining the smoker's standing as a leader.In conclusion, smoking in restaurants is a harmful and disrespectful act. It damages the smoker's reputation and endangers the health of others. Thus, it is unwise to smoke in restaurants and other public places, and relevant state laws should be enacted to enforce a strict prohibition against it.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";"The question of whether people should engage in hobbies and physical activities has sparked considerable debate, with differing opinions on the matter. While some argue that we should concentrate solely on our jobs, I believe that pursuing hobbies and physical activities offers numerous benefits.Firstly, participating in hobbies and exercising is an excellent way to maintain physical fitness. Spending long hours in front of a computer screen can lead to lethargy and health issues, making it essential to engage in sports or hobbies to avoid becoming overweight or developing vision problems. For instance, my neighbor Tom used to work as a computer engineer in a large company. He relied on fast food and never made time for exercise. After realizing that his weight was hindering his chances of finding a girlfriend, he committed to losing weight. He began jogging each morning, and after a month, he had not only slimmed down but also found a girlfriend.Moreover, engaging in one activity for an extended period can become monotonous; hobbies and sports help refresh our minds. For example, students are given breaks between classes to unwind for a few minutes and prepare for the next session. Humans are not machines; we cannot sustain continuous work for hours on end. Taking a short break to indulge in sports or hobbies can effectively recharge our energy.Finally, each of us should cultivate at least one personal hobby—not for the sake of showing off, but to express our emotions during times of stress or sadness. Playing a musical instrument, for example, can be incredibly therapeutic. I play the classical guitar, and whenever I face challenges in my studies, I pick up my guitar and play ""Green Sleeves."" It helps lift my spirits and boosts my confidence.While it may take time to develop personal hobbies, the rewards are significant: a healthier body, a more refreshed mind, and a powerful outlet for managing stress and sadness. Therefore, I strongly believe that pursuing hobbies and engaging in physical activities outside of work is beneficial for everyone."
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;"The rapid growth of the population has led to increased demands for transportation. Many countries have faced long-standing issues related to pollution, noise, and accidents. In my view, enhancing roads and highways is the most effective solution to these challenges, and I will outline three key reasons for this belief.Firstly, it is widely understood that improving public transport can actually exacerbate pollution and accident rates. Public buses, cars, and trains frequently emit harmful gases that are linked to serious health issues, such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Additionally, the noise generated by engines can negatively impact our hearing. Most importantly, road accidents are a significant concern; for instance, in my country, buses are a major contributor to rising accident statistics. Each year, approximately twelve thousand lives are lost in Vietnam due to traffic accidents, a toll comparable to that of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can expand transport capacity, enabling more efficient public transportation. Not only will buses benefit, but personal vehicles will also navigate more easily. For example, I often find myself leaving school at peak hours when traffic is at its worst, making it difficult to travel home in just one hour. However, if the roads were expanded, everyone could reach their destinations more quickly, significantly reducing the likelihood of collisions.Lastly, allocating funds for the renovation of highways and roads can enhance their overall quality. Many of us dread traveling on poorly maintained roads riddled with potholes, which often lead to accidents and instill anxiety in drivers. We shouldn’t solely blame drivers for these mishaps; authorities also share responsibility for the state of the roads. Furthermore, a smooth road surface contributes to safer and more efficient transportation.In conclusion, the benefits of upgrading roads, as I have outlined, are both compelling and essential. I firmly support this initiative and hope that the government will prioritize investment in road infrastructure as a matter of utmost importance."
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;"Life is filled with challenges, difficulties, and unforeseen obstacles. Therefore, gaining knowledge about life is essential to anticipating problems and having the confidence to overcome them. Two primary methods for learning about life include heeding the advice of family and friends and acquiring knowledge through personal experiences. Both approaches have their unique advantages.On one hand, learning from the insights of family and friends can be more pragmatic. Family members, particularly parents, have a wealth of life experience and can offer honest and valuable guidance across various aspects of life. Friends, who are often of the same generation, can relate to your interests and abilities, helping you discern what is suitable for you. By considering the advice of those close to you, you can avoid many unexpected pitfalls.Conversely, gaining knowledge through personal experience fosters independence and maturity. Experiencing life firsthand can reveal countless opportunities you might otherwise miss. For instance, if a friend cautions you against trying skydiving due to its dangers and you take their advice, you might miss out on the exhilarating sensation of free-falling. Furthermore, relying too heavily on others for guidance can lead to a sense of dependence. Embracing the freedom to make your own choices, regardless of the potential consequences, is a path many successful individuals choose to follow.In my view, while both methods have their merits, I lean towards the latter. Personal growth is a gradual journey, and experiencing life for yourself is invaluable. I believe that through firsthand experiences, one can learn far more than by merely following advice. After all, our parents and other predecessors have navigated their own lives independently; why shouldn’t the younger generation do the same?In conclusion, each method of learning about life offers its own benefits. However, I find learning through personal experience to be the more fitting approach for me."
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;"Throughout life, everyone experiences moments of joy, both in childhood and adulthood. In my view, childhood represents the happiest phase of a person's life.First and foremost, children typically experience more happiness than adults. They aren’t burdened by concerns like bills, jobs, or future uncertainties. Instead, their primary focus is on having fun, learning, and enjoying life. A typical day for a child revolves around school, play, and rest. For instance, when I was younger, I would come home from school, grab my bike or soccer ball, and head outside to play with friends in the neighborhood. Those days were carefree; I didn’t have to think about expenses or responsibilities — just pure fun and discovery. Additionally, children are often the most creative, generating new games and ideas purely for joy and amusement.Moreover, childhood is a time dedicated to education, making school memories some of the most cherished in a person's life. It’s in school where many experience their first crush, forge lasting friendships, and create unforgettable memories filled with laughter. For example, my father frequently shares how some of the best moments in his life occurred during his school years. He still keeps in touch with several classmates, and they often gather to reminisce about their childhood adventures.In conclusion, childhood truly encompasses some of the happiest moments in life. With only one childhood to live, it's essential to embrace and savor every moment of that unique time."
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;Advancements in technology have made food preparation much easier in today’s world. With kitchen appliances like microwaves and toasters, cooking meals has become more convenient than ever. Additionally, instant food products can be prepared in just a few minutes, greatly enhancing the cooking experience and saving time, which positively impacts our daily lives.Firstly, the reduction in cooking time allows people to engage in other activities they enjoy. This transformation has freed many homemakers from the burdensome cooking routine, giving them more opportunities to spend quality time with family or pursue other endeavors. Furthermore, individuals can afford to sleep a little longer before heading to work, as preparing breakfast now takes just a few moments.Secondly, the ease and convenience of food preparation encourage the storage of a wide variety of foods at home. People can enjoy diverse meals, even when dining alone, allowing them to choose their favorite dishes. Moreover, more men are becoming willing to take part in cooking, a role they may not have embraced previously. This shift can have positive effects on family dynamics.In conclusion, the simplified and time-saving food preparation process grants us the freedom to partake in other activities, increases our access to a variety of foods, and fosters greater willingness to cook. While there may be additional viewpoints I haven't fully explored, I firmly believe that these changes have significantly enhanced our quality of life.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;Learning to be independent is crucial for young adults, but determining the right time for them to leave home can be challenging. In my opinion, remaining with parents for an extended period offers more advantages than disadvantages for young adults. My perspective is founded on the value of creating memories, financial savings, and the benefit of parental guidance.First and foremost, one of the key benefits of staying with parents is the opportunity to share experiences. Young adults should strive to create lasting memories with their parents during this formative time. Once they enter the workforce, they may find that job opportunities are limited in their hometowns. By living with their parents longer, they have greater chances to bond, engage in activities, and travel together. These shared moments become invaluable treasures as time goes by, making the time spent at home well worthwhile.Additionally, residing at home is more cost-effective than living independently. Achieving independence often means needing to rent an apartment, which can become a financial burden for both the young adult and the parents. Moreover, the day-to-day expenses of living alone can add up significantly. By staying with their parents longer, young adults can help the family save money while also giving themselves time to prepare for future financial responsibilities.Lastly, young adults benefit greatly from their parents' guidance. In times of uncertainty, parents can offer comfort and support, providing the kind of advice that comes from deep familiarity and love. Without their parents' immediate assistance, young adults might face unnecessary challenges. By valuing this guidance, they can navigate obstacles more effectively.In conclusion, staying with parents for an extended period fosters shared memories, reduces expenses, and provides essential parental advice. Therefore, I believe that young adults are better off living with their parents for longer.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;"Some may argue that zoos are unnecessary in our globalized world, where knowledge can be acquired quickly and easily. However, I strongly disagree. Zoos hold immense value for humanity; they are vital for education, play a key role in wildlife conservation, and serve as fascinating travel destinations.Firstly, zoos provide individuals with new knowledge. Imagine being a child and not having access to a zoo—how would you learn about different animal species? Zoos are essential for gaining foundational knowledge. They also offer students the opportunity to learn biology in a hands-on way, allowing them to observe animal behaviors and characteristics up close. This practical experience can be much more engaging than traditional classroom lectures. Additionally, researchers rely on zoos to study diverse animal species and gain insights for their scientific work.Secondly, zoos play a crucial role in preserving numerous endangered species and ensuring they have safe habitats. Compared to the wild, zoos provide a less dangerous environment for animals, where zookeepers supply food and care. Moreover, techniques like artificial insemination are utilized to help sustain populations of nearly extinct wildlife.Lastly, the unique, fascinating, and diverse animals found in zoos can attract a significant number of tourists. Many people are eager to admire these creatures up close, and a zoo that draws both domestic and international visitors can generate substantial revenue. This influx of tourism can positively impact the local economy, benefiting the country as a whole.In conclusion, zoos not only play a critical role in protecting endangered species but also enhance the lives of people worldwide. I firmly believe that zoos are incredibly valuable to our planet."
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;It is clear that parents are a child’s first teachers, guiding them in how to walk, speak, and develop into good individuals. Furthermore, they equip their children with essential social skills and knowledge to prepare them for the future.Firstly, parents impart fundamental lessons that shape their children’s lives. As infants, babies are unaware of the world around them, but they absorb everything from their parents. Parents make an effort to explain concepts in a gentle and simple manner, allowing their little ones to grasp and learn from these interactions. As a result, parents open up a vibrant and fascinating world to their children’s minds.Secondly, parents play a crucial role in teaching their children to be good individuals. They instill basic manners, such as expressing gratitude and offering apologies appropriately. While they explain the difference between good and bad behavior, they also model positive interactions with others. Although it may seem straightforward, this guidance greatly impacts their children's future interactions and fosters better behavior as they navigate the real world.Thirdly, it is undeniable that parents are the ones who love their children most and provide constant care. They offer invaluable knowledge and advice drawn from their own experiences. Unlike professionals, parents provide unwavering support, helping their children develop strong social skills that enable effective communication and the cultivation of healthy life habits. Indeed, parental support is a key factor in a child's future success.In conclusion, parents are truly the best teachers, imparting knowledge and wisdom driven by love. They consistently strive to create an environment conducive to their children’s growth, preparing them for the challenges of life ahead.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;In today's world, we have experienced numerous technological innovations, including television. While many people argue that TV has detrimental effects on children due to its potential for violence and inappropriate content, I firmly believe that the benefits of television far outweigh the negatives. I have two key reasons to support my viewpoint.Firstly, television offers a wealth of informative and educational programs. Alongside current news broadcasts, there are numerous shows designed to educate viewers. When utilized wisely, these programs can significantly enhance children's knowledge. For instance, in South Korea, we have a program called EBS, which is aimed at children and teenagers. It provides lectures on various subjects, allowing students to learn effectively. Additionally, many documentary films showcase the lives of notable figures in Korea, which can inspire viewers. Engaging with such educational content can foster inspiration and learning, rather than contributing to negative experiences.Moreover, television can serve as a valuable tool for stress relief. Many programs, including sports shows, provide an enjoyable escape for children who may be feeling overwhelmed by academic pressures. For example, I often felt stressed about schoolwork, leading to frustration. However, after watching a thrilling soccer match between Korea and Japan, I found that my stress dissipated. This experience rejuvenated my motivation to continue my studies with renewed energy.In conclusion, while it's true that some television programs may contain violence, I believe that if children approach TV thoughtfully, they can experience far more positive outcomes than negative ones. With its array of educational content and its ability to relieve stress, television can be a beneficial resource for children. For these reasons, I strongly oppose the notion that television negatively impacts young viewers.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;Many entrepreneurs believe that it is safer to hire employees for life in order to maintain productivity and efficiency. However, I contend that this perspective is not only conservative but also outdated. I am inclined to argue that businesses should avoid long-term employment contracts for three key reasons.Firstly, diverse ideas and creativity from different individuals are essential for a company's success. While veteran employees offer invaluable experience to new hires, fresh talent often brings innovative and original ideas. The rapid advancements across various fields today necessitate constant updates and access to new knowledge, which younger workers can provide. They often possess enthusiasm, creativity, and a proactive approach, all of which are critical for achieving exceptional performance. These factors can significantly influence a company's potential for growth.Secondly, employees often become bored with their roles when they are held in the same position for too long. Initially, many may view job security as paramount to sustaining their livelihoods. However, most come to realize that opportunities for advancement and competition can greatly enhance their skills and broaden their perspectives. Many individuals thrive on challenges and wish to avoid the monotony of a stagnant work environment, as boredom can lead to dissatisfaction and, ultimately, adversely affect the organization.Lastly, economic downturns and financial crises often lead to a significant rise in unemployment. I believe that businesses should strive to hire more personnel to address this pressing issue. By doing so, they not only provide opportunities for the unemployed to improve their circumstances and support themselves but also ensure that companies benefit from a diverse range of talents, bolstering creativity and productivity.In conclusion, the varied talents of individuals, the risk of job monotony, and the need to address unemployment all support my belief that employers should not commit to hiring staff for their entire careers. I am confident that forward-thinking leaders recognize the importance of offering opportunities to a diverse workforce.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";"I wholeheartedly believe that childhood is the happiest phase of life. This happiness stems not only from a lack of responsibilities and daily struggles but also from the joy of learning new things every day and the freedom to express our thoughts and creativity.As we transition into adulthood, we become burdened with various responsibilities that dictate our daily routines. We are told when to wake up, how to dress, and how to act. Every action is scrutinized and judged by those around us. In contrast, while childhood does come with some responsibilities, we enjoy a greater sense of freedom to engage in what we like. The consequences of being late for school or laughing inappropriately are far less severe than they would be in adulthood.Another remarkable aspect of childhood is the ability to learn fascinating new things about the world every day. As children, we are explorers in a vast universe filled with wonders waiting to be uncovered. New facts, captivating stories, and sights abound, making childhood a time of constant surprise.The freedom to use our imagination and express ourselves without fear of judgment is another significant advantage of being a child. Children are less likely to be criticized for their thoughts, allowing their imaginations to flourish. In adulthood, we often find ourselves constrained by societal norms, which stifles our creative expression and ability to think freely.In many ways, childhood represents the happiest time in our lives. This happiness is not merely a reflection of the carefree nature of childhood but also highlights the constraining realities that come with adulthood. Ideally, a world with fewer restrictions, less social judgment, and greater freedom of thought would foster more joy; however, since this is not our reality, many of us long for the simplicity and wonder of our childhood days."
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";"Many believe that ""the past has no bearing on the present, as time is constantly moving forward, and each generation differs significantly from the one before."" While it is true that life evolves quickly, there are invaluable lessons to be learned from history, including insights into mistakes, successes, and knowledge across various fields.Firstly, the errors made by those who came before us are essential considerations in our quest for understanding the past. Since life is too short to learn solely through personal experience, we should study the mistakes of others to avoid repeating them. Each mistake, regardless of its size, serves as a valuable lesson. If we can leverage these lessons, we will be better equipped to handle the complexities of life, ultimately saving ourselves from numerous failures and wasted effort.Secondly, the successes of previous generations are just as important as their mistakes. While the missteps of our predecessors guide us indirectly toward our goals, their accomplishments provide us with a more direct path. By examining how others have achieved their objectives, we can adopt and apply their methods, increasing our chances for success. For example, Thomas Edison's quote, ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration,"" remains relevant today and likely will continue to inspire future generations.Lastly, the past serves as a foundation for the development of new knowledge and inventions. Without the discoveries and insights of those who came before us, our modern advancements would be unimaginable. How could America have emerged as a global leader if Columbus had not stumbled upon it while seeking a route to India? How would contemporary scientists explore the concept of gravity without the legendary story of the apple falling on Isaac Newton’s head? These are just a few examples of the invaluable knowledge that history offers us, which we must not overlook.In conclusion, the mistakes, successes, and knowledge of the past profoundly influence our lives today. Instead of dismissing history, we should embrace it to pave the way for a brighter and more promising future."
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;"Space exploration, aimed at uncovering the mysteries of the universe, became a reality for humanity in the 20th century. The United States and Russia are among the key nations that allocate substantial budgets for research in this domain. In my view, investing in space exploration is crucial for safeguarding the future of humanity.While some governments argue that funding space exploration is a waste of resources, I believe the primary challenge facing humanity is the need to find new habitats for life. During the 20th century, despite significant advancements in technology, such as the development of rockets, we have yet to discover a viable new home on another planet. Throughout history, Earth has been threatened by various celestial bodies, presenting a considerable danger to human existence. Therefore, it is imperative to seek out new potential living environments beyond our planet.During the Cold War, space exploration also served as a tool for military power. In the future, many countries will likely focus on developing new missile technologies to deter attacks from adversaries. The historic space race between the United States and the Soviet Union exemplifies this, as both nations competed to send humans to the moon and demonstrate their superiority. Consequently, space exploration has increasingly been intertwined with military ambitions.In conclusion, allocating funds for space exploration should not be seen as a waste of resources; rather, it has the potential to preserve the future of human civilization. Although exploring space is intended for the discovery of new planets, many governments now also utilize rocket technology for military ends, indicating a shift in the objectives of space exploration."
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";"Television stands out as one of the most significant innovations we engage with on a daily basis. While there are certainly drawbacks to watching TV, it also offers many advantages. Some critics argue that television has harmed communication among friends and families, but I contend that it has actually fostered connections. TV shows often become popular topics of conversation and serve as excellent opportunities for social gatherings.

228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;"There is an ongoing debate about whether allowing a friend to make a mistake is preferable to taking action that may jeopardize the friendship. Many people believe that mistakes can lead to significant negative consequences. However, I hold the view that friendship is more valuable than a friend’s mistakes, even if those mistakes can be severe. In this essay, I will provide two reasons to support my perspective.Firstly, mistakes are typically temporary, while friendships can last a lifetime. Most people don’t dwell on past mistakes; if someone does, it often reflects a narrow mindset. In reality, mistakes are often quickly forgotten. For instance, my friend Lee once accidentally broke a cherished gift of mine. Despite my initial frustration, I moved on within a couple of days and felt at peace with him again. Some may call me foolish for this, but I believe that mistakes are generally more forgivable than the bonds of friendship.Secondly, everyone makes mistakes. If you choose to end a friendship every time a mistake occurs, you may find yourself alone. While it is understandable to end a friendship over a major error, for minor mistakes, it is important to show understanding and forgiveness, as friends are invaluable in our lives. Research has shown that 85% of people consider friendship to be one of life’s greatest gifts.In conclusion, I believe that a mistake should not jeopardize a friendship, especially if it is minor, because true friendship endures and is one of life’s greatest treasures."
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;In today’s world, society has become more competitive than ever, and parents have a crucial role in teaching their children how to become self-sufficient and independent, much like how animals instruct their young on survival skills. There are various methods parents can employ to facilitate this learning, such as assigning household chores or encouraging their children to clean their own rooms. Personally, I believe that encouraging teenagers to take part-time jobs is one of the most effective ways to prepare them for adult life for several reasons.First, when children earn their own money rather than relying on an allowance from their parents, they gain valuable experience in managing finances. For example, when I was 16, I found a summer job and earned my own income. However, when it came time to purchase textbooks at the start of the school year, I realized I had spent a significant portion of my earnings socializing with friends. This experience taught me the importance of budgeting and planning before making expenditures, a lesson that has continued to inform my financial decisions.Additionally, holding a part-time job instills a sense of responsibility. For instance, if a student takes a job but consistently arrives late, they risk losing pay or even being fired. Compared to the relatively minor consequences often faced in school settings, this real-world scenario teaches the importance of following rules and being accountable for one’s actions.In conclusion, to aid their children in adjusting to adult life, parents should encourage them to seek as many experiences as possible. As discussed, promoting part-time employment is an excellent strategy for preparing young people for the responsibilities of adulthood.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;"Growing up in a big city is undoubtedly advantageous for children, provided they are raised in a good neighborhood. I believe this for two primary reasons: academic and social benefits. Some people argue that children in big cities spend all their time indoors on computers or playing video games. However, that wasn't the case for me growing up in a community with peers my age. My friends and I engaged in outdoor activities like playing soccer, riding bikes, and climbing trees on a daily basis. While we did enjoy video games, they were just a part of our diverse range of activities. Big cities offer a wider array of people and opportunities for entertainment.I have a friend who was raised in the countryside and mentioned how challenging it was for him to study extensively just to pass the university entrance exams. This highlights a significant drawback of rural upbringing. In a big city, students often benefit from more qualified teachers and greater access to technology.Living in the countryside can be quite limiting; you may not meet as many people, and rumors can spread easily. If I ever have children, I'm confident that I will ensure they grow up in a good neighborhood in a vibrant city, where they can thrive and be truly happy."
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;I wholeheartedly believe that parents are the best teachers. Children often perceive their parents as uniquely special, which makes them the most significant figures in their lives.To begin with, the words parents choose to use carry immense weight with their children, far surpassing the influence of friends or other adults. For instance, if a child hears from a peer that an action is wrong but their father insists it is right, the child is likely to side with the father, regardless of whether he is mistaken.Additionally, children typically spend more time with their parents than with anyone else, allowing parents greater opportunities to educate and influence them. This close bond fosters more meaningful interactions and deeper connections.Moreover, children tend to emulate their parents. This aspect is crucial because even when parents do not consciously aim to teach, their children are constantly observing and absorbing lessons from their behavior. For example, if a father exhibits abusive behavior toward his partner, it is likely that the child will grow up to replicate similar disrespectful attitudes toward others.In conclusion, I firmly believe that parents are the most impactful educators. They should exercise caution in their words and actions around their children, as these experiences will shape the individuals their children become.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;Technology has made significant strides in recent years, greatly simplifying the process of food preparation and enhancing flavors compared to the past. This advancement has positively impacted people's lives in various ways, particularly by granting them more free time and enabling them to create delicious meals without requiring exceptional cooking skills.To begin with, many individuals have busy schedules and limited time to spend in the kitchen. The ability to prepare tasty meals simply by placing them in the microwave or oven is incredibly convenient. For instance, if an engineer is working on a project due tomorrow, he can save hours by using a microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Moreover, preparing a delicious meal alone used to demand advanced cooking skills, but today it’s much easier to make healthy and flavorful dishes. For example, if someone wants to impress a date with dinner, they can now purchase pre-packaged food that comes with straightforward instructions—usually just requiring them to place it in the oven and wait.In summary, the convenience of food preparation has significantly enhanced people's lives, primarily due to technological advancements. However, individuals should remain mindful of their dietary choices, as some processed foods can be detrimental to health, so it's wise to stick to well-known brands.
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The current debate revolves around whether schools should mandate regular standardized exams for students. This topic is significant, as many people question the effectiveness of such assessments today. However, I believe that standardized testing plays a crucial role in the educational system by providing teachers with insights into whether students are genuinely absorbing knowledge.To begin with, standardized tests offer a fair method for teachers to evaluate student performance. For instance, some students may not actively participate in class discussions because they already understand the material. In such cases, exams serve as a vital tool for educators to gauge the true abilities of these students. Furthermore, many teachers depend on exam results when determining final grades, making standardized tests a preferred choice for maintaining fairness in assessment.Additionally, standardized tests present students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge practically. Some students might become accustomed to passively copying solved problems from the board, which prevents them from developing independent problem-solving skills. Standardized tests encourage students to engage actively with the material, thereby fostering their ability to tackle challenges on their own. Thus, it is evident that requiring standardized exams can benefit both teachers and students alike.Finally, I believe that mandating standardized tests is a wise decision, as it allows teachers to compare the knowledge levels of different students. In any classroom, there will always be students with varying degrees of academic performance, and standardized testing helps educators identify those who may need additional support. I align with those who advocate for standardized testing, as it enables teachers to allocate their time and resources more equitably among students.Ultimately, I feel that schools that require their students to take standardized tests are making the right choice. This approach not only allows for a thorough evaluation of whether students receive a quality education but also ensures that educators are held accountable for their teaching effectiveness.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";"The well-known proverb ""Knowledge is power"" highlights the importance of education. I believe universities should offer free education to aspiring students, as many reputable institutions currently charge exorbitant fees, creating challenges related to affordability. I've noticed that numerous dedicated students are unable to gain admission to prestigious universities because they must balance work and studies, often resulting in their prioritizing employment over education.As universities increasingly resemble profit-driven enterprises, the issue of affordability has become a pressing concern for students. In today’s world, the cost of education is skyrocketing, pushing individuals to seek self-financing options just to gain admission. Additionally, aspiring students encounter numerous challenges beyond simply meeting educational prerequisites, grappling with expenses such as accommodation, food, transportation, and clothing.Moreover, managing both work and study is no easy feat. Scholars require focus on their academic pursuits, particularly those pursuing MPhils and PhDs, as their research demands full concentration and extensive study. The prospect of free education would motivate these committed individuals who genuinely wish to earn degrees from esteemed institutions.Therefore, universities should pay attention to the challenges faced by many students. Their mission should prioritize education over profit, inspiring those eager to learn. If they embrace this vision, we can create a more educated society and improve our literacy rates."
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;While university professors are primarily known as teachers responsible for imparting knowledge, we cannot overlook another significant aspect of their roles: research. I believe that professors should prioritize research over teaching for several reasons.Firstly, a professor is fundamentally a researcher or an expert in their specific field of study. Maintaining a passion for their discipline is essential, as it drives personal and professional growth. This continuous engagement with research ultimately enhances their teaching effectiveness. For example, one of my most inspiring professors at university was Mr. Yang, who consistently engaged in research and literature. His enthusiasm not only enriched our learning experience but also taught us how to study more efficiently on our own. My classmates and I rated him AAA, recognizing him as an exceptional educator.Secondly, while students can access knowledge through textbooks, online resources, and lectures, they rely on professors when it comes to participating in research and advancing their academic pursuits. If a professor is not actively involved in research, they are unable to provide opportunities for students to engage in meaningful projects. Moreover, professors immersed in their research are constantly generating and exploring new ideas, which can inspire students to think creatively and contribute innovative suggestions—a mutually beneficial dynamic.Lastly, university professors represent a valuable asset to society, serving as leaders across various fields including science, arts, and culture. Their research drives advancements in technology, preserves cultural artifacts, and expands our understanding of history. Without their contributions, progress in these areas would stagnate.In conclusion, professors should dedicate a significant portion of their time to research throughout their academic careers. This commitment not only enhances their teaching but also fosters a thriving educational environment.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;There is no doubt that television and movies impact people's behavior, shaping us in both positive and negative ways. However, I believe that, on the whole, their influence tends to be more detrimental than beneficial. They encourage unhealthy eating habits, reduce quality time spent with loved ones, and promote a disconnect from one's true self.Many viewers snack while watching TV, often consuming unhealthy options like chips and pizza. It's common knowledge that these foods are not conducive to good health. Companies exploit this behavior by advertising these unhealthy products, prompting increased consumption and contributing to a rise in obesity-related health issues.Moreover, television and movies often result in people, especially children, spending more time on the couch rather than engaging with family and friends. As screen time increases, meaningful communication with parents decreases. Even when watching together, families tend to talk less than they would if they were playing interactive games.Today’s media is also filled with advertisements that portray unrealistic ideals, leading viewers to feel inadequate about their own appearance. When people see idealized images of beautiful men and women, they may perceive themselves as unattractive, prompting them to spend money on beauty products or gym memberships in pursuit of those ideals. Similarly, when influential characters in movies are shown smoking, admirers may feel encouraged to mimic that behavior, even if they previously had no interest in smoking.While I recognize that television and movies can be entertaining, I believe they often lead to negative behavioral influences. To maintain good health, stay true to oneself, and foster relationships with family and friends, it is wise to limit time spent consuming these forms of media.
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;Many travelers enjoy visiting museums in new destinations, while others may not share this interest. Personally, I prefer to explore museums when I’m in unfamiliar places, as they offer valuable insights into the culture, traditions, and history of those regions.One reason people choose to visit museums while traveling is the wealth of information they provide about the local history and culture. Additionally, museums can serve as great venues for making new friends and engaging in conversations, as the knowledge gained from visits often enriches social interactions.On the flip side, some individuals find museum visits to be the least exciting part of their trips. My cousin Pedro, for example, absolutely detests traditional museums. However, he surprisingly enjoyed his visit to the renowned Madame Tussauds in London. The experience, a unique blend of art and entertainment, not only entertained him but also deepened his appreciation for the artists' work and broadened his respect for various art forms showcased in other galleries.In summary, museums serve as visual gateways to understanding the history, traditions, and cultures of places around the world. I believe they are both enjoyable and educational experiences.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"A famous figure once remarked, ""A man's manner is like a mirror reflecting his virtues."" In today's fast-paced and bustling society, where distractions abound, many people seem to pay less attention to their behavior and manners, often treating others rudely. Some suggest we shouldn't expect politeness from others, but I firmly disagree. Here are my reasons.Firstly, individuals who demonstrate good manners tend to leave a positive impression on others. Such impressions help people connect and integrate into their communities more smoothly. For instance, when I started working at a new company, my good manners and respectful treatment of colleagues made it easier for me to be accepted by my peers and acknowledged by my employers. Conversely, if I had been rude, it would have hindered my ability to build relationships, likely leading to my dismissal.Secondly, polite interactions foster mutual respect among individuals. Courtesy and kind words not only enhance the speaker's reputation but also uplift those who are on the receiving end. Successful organizations thrive on relationships built on respect and goodwill. Numerous studies indicate that people who practice politeness are more likely to succeed, as their behavior encourages others to recognize their own dignity.Lastly, society as a whole requires a civilized atmosphere and order. The level of social civility is directly tied to the qualities of its individuals. To create a better environment for ourselves and future generations, it is essential that we embrace politeness and good manners. By adopting these principles, we can contribute to a noticeable decrease in crime rates and foster a healthier community.In conclusion, I believe that maintaining politeness in our busy and crowded world is crucial for the well-being of society."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;There is a well-known saying that failure is the mother of success. This idea leads some to argue that the challenges faced in early life can serve as invaluable lessons for the future. Conversely, others believe this isn't necessarily true. Personally, I align with the former perspective, asserting that overcoming tough experiences can significantly aid individuals on their life journeys.First and foremost, hardships help individuals appreciate and value the simple yet beautiful moments in life, such as a sunny day or a delightful breakfast. Those who maintain such a positive outlook often have a better grasp of finding genuine love, rather than being consumed by greed, which can lead to self-loss. Consequently, experiences of struggle teach individuals how to maintain a positive mindset and confidence in themselves.Moreover, individuals who have weathered numerous difficulties tend to remain calm in times of trouble. Having already navigated various challenges, they have a clear understanding of what to do during crises. Such resilience increases their chances of achieving career ambitions, as they know how to guide others toward success, regardless of the obstacles they may face.In conclusion, embracing challenges and valuing life’s simple pleasures leads me to believe that tough experiences are indeed invaluable assets on the journey of life. It's essential to recognize that fear of difficulties may lead to constant turmoil.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;In my opinion, I firmly believe that living in a city is significantly better than residing in the countryside. To begin with, cities offer a superior education system. Schools and universities tend to have better facilities, attracting renowned professors who prefer to work in such environments. Furthermore, I believe that urban areas provide greater job opportunities compared to rural regions. There are not only more jobs available, but they are also typically better-paying. While the cost of living in a city is higher, the increased income often offsets this expense. Additionally, cities are home to a diverse population, which enhances cultural variety. Engaging with different people and their traditions can be a truly enriching experience, potentially influencing one’s own habits and perspectives. Moreover, urban areas boast well-organized transportation systems. Public transit, like buses and trains, runs more frequently than in rural areas, facilitating better connectivity.On the other hand, the countryside offers numerous spots for relaxation due to its natural surroundings. Its peaceful environment can also help alleviate stress and sadness.Overall, I believe that city living is far more advantageous in today’s world due to the opportunities it presents. In contrast, rural life often revolves around an agrarian lifestyle, which I see as lacking in prospects. Given the choice, I would undoubtedly choose to live in the city.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;As the economy evolves, people are increasingly accumulating wealth and becoming more attuned to their mental needs, such as happiness. While I acknowledge that some individuals find joy in their work, I contend that, for the majority of us, the quality of our living environment is more significant than our jobs.It's true that work can contribute to happiness. A job can provide a sense of purpose and earn individuals respect, fostering feelings of achievement and self-confidence. Additionally, employment offers financial stability.Nevertheless, individuals should prioritize their living environment over their jobs. For most, work serves primarily as a means to support their lives. Very few derive lasting happiness from their careers, especially considering the burdens of decades-long employment. For instance, workers at FOXCONN, a major manufacturer for Apple, often perform repetitive tasks for more than eight hours a day. Such monotonous labor typically leads to fatigue and frustration, diminishing any sense of happiness.Furthermore, a beautiful environment is a fundamental human need, essential for overall well-being. Without it, people struggle to experience happiness and may instead grapple with anxiety. Unfortunately, rapid economic development is taking a toll on our environment. Factories are polluting rivers and soil at alarming rates, and urban expansion often comes at the expense of vast forested areas. In China, residents living near toxic manufacturing sites have suffered from health issues due to pollutants, experiencing serious illnesses such as cancer. Although these workers may benefit from job opportunities, the high wages cannot compensate for the health risks they face.In conclusion, it is crucial to prioritize the protection of our living environment over job concerns, as the ultimate goal for individuals is to lead fulfilling, healthy lives.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;"Technology is advancing rapidly, improving every day, and our communication methods are heavily reliant on it. Whether through voicemail, email, telephone, or traditional face-to-face interactions, I personally prefer email for three main reasons: its convenience, the ability to express myself honestly, and the fluency it offers during communication.It's widely acknowledged that email is a tremendous tool for staying connected. It allows people to communicate across vast distances; for example, someone in Vietnam can easily reach another person in the US—literally on the other side of the globe. Regardless of the distance, maintaining contact is never an issue. And if you happen to enter an incorrect email address, you’ll know immediately, eliminating any uncertainty. Plus, sending an email takes just a click, saving us valuable time.Moreover, writing emails helps individuals express themselves more honestly. Many people feel self-conscious during face-to-face conversations, which can hinder their ability to articulate their thoughts accurately. For instance, if I need to discuss a sensitive issue with a friend, like her behavior, it can be challenging to address it directly. Email provides a comfortable platform for me to convey my thoughts without the added pressure of direct confrontation. She can read my message at her own pace, which minimizes the chances of misunderstandings or annoyance.Finally, effective communication requires fluency, allowing people to understand each other clearly and retain information. In voice conversations or in-person discussions, reserved individuals may struggle to express themselves confidently. For example, when speaking with my parents, I often find it difficult to articulate all my ideas coherently. They might interrupt, which can throw me off track and cause me to forget what I wanted to say. Email gives me the opportunity to organize my thoughts systematically, making my arguments more persuasive.In conclusion, when comparing various methods of communication, I believe email stands out as the most effective option for most people. Its convenience saves time, while it also fosters honesty in our exchanges and ensures fluency, both of which are essential for persuasive communication."
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";"There are numerous engaging television programs that can be enjoyed at a minimal cost. When compared to other hobbies like attending the theater or sporting events, watching TV is a budget-friendly pastime that offers viewers various indirect experiences. However, in my opinion, the negative aspects of television outweigh the positives, as it often leads to a decline in meaningful conversations among people.To start, television shows can distract individuals from what truly matters. People with favorite programs may become so fixated on them during airing times that they neglect social commitments with family or friends, believing that these shows are essential to their lives. For instance, a friend of mine once canceled our basketball game just to watch his favorite show, ""Infinite Challenges."" This scenario highlights not only the impact on our basketball game but also on our friendship, which relies on regular interaction and communication. By choosing to watch television alone, my friend missed out on opportunities to strengthen our bond.Furthermore, even when people do watch television together, it often leaves little room for conversation. Watching a program side by side is almost indistinguishable from watching it alone, providing no real benefit to enhancing their connection. Studies show that most individuals avoid engaging in conversation with family members while watching TV. This behavior is understandable, as television doesn’t encourage interaction or participation.In summary, I strongly believe that sitting in front of the television hinders communication among family members, friends, and social groups. Television not only fosters obsession but also silences conversation, ultimately diminishing the quality of our interactions."
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;While many individuals prefer communication via telephone or in person, I personally believe that using emails or voicemails is more effective. I have several reasons to support this view, which I will outline in this essay.Firstly, emailing is a straightforward process. Many people find it challenging to call someone they don’t know well. In such situations, writing an email or leaving a voicemail can be much easier, as even those who are shy often feel more at ease expressing themselves in written form.Secondly, emails can be sent at any time of day. Personally, balancing work and university studies leaves me with little free time during the day. I usually get home around midnight and still need to answer queries and tackle routine issues. In such cases, I may not find it feasible to call someone or meet face-to-face, making it more convenient for me to leave a voicemail.Thirdly, composing an email allows for ample time to thoughtfully consider what to say and how best to articulate it. For instance, you can rearrange your phrasing or opt for a more suitable tone to convey politeness. In contrast, speaking in person doesn’t provide the same level of control over your words as writing an email does.Finally, sending an email ensures that you won’t disrupt anyone else's work or conversations. You don’t have to worry about interrupting important discussions or other tasks when communicating in this way.In conclusion, while I find both methods of communication viable, I prefer emails or voicemails for important but non-urgent matters.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;Firstly, making a quick decision often indicates a lack of thorough consideration and neglects to assess all relevant factors. As a result, these snap judgments frequently lead to undesirable outcomes. For instance, if someone chooses to quit their job without carefully contemplating their alternatives or having a backup plan, they may find themselves unemployed due to their impulsive choice.Moreover, rushing a decision can cause an individual to overlook valuable opportunities. In other words, if that person had taken the time to think things through, they might have discovered a different position within the same company, thus avoiding unemployment altogether.Additionally, hasty decisions not only result in wasted opportunities but can also significantly impact a person's life. For example, after quitting a job and facing unemployment, an individual might struggle to pay bills and afford basic necessities, leading to a drastic drop in their quality of life.Therefore, it is clear that quick decisions are often not wise. It is essential for individuals to take their time and carefully evaluate their choices to ensure they are making the best decision for themselves.
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;"In today's world, automobiles have become one of the most essential means of transportation for daily life. A significant number of people own cars and rely on them regularly, underscoring their importance. Overall, I firmly believe that cars have positively transformed modern living for various reasons.Firstly, cars enable individuals to cover long distances in a relatively short time, offering numerous benefits. This is particularly evident in maintaining relationships. Many people can sustain connections over great distances due to the ability to visit one another frequently thanks to their vehicles. Personally, my car has allowed me to see my childhood friends often, even while living in another city. Additionally, I was able to form a relationship with someone who lived 89 kilometers away. Our ability to meet on weekends has been crucial to our happiness as a couple today; without my car, our relationship would likely not have developed.Furthermore, cars enhance job opportunities by enabling individuals to commute to work and consider positions farther from home. They also provide greater flexibility. For instance, my father has traveled extensively throughout Germany for work, which has allowed him to earn a higher income. He would drive across the country for his job during the week and return home for the weekend. Without his car, he wouldn't have been able to spend time with his family, demonstrating the automobile's significant social and financial advantages.Lastly, owning a car encourages people to travel more frequently, expanding their horizons. Those without cars often find themselves staying in their hometowns or villages for the majority of their lives, relying on public transportation that may limit their access to certain destinations. There are numerous locations across the globe that are not served by public transport and are only reachable by car. Consequently, vehicle owners have better access to a wider array of places, allowing them to experience more of the world.In conclusion, the benefits of automobiles, such as enhanced flexibility in travel, social life, and employment opportunities, far outweigh the drawbacks of pollution they may cause. Flexibility is vital in nearly all aspects of life, and nothing offers more of it than having a personal vehicle."
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;"When selecting a career, it's essential to think carefully about the decision. People have varying opinions on whether to pursue a job akin to their parents' professions. From my perspective, opting for a job similar to one's parents' can be advantageous for one's career. Firstly, since parents operate within the same field, they can offer substantial support to their children, particularly in terms of domain knowledge and industry insights. For instance, my father, a software programmer, has taught me a great deal about programming and computer science. Whenever I encounter challenges, I turn to him for advice. His extensive experience allows me to save significant time when seeking solutions, making me more competitive compared to my peers. If I were to work in a different field, I would likely face far more obstacles than I do now.Furthermore, having worked for many years, parents often cultivate a robust network within their industry. They possess valuable insights and can provide considerable assistance to their children. For example, they can inform their children about companies that offer better benefits or educational opportunities. Additionally, their industry contacts might even help with writing recommendation letters for specific positions. In today's competitive job market, a strong recommendation letter can be incredibly influential. While others are still piecing together their resumes, someone with a solid recommendation may already have an edge in the interview process. Some may argue that since the job market is constantly evolving, pursuing a career similar to one's parents' may not always be the best choice. I acknowledge this perspective to some degree; however, trends are notoriously difficult to predict. The job market can change rapidly, making it nearly impossible to forecast which careers will remain in demand over the long term.In conclusion, when considering whether to follow a career path similar to one's parents', I've outlined several reasons why this choice can lead to greater support and guidance. I truly believe that parents can help navigate a smoother career journey for their children."
248;Do you agree or disagree: To make children do well at school, parents should limit the time that children spend on watching TV and movies.;In 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.First of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.Moreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?Admittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.;"In the 19th century, television emerged as one of the most significant inventions and has since become an indispensable appliance in every household. Its accessibility and engaging programs attract audiences from a wide array of ages and backgrounds. However, the increasing addiction of children to television has sparked extensive debate regarding whether their screen time should be limited. In my opinion, children should be restricted from excessive television or movie watching.To begin with, children often struggle with self-control, making it easy for them to waste significant amounts of time. One of the major challenges parents face is their children's tendency to prioritize TV over homework. I can relate to this experience; during my childhood, as soon as I returned home from school, my first impulse was to turn on the TV and remain glued to it for hours. I could watch endlessly, yet I found it difficult to focus on my homework for even a few minutes. While I could easily memorize the TV channels and programs, I barely retained anything from my textbooks, which negatively impacted my academic performance.Furthermore, many television programs are rife with violence and sexual content, which can be detrimental to children's development. Children lack the maturity to discern right from wrong and may mimic inappropriate behaviors they see on screen out of curiosity. Recently, there has been a rise in smoking among children who emulate the actions of characters in movies and television shows. Alarmingly, statistics indicate an increase in violent tendencies among children, with reports linking this trend to exposure to violent media. It is evident that many TV programs and films can adversely affect children's mental and physical well-being. How can we expect children to excel in school if they are influenced by such negative behavior?While it is true that some argue watching TV and movies provides children with valuable conversation topics for socializing with peers, I agree with this to some extent. However, this does not justify unlimited viewing without supervision or consideration of the content being consumed.In conclusion, I firmly believe that children's television and movie watching should be limited. Given their struggles with time management and immaturity in making sound judgments, it is crucial to ensure that their screen time is monitored and regulated."
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;"Professional athletes and entertainers often earn astonishing amounts of money that many find difficult to comprehend. For the majority of people who dedicate their entire lives to work, achieving such financial success remains out of reach. This significant salary disparity between these public figures and the average person raises the question: do these professional athletes and entertainers truly deserve their earnings? From my perspective, I firmly believe that they do.To begin with, a worker's salary typically reflects their skills and value within their profession. Thus, those who command high salaries must demonstrate exceptional talent and accomplish remarkable feats in their respective fields. Their earnings are not arbitrary; they result from their ability to stand out in a competitive world. All professions adhere to this principle, which is why the wealthiest athletes often coincide with the most outstanding talents, such as Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Additionally, these substantial salaries help ensure and support athletes' top-tier performances. While many people focus on the luxurious lifestyles of wealthy athletes, they often overlook the challenges they face and the significant investments they make in themselves. Their high earnings are a reward for their dedication and hard work; without adequate compensation reflecting their performance levels, we might not witness the extraordinary displays of skill that inspire and entertain us.Some may argue that the vast income gap between affluent athletes and ordinary citizens is unjust. However, I contend that as long as everyone has equal opportunities to pursue their dreams and careers, the system is fair. True fairness does not mean equal pay for all, but rather equal opportunities to achieve the same goals and accomplishments.In conclusion, the substantial salaries of athletes are not only a reflection of their achievements but also serve as a guarantee for top-quality performances. This compensation acts as positive reinforcement, encouraging more talented individuals to make contributions to the fields of athletics and entertainment, ultimately providing us with incredible experiences to enjoy."
250;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who canÕt accept othersÕ criticism canÕt succeed in group working.Ê;"In everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.First, the core of group working is ""consensus"". It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.Second, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: ""The good medicine tastes bitter“. Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.However, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.In conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident.";"In our daily lives, we interact with various people and receive a range of opinions about ourselves and our work, whether they are positive or negative. While accepting praise can be easy, embracing criticism often proves more challenging. This leads to the notion that individuals who struggle to accept criticism from others are less likely to thrive in collaborative environments. I personally resonate with this perspective.First and foremost, collaboration hinges on the concept of ""consensus,"" which underscores the importance of valuing everyone's input. In group settings, team members come together for brainstorming sessions, exploring every possible solution before arriving at a collective decision. Throughout this extensive discussion process, differing viewpoints will naturally arise. If one member clings stubbornly to their own ideas and dismisses criticism from others, the collaborative effort falters. After all, the project is a shared responsibility, not a platform for any one individual to showcase their ideas. Therefore, respecting the opinions of fellow team members is crucial.Secondly, the ability to accept criticism is a valuable trait, as it involves acknowledging feedback that may contradict your perspective. Even in situations outside of group work, being open to criticism remains essential. Though it can be painful because it highlights your shortcomings and compels you to confront them, criticism ultimately serves to identify those weaknesses and provides an opportunity for improvement—if you are willing to embrace it. Those who reject constructive feedback risk stunting their personal growth and development. In essence, an inability to accept criticism can hinder both collaborative efforts and individual pursuits. As a Chinese proverb aptly puts it, ""Good medicine tastes bitter."" Criticism can be a powerful remedy for improvement.Some might argue, however, what if the criticism is unfounded? What if I was correct from the beginning, but this seemingly logical criticism steered me astray? Isn't persistence also a valuable quality? I believe that even if you are right, criticism can still offer benefits. In such cases, it not only serves to refine your work, but also tests your understanding and knowledge of your subject. Accepting criticism doesn't mean you have to accept everything blindly—it's essential to engage your own judgment as well. The ability to effectively utilize constructive feedback is an important skill.In conclusion, criticism is vital, especially in collaborative efforts, but it also plays a significant role in other contexts. It acts like a discerning mirror, reflecting our flaws and encouraging us to strive for personal growth and increased confidence."
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;"Every parent hopes their children will excel and achieve success. To foster this, they begin cultivating their talents from a young age. Beyond fundamental subjects like language and science, music and art often appear on the list of essential skills parents want their children to acquire. I believe that children should engage with music and art early in life, as these pursuits offer numerous advantages.Firstly, childhood is an ideal time for developing an appreciation for music and art. Children are quick learners and possess a natural ability for creativity and imagination, which are crucial for engaging with these disciplines. Unlike math or language, music and art are less bound by rigid rules and more open to interpretation, allowing for greater creativity. Children enjoy the freedom to explore their imaginations without the constraints imposed by adult realities. Even their simplest artistic expressions—such as basic drawings or melodies—offer pure joy and unleash their imaginative potential.Secondly, investing in music and art provides lifelong benefits. These disciplines teach individuals how to appreciate beauty and express emotions creatively, enriching their spiritual lives. Thus, even if children do not become professional musicians or artists, learning these skills is still valuable; it nurtures their character and offers a fulfilling pastime.Nevertheless, some may argue that parents should not overwhelm their children with too many expectations, as acquiring many skills can feel burdensome. I think it depends on how we frame these activities. If a parent expects their five-year-old to practice piano for eight hours a day like a professional, that would indeed be excessive. However, during childhood, music and art should serve as gateways to the creative world rather than strict training grounds for honing specific skills, which can alleviate pressure.In conclusion, early childhood is the perfect time for children to explore music and art, which hold intrinsic value not only during youth but throughout life. These disciplines can enrich a person’s spirit as long as they are given the opportunity to flourish."
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;"There are numerous approaches to teaching. Some individuals believe that a strict and methodical presentation of theories in the classroom is the most effective method, while others argue that integrating practical applications of those theories is more engaging. Personally, I align with the latter perspective, as I believe the most compelling way for teachers to spark student interest is by demonstrating how a subject can be relevant and applicable to their lives beyond the classroom.To begin with, illustrating the relevance of a subject to daily life can leave a lasting impression on students, encouraging them to become more interested and proactive in their learning. For instance, when studying chemistry, simply memorizing the names of substances and their structural formulas can seem tedious. However, when students see real-life examples of chemical reactions occurring around them, their curiosity is piqued, motivating them to comprehend the theories discussed in class. During my senior year of high school, my chemistry teacher conducted an experiment illustrating how detergent dissolves oil, and then we learned to describe that process using formal structural formulas. This hands-on approach made learning more enjoyable and effective; I vividly recall the visual connection made during that experiment, even though I no longer study chemistry.Furthermore, connecting theoretical concepts to real-life situations provides students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and enhance their problem-solving skills. This real-world application captures students' interest because it involves active participation. For example, in a law class, students learn about their rights and responsibilities and how to apply legal principles to various scenarios they may encounter. When faced with such situations, they can think critically and determine how to respond.In summary, employing real-life experiences and examples to illustrate knowledge in a subject is a powerful method to engage students and maintain their enthusiasm for learning. This approach not only strengthens their understanding but also encourages them to practice and apply their knowledge independently."
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;"Environmental protection and economic development are arguably the most pressing issues of the 21st century, both critical to the future and well-being of humanity. However, with limited budgets and resources, governments often face the dilemma of prioritizing one over the other. I believe that addressing environmental challenges should take precedence over economic development for several reasons.Firstly, the urgency of environmental protection far outweighs that of economic development. Our planet, Earth, is unique and irreplaceable; without it, all our remarkable constructions and economic successes ultimately mean nothing, as humanity would face extinction. Just as an individual requires a healthy body, all living creatures depend on a thriving planet.Secondly, the ramifications of environmental issues are broader and more profound than those of economic concerns. Environmental problems are global in nature, impacting every country without exception. For instance, global warming raises temperatures worldwide, affecting us all collectively. The melting ice caps not only threaten polar habitats but also pose a significant risk to island communities near the equator, where rising sea levels can lead to devastating consequences. Environmental challenges transcend national borders, binding all humanity to our shared home, Earth.Some may argue that economic issues are equally global and critical, warranting equal attention. They might claim that severe economic downturns can lead to social unrest, whereas environmental problems often manifest as gradual, chronic issues. However, we are already witnessing alarming signs of climate change and environmental crises. It is unwise to ignore these pressing realities while prioritizing economic growth, especially since economic development often contributes to environmental degradation.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic development in terms of urgency and the scope of its impact. As previously mentioned, how can a person thrive if they are unwell? Similarly, how can we find safety and happiness in a world that we have, paradoxically, allowed to deteriorate?"
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;Opinions vary widely on whether the number of cars will decline in the next twenty years. Some individuals argue that increased environmental awareness will lead to reduced car usage, while others maintain that having a personal vehicle is essential for daily life. Both viewpoints have their merits and are reasonable. However, I personally support the notion that car usage will decrease over time, and I will outline my reasons below.Firstly, public transportation has improved significantly, making it far more convenient to use subways and buses. For instance, I reside in a city notorious for its morning traffic jams and lack of parking spaces. With the growing number of stations, many people now prefer taking public transport rather than driving themselves.Secondly, personal vehicles contribute substantially to various forms of pollution. As environmental awareness increases, individuals will likely reconsider their driving habits. For example, if we could transport forty people on a bus instead of having them each drive their own cars, we would alleviate traffic congestion and simultaneously reduce air pollution in the city.While I believe that car usage will indeed decrease over the next twenty years, I acknowledge that there are differing perspectives on this issue. Those who disagree might argue that personal cars are necessary because public transportation does not reach every location. While this is true for rural or hard-to-access areas, there are always alternatives for getting around—cycling or even walking can be viable options. Not only do these methods help decrease reliance on cars, but they also promote personal health.In conclusion, after considering the points mentioned, it is clear that a thoughtful evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages supports my stance that car usage will definitely decline in twenty years.
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;"In higher education, students enjoy a high degree of autonomy in their learning approaches. While some depend on classroom attendance to keep pace with their coursework, others feel confident enough in their abilities to skip classes, believing they can succeed in exams on their own. This variation in learning strategies raises the question of whether university attendance is necessary if students can perform well in assessments. In my view, attending class is crucial, regardless of exam results.Firstly, when it comes to acquiring knowledge, attending class offers advantages over solitary study. Courses are carefully designed, and professors possess a wealth of knowledge and experience that far exceeds that of their students. They not only impart information but also provide guidance that can help students achieve academic success.Secondly, it is a fundamental responsibility of students to attend class. Doing so demonstrates respect for both the professor and themselves. Many instructors factor attendance into their grading, meaning that class participation is often as important as exam performance. In fact, a student who excels in exams may still fail if they do not attend class.Some may argue that if students grasp the material well enough to pass the exams, attending class is a waste of time and that self-study is more efficient. However, I find this line of thinking quite presumptuous. Professors have the ability to offer insights and perspectives that students may not achieve on their own, thanks to their expertise and experience. Moreover, even the most confident students can benefit from engaging discussions with professors and peers during class.In conclusion, attending classes not only deepens learning but also reflects respect for the educational process. It is an essential part of the learning journey—passing exams is not the ultimate goal of education; rather, the learning experience itself is the most meaningful measure of a student's growth."
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;"What comes to mind when you see a stunning building? And what about when you encounter an airport? Surely, you don’t believe these structures came about by mere chance. The same goes for major websites like Google or Yahoo; it's absurd to think they were created randomly. While some attribute their success to luck, I must respectfully disagree. Let me explain my reasoning.Firstly, renowned individuals tend to be hard workers rather than just lucky. Dedication transforms someone into a true professional, making them effective in their field. Essentially, the more effort you invest, the less you leave success up to chance. Take a soccer game, for instance. When it comes to taking a penalty kick, the likelihood of scoring is statistically fifty-fifty. Yet, I'd argue that someone like Ronaldo has a higher chance of scoring than I do—not because he’s luckier, but because he’s practiced and trained extensively. His success stems from relentless hard work on the field, not from luck.Furthermore, relying solely on luck to achieve success is unrealistic. I don't intend to dismiss the influence of luck entirely, but it is not something we can depend on consistently. For instance, if you’re preparing for the TOEFL or any multiple-choice exam, you can’t just wing it and hope for the best, regardless of how fortunate you may be. Picking an answer randomly will likely lead to failure. The prudent approach is to study diligently to ensure success on those tests.Lastly, hard work is essential for acquiring knowledge and executing projects effectively. Even the luckiest individuals cannot manufacture a car or construct a towering building purely by chance. These significant undertakings require expertise, which is cultivated through dedication and experience. Successful people have put in the effort and gained valuable insights through their hard work.In conclusion, significant achievements demand hard work, not just luck. While luck can play a role in reaching our goals, it is secondary to the substantial effort we must invest to succeed."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;People have different preferences when it comes to learning styles. I believe that both self-directed learning and studying with a teacher can be beneficial. Learning with a teacher can clarify confusing concepts and accelerate the learning process. Additionally, for practical subjects, having an instructor is essential. However, there are times when I prefer to learn independently.An experienced teacher can make the learning experience faster and more manageable. When I tackle difficult subjects on my own, especially those with limited resources, I sometimes feel discouraged after investing significant time without progress. In such cases, I seek help from a teacher, who can convey the material efficiently in a shorter timeframe. This often leads to a more effective learning experience, preventing confusion and discouragement.Certain practical subjects require supervision or instruction. For example, acquiring skills in driving, medicine, engineering, or sports such as skiing and swimming necessitates the guidance of a qualified teacher. Trying to learn these skills alone is often impractical and inefficient. Moreover, self-directed learning can result in misconceptions. For instance, when I first attempted to learn guitar without a teacher, I developed poor strumming techniques and a flawed sense of rhythm. It wasn't until I worked with a tutor that I could identify and correct those mistakes, enabling me to play more effectively.Nonetheless, there are subjects I prefer to learn independently to avoid the expense of a teacher and the inconvenience of attending classes. In today’s world, there are numerous valuable resources available, such as books, e-books, the internet, and educational TV programs. I utilize these tools to guide my learning, especially for languages like English, through various helpful books and online platforms.In conclusion, both learning with a teacher and learning on my own can be advantageous at different times. Each approach has its unique benefits and drawbacks, and I find value in both methods.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;"Thanks to modern technology, individuals can now work from virtually anywhere, provided they have the necessary tools. The traditional office setting is no longer the sole workspace option. This rapid advancement raises the question of whether it's more effective to work from home with a computer and phone, compared to being in the office. Personally, I believe that working from home is less effective and less efficient than working in an office environment.Firstly, being in the office allows for immediate interaction with colleagues. Employees can easily seek assistance or collaborate on projects in real time. For instance, during a major project, if a team member has a new idea, they can quickly gather their colleagues to discuss it. This direct communication is much more efficient than conversing over the phone. Furthermore, if someone encounters issues with their computer or internet connection, they can promptly reach out to IT support for assistance.Secondly, working from home presents several drawbacks that can hinder productivity. Distractions are abundant in a home environment; people may find it difficult to focus with the temptation of television or snacks nearby. Additionally, without supervision, there’s a greater likelihood of procrastination. Moreover, remote workers may miss out on crucial office events, such as important announcements from management.In summary, working in the office is clearly more beneficial than working from home when it comes to efficiency. The office environment not only facilitates collaboration with colleagues but also fosters a professional atmosphere that cannot be replicated in a home setting."
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;"Success is a universal aspiration, and there are countless paths that can lead individuals to achieve it. Some opt for a conventional approach, waiting for opportunities to come their way, while others prefer to stand out from the crowd. Which approach is more promising for success? In my view, embracing your uniqueness can set you on the path to achievement.Firstly, being positively distinctive often signifies that you have accomplished something that surpasses the norm. In a competitive landscape, life resembles a survival game: those equipped with the finest tools can thrive. If you fail to differentiate yourself or lack a standout quality, you risk being overshadowed and replaced by someone more exceptional. Personally, during my college years, I was frequently selected as the group presenter for our reports because I was the only one who could articulate our findings clearly and confidently.Secondly, uniqueness allows you to cultivate your own value, something that cannot be replicated by others. When you possess qualities that set you apart, success becomes about actively shaping your identity rather than passively waiting for recognition. Take Apple, for instance; its remarkable success stems from distinctive qualities that outshine its competitors. Apple’s operating systems offer unparalleled performance, and its designs consistently capture consumer admiration. It is this uniqueness in design that establishes Apple’s intrinsic value.In conclusion, being different and unique is a more effective route to success. It showcases your abilities and helps you carve out your own value, placing you ahead on your journey toward achievement."
260;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Younger school children (aged five to ten) should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science and history.Ê;Undoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.First of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. In addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.Admittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.In a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.;"Without a doubt, math, language, science, and history are crucial subjects in a student's education, as they lay the foundation for understanding the world. Consequently, some argue that younger students should not be required to learn additional subjects. However, I believe that art and music are equally vital for a young student's future, as these disciplines provide alternative perspectives on our planet and offer a reprieve from the immense pressures of contemporary life. Therefore, I strongly support the inclusion of art and music in the curriculum.Firstly, art and music expand students' horizons and foster deeper contemplation. It is widely recognized that art and music transcend national boundaries; they are universal expressions shared among people from diverse cultures. By studying these subjects, students can appreciate the works of renowned artists and musicians while experiencing the richness of various cultures. For example, students can immerse themselves in Beethoven's masterful ""Symphony No. 5,"" a piece that resonates with profound emotion and artistry.Furthermore, engaging with art and music provides effective outlets for stress and serves as a wonderful means of relaxation. In today's fast-paced world, individuals often face significant pressure from academic and professional demands, which can be overwhelming. Art and music offer accessible avenues for individuals to escape the stresses of daily life. For instance, when viewers contemplate a brilliant painting like the ""Mona Lisa,"" they can momentarily set aside their burdens and ponder the meaning behind its enigmatic smile, allowing themselves to be enveloped in the beauty of art, which can alleviate their anxiety. This appreciation for art is rooted in the foundational experiences gained through its study.It is important to acknowledge that students' engagement with art and music should stem from their personal interests. If students resist these subjects, their educational value diminishes. Therefore, schools should consider replacing some core science classes with art and music courses to nurture students' interests in these areas without adding to their academic stress.In conclusion, in our modern society, where a comprehensive understanding of the world's complexities is essential and individuals grapple with considerable pressures, the education of younger students in art and music should hold equal importance."
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;When discussing generational issues, it's common for people to have differing viewpoints. Some argue that there's minimal change from one generation to the next, while others assert that generational differences manifest in a multitude of ways. Personally, I believe that perspectives between generations evolve, and the challenges faced by today's generation are notably distinct from those encountered in the previous one.Firstly, the workforce today grapples with complexities arising from globalization and industrial integration. Success now hinges on the ability to swiftly adapt to this rapidly changing environment. In the past, mastering a single skill often sufficed to tackle workplace challenges, as industries tended to be smaller and more straightforward. However, as they expand and enter the global arena, individuals are now expected to possess a diverse skill set to meet these demands. For instance, engaging in international business necessitates not only proficiency in one’s profession but also strong language skills. Additionally, the prevalence of financial crimes in the 21st century has increased the need for experts who can navigate both legal and financial landscapes.Secondly, today's generation faces issues of self-discovery that were less prevalent for their predecessors. The previous generation enjoyed limited freedom and typically followed the paths laid out by their parents. In contrast, young people today are exposed to a plethora of creative ideas and are encouraged to think independently. They are eager to explore their identity and determine their true desires. While it is a privilege to grapple with these dilemmas, it is certainly not an easy task. Young individuals must navigate an abundance of choices and bear the responsibility for the outcomes of their decisions.In conclusion, the challenges confronting today's generation are more intricate and varied compared to those of past generations, whether in the realm of careers or self-identity. While it may be difficult to ascertain which generation faces the greater difficulties, it is clear that future generations will encounter an entirely new set of challenges awaiting them.
262;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.First of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.Second, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won’t be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.;Opinions vary significantly on whether possessing extensive knowledge across multiple academic disciplines is more advantageous than specializing in a single subject. Some argue that a wide-ranging education enhances one’s chances of success, while others contend that expertise in a specific area is the key to achieving success. Both perspectives have merit and are worth considering. In my view, having a broad base of knowledge is essential for success, and I will outline my reasons below.To begin with, familiarity with various fields makes it easier to build relationships. For instance, during my time at a large company with multiple departments, I worked in the Management Information Systems department. Our daily tasks involved resolving client inquiries, some of which fell under the purview of the Engineering department. Because I had taken several engineering courses, I could engage in meaningful discussions with my engineering colleagues, allowing for smoother collaboration. This ability to connect with others not only helped me gain popularity but also facilitated my access to the assistance I needed.Moreover, having a diverse foundation of knowledge becomes crucial when transitioning to a different career path. My cousin Jeff and his friend provide a fitting example. Both majored in finance during their college years, but after graduation, Jeff took the leap into the art world, thanks to the extensive art history he studied in his free time. This knowledge enabled him to join a successful team, while his friend, who only focused on finance, found himself limited to a banking job.Despite my belief in the importance of a broad knowledge base, I recognize that some may argue differently. Critics might point out that if someone struggles to succeed in their chosen field, their prospects in other areas seem bleak. While this viewpoint has validity, one must consider the possibility of discovering hidden talents in an unexpected field later on. In such cases, the initial struggle would not be a barrier at all.In conclusion, after examining the advantages and drawbacks of having expertise in various disciplines versus a single field, it is clear that I stand on the side advocating for a broad knowledge base. The benefits of understanding different subjects are significant and contribute greatly to one's overall success.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;"I have my own reasons for agreeing with the assertion that successful individuals embrace new experiences and take risks. There are various opinions about the key traits of successful people, but I believe one crucial aspect supporting this idea is that they gain valuable insights by stepping outside their comfort zones. Furthermore, significant success often necessitates undertaking substantial risks.Successful individuals encounter unique and valuable experiences that can only be gained by exploring new avenues. For instance, if you wish to improve your communication skills, trying your hand at sales in different stores can be enlightening. Engaging with a variety of people with diverse behaviors and personalities will teach you how to navigate different scenarios in the future. These valuable lessons cannot always be found in textbooks; they come from real-life experiences.Moreover, I am convinced that achieving great success requires embracing significant risks. To achieve high returns on investments, you may need to invest large sums into risky financial ventures that could result in substantial losses. Similarly, if you aim for outstanding performance in a crucial exam, it may require sacrificing your leisure time and hobbies for intensive study. The more risks you are willing to take, the greater achievements you will likely attain. Without taking risks, you may lead a life of mediocrity with average accomplishments. Hence, taking risks is essential.In conclusion, I firmly believe that success, experimentation, and risk-taking are interconnected, and to attain success, one must embrace these elements."
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;First, it is essential to understand the theoretical foundation of our future profession, which we can primarily acquire through education. School provides us with the opportunity to recognize the necessary skills for our desired career and to focus on mastering them. By committing to our studies, we enhance our chances of excelling in our jobs and executing tasks more efficiently in the future. For instance, anyone aspiring to be a successful industrial engineer should thoroughly engage with technical courses to ensure they can effectively apply the knowledge in their professional life. Clearly, studying diligently in school is a vital factor in job success.Another key component of finding success in a career is effective communication. By building strong relationships with others, we cultivate a wide network of contacts. This network can yield numerous benefits. For example, if you are seeking job opportunities, maintaining good relationships with potential employers can help you achieve your goals. Additionally, if you work in sales, establishing rapport with customers can lead to increased loyalty and repeat business. Thus, the ability to connect well with people is also an important factor.In conclusion, while some may disagree, I have outlined my reasoning and examples above to illustrate that no individual factor is sufficiently strong on its own. It is essential to recognize the importance of both strong communication and academic dedication, as each offers its unique advantages.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;Advertising is increasingly woven into the fabric of modern society, influencing people's choices in various aspects of life. This raises the question of whether advertising has a positive impact on our lives. Some argue that advertising is responsible for unhealthy eating habits, while others contend that numerous factors contribute to people's decisions. Personally, I believe that advertising is not the primary cause of unhealthy eating behaviors.Firstly, advertising does not solely dictate individual eating habits. The foundation of a healthy diet lies in people's understanding of balanced nutrition and their ability to exercise self-control. While advertising often presents products in an enticing manner—regardless of potential negative effects on health—it is not the sole source of information. Individuals can seek diverse perspectives on food from various outlets, including news articles and magazines. If people are well-informed about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and actively monitor their dietary choices, they can successfully resist temptation. Blaming the advertising of fast-food companies for personal weight gain lacks credibility if individuals do not reflect on their own behaviors.Secondly, in a time when many individuals are becoming more health-conscious, numerous companies are responding to this trend by promoting healthier food options. In fact, advertising can contribute to better eating habits. For instance, the rise in organic food products—marketed as being grown without pesticides—and those with reduced salt or sugar content illustrate this point. These advertisements focus on positive health aspects and can lead to improved dietary choices. In this context, the advertising industry raises awareness of the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.In summary, advertising is not the primary contributor to unhealthy eating habits. The real determinants are the understanding of healthy eating practices and self-discipline. Additionally, advertising can promote healthier eating trends in response to the growing awareness of the importance of a better lifestyle. While it is impossible to avoid a world filled with advertisements, our freedom to choose remains intact. Ultimately, we have the power to determine our own lifestyles.
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";"In today's world, there are many resources available for entertainment, education, and information. One significant resource is television; however, it can also have negative effects on individuals. As such, I believe that television has undermined communication among friends and family. Many people devote excessive time to watching TV, with some even eating while glued to the screen or prioritizing their viewing habits above all else.First and foremost, numerous individuals spend countless hours watching television instead of engaging with their loved ones. I know someone who turns on the TV first thing in the morning, even before breakfast. He records shows he misses during work hours, and when his wife attempts to converse with him, he typically only pays attention during commercial breaks. Consequently, she has adapted to this behavior and now prefers to send him emails. Time with family is invaluable, and many need to recognize its importance and strive for quality interactions.Another way in which television hampers communication is by preventing families from enjoying shared meals together. Meal times can be crucial moments for discussing school updates, projects, and personal concerns, especially for those with children. Additionally, during dinner gatherings with friends, conversations often falter due to the television being a distracting presence. In many cases, when families and friends come together to eat and socialize, the reality of their interactions is far less engaging.Lastly, some individuals prioritize television above all else. I recall a friend once telling me that she couldn’t host me at her house because she was watching a telenovela. I was honestly shocked that she would put a show ahead of our plans.As I mentioned, television can be a valuable tool for learning, entertainment, and staying informed about current events. However, I firmly believe that it has negatively impacted communication among friends and family when it becomes a priority, consuming excessive time and interrupting mealtimes."
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;"University students can generally be categorized into two groups: those who are less motivated to study and those who are diligent scholars. Typically, the latter group struggles to find time for exercise. It is widely acknowledged that engaging in physical activity for at least 30 minutes is essential for a healthy and fulfilling life. However, I believe that the funding allocated to academic resources like libraries and laboratories should not be equal to that spent on physical or social activities.From my perspective, excessive spending on gym facilities or the construction of sports courts is unnecessary to encourage student participation in sports. Take my roommate, Mary, for instance; she wakes up every morning at 6 AM and spends an hour exercising in a nearby park. When she returns to the dorm, she is full of energy and ready to tackle the day after a refreshing shower. As you can see, she stays active without spending any money. Instead, the university should focus on promoting the benefits of exercise through posters on campus, inviting athletes to give talks, and encouraging students to prioritize their physical health.Furthermore, students select their majors based on personal interests. It is essential for the university to provide adequate resources for students in physical education since their studies are entirely centered around physical activities. On the other hand, it seems unfair to prioritizethe funding of fitness facilities for engineering or medical students when their focus should be on well-equipped laboratories that foster innovation and learning in their respective fields.Lastly, funding allocated for social activities often appears to be a waste. Students wishing to socialize or meet new people typically do not rely on university-sponsored programs. For example, my friends and I prefer to spend time together outside the university, where we can enjoy privacy and avoid familiar faces.In conclusion, while I recognize the significance of physical activity in the success of university students, I argue that funding for sports and social events should not be equivalent to that of academic resources such as libraries and laboratories."
268;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. ;To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned, good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons. However, if one coniders the issue carefully, he or she may agree the title statement as I do.First of all, friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career. Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job. Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields, imagine when you are in trouble, you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you, so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible, even an esy phone call, instend of a series of complex solutions.Futuermore, no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company, relating well to people is also a importent issue. If top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them. Consequently, make a good relationship with them.On the other side, if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss, only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position.However, someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job. Studying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job. But imagine it, a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people, and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former, which person do you want to be? I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future.In my point of view, I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school.;Agreeing or disagreeing with the statement that good interpersonal skills are more important than academic achievement for securing a successful job in the future involves weighing the pros and cons. However, upon careful consideration, I find myself in agreement with this assertion.Firstly, friendships are invaluable in both our personal lives and careers. Being able to connect well with others can yield significant benefits for future employment. Possessing strong relational skills means having a network of friends across various fields. When faced with challenges, having these connections can provide immediate support—often just a phone call away—making it easier to find solutions rather than navigating complex issues alone.Moreover, regardless of whether one is a top-level manager or an entry-level employee, the ability to foster good relationships is essential. For managers aiming to make a project successful, establishing rapport with their subordinates is a prerequisite for effective collaboration. Managers should listen to their employees' needs and concerns, showing patience and care, which ultimately strengthens their relationship.Conversely, for lower-level employees seeking to advance their careers, cultivating a positive relationship with their supervisors is equally important. If an employee is viewed favorably by their boss, they are more likely to receive opportunities for promotion.On the other hand, some may argue that specialized knowledge is more critical for future job prospects. Diligent study, a strong resume, and extensive knowledge can make graduates more competitive candidates. However, consider the following scenario: one person possesses excellent work knowledge but struggles with interpersonal skills, while another has strong relational abilities but is not as knowledgeable in their field. Many would likely choose the former when considering job qualifications, thinking it would provide them with better chances for future employment.In conclusion, I personally prioritize improving my interpersonal skills and expanding my network of friends over solely focusing on academic success.
269;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? As modern life becomes more complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize;With the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.First of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.Equally important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.Finally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs. At this circumstances, they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where. It is obviously a huge waste of time. But if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination.In this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with.;In today’s fast-paced world, life has become increasingly complex and challenging compared to the past. Consequently, it is crucial for individuals, particularly young people, to develop planning and organizing skills, as these can enhance efficiency and mitigate potential crises, while also eliminating unnecessary actions.Firstly, strong planning and organizational skills can make our efforts more efficient and productive. For instance, I used to feel overwhelmed by the demands of preparing for final exams, submitting papers, and completing internship work at the end of each term. However, this year, following my roommate John’s advice, I began using a to-do list to effectively organize all my tasks related to finals. This strategic planning allowed me to manage my responsibilities more effectively and ultimately helped me achieve a top rank in the class while tackling everything else.Moreover, the ability to plan and organize is vital for young people to prevent crises that could jeopardize their long-term efforts. In any workplace, employees are expected to generate profits for their supervisors and complete their tasks efficiently. Those who lack planning and organization skills risk procrastination, waiting until deadlines are approaching to take action. The reality is that deadlines can often change unexpectedly, with tasks due sooner than anticipated due to shifts in company schedules. In such cases, employees who did not plan ahead may struggle to meet revised deadlines, potentially facing penalties or even job loss. Such outcomes are unacceptable for anyone.Finally, some claim that the ability to plan and organize can be acquired once one starts a job, suggesting that young people do not need to focus on these skills now. However, these skills are essential for young individuals, as they can help them overcome bad habits and achieve their goals more efficiently. While searching for information online, young people can easily become distracted by online games or social media. Without a clear plan, they might waste hours on the internet without accomplishing anything. By making an initial plan and adhering to it, they could complete their tasks more quickly than they would have imagined.In an intricate society filled with numerous tasks, it is clear that the ability to plan and organize is an invaluable asset that young people must cultivate.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;In today’s educational landscape, many assert that attending classes greatly benefits students by providing them with diverse learning opportunities. Conversely, some argue that having the option to study from home allows students to avoid commuting time and expenses. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that attending classes is the more advantageous choice.Firstly, being present in class fosters communication among students, which is crucial for grasping new concepts. They can discuss and review material during breaks, enhancing their understanding. Without attending classes, students miss out on collaborative opportunities that can aid in tackling challenging subjects.Additionally, having direct access to teachers enables students to grasp ideas more effectively. Educators can provide thorough explanations and numerous examples, making the learning process more efficient. In fact, attending classes can expedite understanding compared to self-study, where students may struggle without guided instruction.Importantly, regular class attendance instills a sense of responsibility in students. It encourages them to adhere to discipline and develop perseverance when completing assignments. In contrast, those who study at home may lack structure, leading to disorganized study habits and the risk of missing vital information.In conclusion, the benefits of engaging with peers and receiving support from teachers in a classroom setting are undeniable. Attending classes not only enhances academic performance but also cultivates a disciplined approach to studying that ultimately fosters success.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;Telephones and email offer numerous advantages that have greatly enhanced my life. I don't agree with the idea that these forms of communication—telephones and email—make interactions less personal. I will provide several reasons to support my viewpoint.Firstly, telephones and email allow people who are far apart to maintain connections. Unlike traditional mail, which can get lost or delivered to the wrong address, telephones and email enable direct communication. For instance, I currently live in the U.S., making it impossible to see my parents in my home country in person. However, I can easily call them or send an email whenever I want, which helps me feel connected to them despite the distance.Secondly, telephones and email can often convey my thoughts more effectively than face-to-face interactions. Sometimes, during heated moments with friends, I struggle to express myself clearly. In those instances, taking time to reflect allows me to articulate my feelings and thoughts more thoughtfully and without the immediate emotion that might cloud the conversation. This shows how these methods of communication can still feel very personal.In conclusion, telephones and email allow me to connect intimately with those I care about, and they give me the opportunity to express my thoughts in a way that feels personal. Therefore, I firmly believe that telephones and email do not diminish the personal nature of communication between people.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;I strongly prefer living in a big city over the countryside. Urban areas offer numerous advantages and amenities that small towns cannot match. A person's upbringing and environment play a crucial role in shaping their future, as they influence personality and cultural development.Big cities are filled with social venues such as restaurants, museums, bars, sports clubs, cinemas, and theaters. Residents have a wide variety of options for leisure activities and opportunities to spend time with friends, unlike those in smaller towns who often have limited choices, possibly just a single bar or cinema for socializing.Educational opportunities are also significantly better in metropolitan areas, with access to more experienced and qualified teachers. In today’s world, a quality education is essential for securing a prosperous future. Individuals in big cities typically have a higher likelihood of landing well-paying jobs, as many companies are located in urban centers where job availability is greater than in small towns.However, living in a big city comes with its own trade-offs, such as sacrificing a quieter, more peaceful lifestyle and breathing fresh air. City dwellers often spend considerable time in traffic and commuting, as distances can be quite long. While every technology has its pros and cons, I personally prefer the conveniences of modern technology over the lifestyle of the 16th century, which lacked these advancements. Additionally, medical facilities in urban areas are far superior, and in my opinion, the benefits of improved healthcare outweigh the drawbacks of technological reliance.In conclusion, I believe that life in a big city is more exciting and enjoyable than in small towns, thanks to the abundance of social venues, technological advancements, superior education, and better medical services.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;You may have a passion for exploring new experiences and taking risks, even if you're not particularly skilled at them. This approach can help you broaden your horizons, discover aspects of your personality, and uncover new talents. However, it’s important to acknowledge that this ideal isn’t always achievable. If you spread yourself too thin, you might miss valuable opportunities to excel in other areas. Therefore, I firmly believe that focusing on your strengths is crucial.Concentrating on what you do well allows you to achieve your goals more effectively. The more time you dedicate to your strengths, the greater your chances of reaching something significant. Take Albert Einstein, for example. He is considered one of the greatest physicists in history, primarily because he devoted his life to developing theories in physics, ultimately formulating the special and general theories of relativity. He rarely focused on anything else and famously struggled with distinguishing between different types of soup, as he found using two different soups a hassle. This exemplifies the idea that concentrating on your strengths increases the likelihood of accomplishing your objectives.When you consistently engage in activities you excel at, you can improve even further. Success in these areas brings satisfaction and fosters greater interest, which in turn motivates you to strive for more. For instance, I was quite adept at math during junior high. My satisfaction with my abilities drove me to tackle more advanced math challenges. As a result, I not only achieved higher scores on math tests but also tackled university-level problems. Thus, by honing your natural talents, you can enhance your skills even more.In conclusion, concentrating on what you already do well leads to greater accomplishments and allows you to excel even further.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;One of the key traits of a mature adult is responsibility, particularly when it comes to financial matters. So, what is the best way to instill this sense of responsibility? There is much debate about whether to teach children financial responsibility at a young age or wait until they reach adulthood. Personally, I believe that children should learn to manage their own finances early on, for the reasons I will outline below.First and foremost, sociologists have found that our characteristics and personalities begin to develop early in life, even before we are born. Therefore, it is essential to teach children about financial matters as soon as possible. To illustrate my point, I would like to share a memory from my childhood. When I was seven, my father gave me a monthly allowance to spend as I wished. The first time I received the money, I spent it all on food at school and quickly ran out. When I asked my father for more, he refused. This experience taught me the importance of managing my money wisely. From that moment on, I learned to be economical, and now I have everything I want.Another important aspect of teaching children about money management is its impact on family finances. If parents indulge their children’s every desire, they may find themselves struggling to meet essential needs. Even in wealthy families, children who do not learn to manage their finances may grow up to be unappreciative and dependent, relying solely on their parents’ wealth. For example, I had a friend from a prosperous family whose parents gave him everything he wanted as a child. As a result, he grew into an arrogant adult who couldn’t support himself and constantly sought financial help from his family. Despite their attempts to help him learn financial management and career planning, his parents’ efforts were in vain. Tragically, one night, while partying with irresponsible friends in his luxury car, he crashed into a truck and lost his life. This not only caused extensive damage to property but also brought immense sorrow to his family.While some argue that children should be free to spend their money however they choose, I believe it is crucial to teach them financial responsibility from an early age. Our personalities are shaped during childhood, and changing these traits in adulthood is often quite difficult.

Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture.

The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves.

Whether they are participating in the dance or simply enjoying it as spectators, both dancers and audiences share in the joy.

It not only represents the beliefs and values of people but also highlights the civilization of a culture. Furthermore, dance serves as a means of entertainment for many. Therefore, dancing holds immense importance in every culture.
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;There are numerous debates about whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn factual information. While many believe that grasping ideas and concepts is paramount, I firmly assert that learning facts offers more significant advantages for students' future lives. Below, I will outline the reasons for my stance.First, when students focus on learning facts in school, they are better equipped to tackle real-life challenges after graduation. For instance, a solid foundation in factual knowledge helps students become more acquainted with reality beyond abstract concepts. Consequently, they are better prepared to face the issues that arise in their lives and solve problems effectively.Second, prioritizing factual knowledge enhances students' social skills. If students rely solely on theoretical concepts, they may struggle to understand human behavior effectively. A deeper comprehension of concrete facts allows them to analyze situations more accurately. Hence, by engaging with factual information, they can navigate social contexts more adeptly, ultimately improving their communication skills in everyday interactions.Furthermore, learning facts helps students manage their fears and uncertainties. When students grasp a fact and comprehend its implications, they are more likely to confront challenges with confidence. In my view, anxiety and fear can be detrimental to personal development, hindering an individual's ability to progress and excel in various aspects of life.In conclusion, I believe that learning facts is more advantageous for students in both social and personal contexts, as discussed above. By enhancing their social awareness and equipping them to face challenges with confidence, factual knowledge plays a crucial role in students' overall development and success.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;There is considerable debate over the significance of sports and social activities in comparison to core academic classes. The decision for students to participate in these activities is ultimately a personal one. While many believe that sports and social events are less crucial than academic subjects in college, I contend that they play an equally important role in students' lives. Below, I will outline the reasons behind my perspective.Firstly, sports not only contribute to physical fitness but also have profound effects on overall health. I believe our physical and mental well-being is closely tied to regular exercise. For instance, after a particularly grueling week of studying for exams last month, I found myself feeling drained and downcast. To restore my energy and mood, I decided to hit the gym, and it worked wonders! Consequently, engaging in sports is essential for students to maintain their health and vitality. Secondly, alongside academic knowledge, understanding social behavior is a crucial life skill. For example, students must be equipped to navigate society after graduation. Social activities allow them to become familiar with diverse perspectives and environments. In my view, participation in social groups and events is vital in preparing students for discussions and real-life social interactions. Therefore, these activities deserve equivalent financial support.Additionally, sports and social events foster happiness and enjoyment among students. Focusing solely on academics can become monotonous over time, leading to a lack of motivation. Engaging in these activities allows us to connect with peers and build friendships. For me, having more friends and experiencing new things cultivates a sense of joy and excitement. In conclusion, I firmly believe that sports and social activities should receive equal attention and funding, as detailed above. They provide numerous advantages and positively influence students' futures.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;"In today's society, the internet is regarded as one of the most significant inventions of the past century. Some individuals argue that it brings about various problems due to the information available online. Conversely, others contend that the internet offers a wealth of valuable information. I align with the latter perspective, as I believe the internet is a crucial source of daily information, knowledge acquisition, and global exploration.Firstly, everyone seeks to stay informed about global events in their everyday lives. Often, people need information that can assist them in their daily activities, which the internet readily provides. For instance, a businessman pressed for time may not have the opportunity to watch television or read newspapers, but he can easily access news updates and stock market information online.Furthermore, the internet enables individuals to gain a wealth of knowledge, making it one of the most valuable technologies available. Many, including students, can engage in online courses and watch educational videos from the comfort of their homes. This access to information is not limited to students; anyone can broaden their knowledge base. For example, those facing health concerns can research relevant information to better understand their conditions.Lastly, the internet effectively shrinks the world, which is a positive development. Individuals who may lack the time or financial resources to travel can nonetheless explore diverse destinations through the internet. They can view images and videos of interesting locations, as well as learn about various cultures and traditions, which enhances their understanding of different nations.In conclusion, many people appreciate the internet and often express gratitude for its contributions to education, business, and global exploration. With the invaluable information it offers, individuals can significantly enrich their lives."
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;University is a place where individuals acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for real-life application. Some universities mandate that students specialize in a single subject, while others encourage a broader curriculum involving multiple disciplines. In my opinion, studying a variety of subjects is more beneficial than focusing on just one, as it allows students to explore their interests, gain knowledge across different fields, and enhances their future career prospects.Initially, upon graduating from high school, many students find themselves uncertain about which subject to pursue in university. This confusion often arises because they have interests in multiple areas and wish to explore them all. For example, a student interested in science might also have a passion for music. Therefore, a curriculum that requires students to engage with a variety of subjects can significantly benefit them.Moreover, individuals who possess knowledge across a broad spectrum are generally more well-rounded than those who specialize in a single area. Engaging with diverse subjects enables students to acquire a wider range of knowledge. For instance, a business major may also gain insights into world history. Additionally, students benefit from new experiences by meeting peers and teachers from various backgrounds, allowing them to exchange ideas and insights.Lastly, those who graduate with a diverse educational background and a wealth of experiences have greater opportunities when it comes to career choices. Graduates are often equipped to pursue a variety of jobs, allowing them to select roles that align with their interests. For example, they can choose careers that not only match their aspirations but often come with higher salaries. Furthermore, having knowledge across different fields can open doors to lucrative opportunities.In conclusion, pursuing multiple subjects in university is preferable to specializing in one, as it provides students with broader knowledge, greater life applications, and increased opportunities for their future careers.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;While the development of technologies to explore our galaxy is indeed fascinating, it is crucial to remember that many individuals around the world still face poverty and hunger. Therefore, these technological advancements are of little value if they do not contribute to the well-being of people. In my view, governments should prioritize addressing the basic needs of their citizens.Firstly, in the aftermath of significant economic recessions, many individuals in various countries find themselves unemployed and without income. This lack of financial resources can lead people to resort to crime out of desperation. As a result, crime rates often rise, leading to a decline in the quality of life and increased unhappiness within communities. To counter this, governments should invest in job creation. When people have stable employment, they are less likely to engage in theft, resulting in lower crime rates and an overall improvement in quality of life.Secondly, environmental issues are another critical concern that affects everyone. Many industries continue to emit high levels of carbon dioxide, contributing to the greenhouse effect and climate change. These changes have far-reaching consequences for all living beings. Governments should address this challenge by implementing regulations to curb carbon emissions. Additionally, investing in alternative energy sources, such as solar energy, instead of relying on coal, is essential. A healthier environment leads to a better quality of life for all.Lastly, the family unit is fundamental to society. When family members do not have the opportunity to spend time together, it can lead to issues that affect not only the family but also the broader community and, ultimately, the nation. Therefore, governments should initiate campaigns to promote family bonding. For instance, organizing weekly events that encourage families to gather can strengthen relationships. Strong family connections contribute to healthier societies and more stable nations.In conclusion, I firmly believe that governments should allocate resources to meet the basic needs of their citizens. Addressing the essential requirements of employment, a clean environment, and strong family connections are vital steps in improving people’s quality of life.

282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;Every individual is unique. While students may participate in the same educational system, their learning abilities vary significantly. Some students are quick learners, while others require more time to absorb the material. Therefore, basing teacher compensation on their students' grades is inappropriate and unfair to educators. For these reasons, I disagree with this idea.Firstly, teachers have the primary responsibility of imparting knowledge to students within a limited timeframe. They follow a set curriculum, and given the constraints of the school year, it is often impractical for them to focus on the individual needs of each student in a classroom setting. Teachers must cover a variety of topics according to a predetermined schedule. If they concentrate on only a few students, they risk not completing the curriculum, which could leave many students without critical knowledge they are supposed to acquire.Secondly, students exhibit diverse learning capabilities. It is unrealistic to expect all students to grasp lessons at the same pace. While some may fully comprehend the material being taught, others may struggle. Consequently, test results will vary, reflecting the different levels of effort each student invests in their studies, rather than the effectiveness of the teacher. Therefore, it is unjust to link teachers' salaries to their students' academic performance.Finally, if schools were to compensate teachers based on students' grades, it could lead to significant issues concerning the quality of education. Educators might prioritize grade inflation to secure higher salaries, rather than genuinely focusing on helping students understand the subject matter. This scenario should be avoided at all costs, emphasizing that student grades should not be a criterion for evaluating teachers.In summary, I strongly oppose the notion that teachers should be compensated based on their students' academic results. Teachers cannot give individualized attention to every student in a classroom, and students' learning abilities differ greatly. Moreover, linking teacher pay to student grades could lead to further problems in the educational system.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;When we watch films or television shows, many of us enjoy seeing virtuous characters rewarded and villains facing consequences. Conversely, some viewers prefer different outcomes. Personally, I appreciate narratives where good people receive their due, but I believe it's important that these stories don’t always conclude happily.To begin with, if every story ends the same way, it quickly becomes monotonous. When good characters consistently triumph, the endings become predictable and, as a result, lose their allure. Conversely, if good characters don't always succeed, audiences will be compelled to watch until the conclusion to discover how it unfolds. For instance, traditional Hollywood tales often end with the hero defeating evil and finding love, but many, including myself, are growing weary of this formulaic approach. Repeatedly offering the same type of resolution diminishes its impact, suggesting that we shouldn't always grant good characters a happy ending in films and television.In reality, good individuals sometimes face unfortunate outcomes, and I believe this occurs more frequently in everyday life than in cinematic stories. If children are consistently exposed to narratives where virtuous characters are rewarded, they might come to believe that this is the norm in real life, leading to a misconception. They may strive to be good merely for the sake of reward, and when they inevitably discover that doing good doesn’t always yield positive results, they may become disheartened and less inclined to act virtuously. It’s crucial to convey to young audiences that good people engage in noble actions regardless of the outcome.While positive resolutions can be inspiring and encourage people to do good, as I mentioned earlier, such motivation may not be sustainable, as they will eventually confront reality. Therefore, I advocate for narratives that reflect the truth. If characters can embrace goodness regardless of their circumstances, audiences can appreciate genuine morality.In summary, I believe movies and television shows should offer a diverse range of narratives where good people may either receive rewards or face unjust outcomes.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;"Distance learning offers numerous benefits, but it should not serve as a substitute for traditional classroom education. Classroom learning not only imparts a wealth of knowledge but also fosters social skills and teaches students how to address real-world problems. Therefore, I firmly oppose the idea of replacing standard courses with online classes. I will present several reasons to support my perspective.Firstly, classroom learning provides students with a richer understanding of the subjects they study. Classrooms are equipped with various tools and resources that facilitate hands-on experiences. For instance, in a biology class, exploring anatomy by dissecting a frog offers significant advantages; students can learn how to use tools and view actual organs, which reinforces their understanding. In contrast, online classes often rely solely on textbooks and do not provide the same level of engagement with real-world scenarios.Secondly, online courses lack the opportunity for students to develop essential social skills. In a classroom setting, teachers can assign group projects that encourage collaboration and interpersonal interaction. These experiences are vital for helping students learn to navigate relationships and work effectively with others—skills that are rarely fostered in an online learning environment.Lastly, classroom education contributes to a healthier lifestyle for students by offering physical education classes that promote physical activity. With trained instructors guiding students in proper techniques, there is a lower risk of injury compared to exercising alone. This aspect of classroom learning supports students' overall well-being—something virtual classes cannot offer.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the notion of replacing traditional classrooms with online courses. Classrooms provide crucial hands-on experiences that enhance understanding, promote the development of social skills, and support healthy living through physical education. Therefore, in-person learning environments offer a myriad of advantages that online learning cannot replicate."
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;The various experiences I've encountered have significantly influenced my thinking. Many of these moments have enhanced my life in numerous ways. For instance, they've helped me improve my problem-solving skills, take better care of my health, and plan more effectively for the future. I will present some reasons to support my perspective.Firstly, my time at university has made me a more thoughtful problem solver. In particular, math classes taught me to approach problems methodically, starting by identifying the root cause and conducting research to find solutions. I've been able to apply this step-by-step method in my everyday life. For instance, when I need to travel to a new place, I analyze the different routes to determine which one is the quickest and most efficient. This approach has led me to discover more effective ways to solve various problems.Secondly, certain experiences have shown me the importance of self-care. For example, staying informed about healthy diets through news articles and reports has motivated me to choose better food options. As a result, I consistently buy high-quality organic products that are free from chemicals, helping me maintain my health. This experience has made me more conscious of my well-being.Finally, my experiences have also reshaped how I plan for my future. For instance, I learned that saving money for retirement is essential for long-term stability. Consequently, I’ve started changing my habits by cutting unnecessary expenses to ensure I can save for the long haul. This realization has encouraged me to take my future planning more seriously.In conclusion, the experiences that have shaped my mindset and lifestyle have made me a better person. They have enabled me to find improved ways to solve problems, become more health-conscious, and plan for my future thoughtfully. Overall, these lessons have led me to make meaningful changes in my life for the better.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;In today's world, proficiency in foreign languages is becoming increasingly important. Many individuals are eager to learn a new language, and there are two primary approaches to doing so. The first option is to study a foreign language in one's home country, while the second is to travel to a country where the language is spoken. I believe that studying a language abroad is the superior choice, and I will outline my reasons for this viewpoint.Firstly, immersing oneself in a different country provides an excellent environment for language learning. For example, if everyone around me speaks the foreign language, I am encouraged to enhance my skills in order to communicate effectively. If I struggle to communicate, I might even find it difficult to perform basic tasks, like buying food. This immersive environment motivates me to improve and become proficient in conversing with native speakers.Secondly, having friends who speak the target language can significantly accelerate the learning process. For instance, at an English school abroad, I would meet people from various backgrounds, with diverse native languages. English would be the common language for making friends, allowing me to engage in conversations without the fear of making mistakes. This kind of interaction helps me make quicker progress in mastering the language.In conclusion, I firmly believe that studying a foreign language in another country is preferable to learning it at home. The necessity to communicate with others and the opportunity to practice with friends in an immersive setting greatly enhance the learning experience. For me, learning a foreign language abroad is undoubtedly the best option.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;"Public utilities and the surrounding environment are crucial considerations when choosing a place to live. However, finding a community that fully meets our needs can be challenging. In my hometown, basic public utilities are mostly available, except for transportation. Consequently, my primary desire is for improved public transportation, as I face daily traffic congestion that appears to be worsening.To address this issue, there should be more options for public transportation, such as the introduction of a subway or sky train. This would offer residents greater flexibility in choosing how to travel. Currently, buses are the only form of public transport available in the area, leaving people with no alternatives. If we had subway and sky train services, it would enhance convenience for everyone. For instance, commuters can rely on train schedules for time estimates, something that is not possible with bus services. Furthermore, these improvements could contribute to reduced traffic congestion on the roads.Another significant issue is that the existing bus routes are limited to just two. This poses a major inconvenience; for example, if I want to reach a destination not covered by the bus routes, I must first take a bus to the central station before transferring to another one. This results in unnecessary delays. Expanding the number of routes would make transportation much more accessible.Moreover, increasing the variety of public transportation options could lead to a decline in the number of people using their personal vehicles. This shift would not only save individuals money on gasoline—which is becoming increasingly expensive—but it would also help conserve vital energy resources as people rely less on cars.In conclusion, transportation is a fundamental aspect that directly impacts quality of life. I hope that one day, this issue will be addressed, and that transportation in my hometown will become more efficient and convenient for everyone in the community."
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;Gathering feedback from various sources can significantly enhance performance. One effective approach to improving the quality of the education system is to solicit evaluations from students. Not only can this feedback empower teachers to enhance their effectiveness, but it can also lead to overall improvements in the educational framework. Therefore, I support the idea that students should be invited to assess their teachers.To start with, student evaluations can lead to better teacher performance. For instance, this feedback is akin to the insights that business owners seek from customers to refine their products. If students express concerns about a teacher's pacing, such as speaking too quickly for them to absorb the material, teachers can adjust their delivery to ensure all students grasp the information effectively. Thus, student evaluations play a crucial role in elevating teaching standards.Furthermore, evaluations from students can enhance the quality of schools. Improved teacher performance contributes to a stronger educational environment. When schools employ teachers who consistently perform well, the overall educational quality rises. For example, companies like Microsoft achieve success by employing high-performing individuals. Similarly, schools can cultivate intellectually capable students by retaining teachers who continuously seek to improve based on student feedback.Lastly, the primary beneficiaries of these evaluations are the students themselves. They are more likely to learn effectively from experienced and high-performing teachers who adapt their teaching styles to facilitate comprehension. As a result, students who attend schools with exceptional educators graduate equipped with the knowledge necessary for their future endeavors.In conclusion, I firmly believe that schools should encourage students to evaluate their teachers, as this practice promotes improved teacher performance. Additionally, it enhances the overall quality of the educational institution by fostering skilled educators. Ultimately, students benefit from more accessible learning experiences. Therefore, involving students in the evaluation process has significant advantages.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;Companies can range from small to large based on their context, success, and operational needs. Small businesses typically focus on local markets, while larger companies often operate on an international scale, serving not just their home country but also foreign markets. Personally, I lean towards working for a large company for several reasons.First, securing a job in a large company tends to be easier than in a small one. Large corporations are always on the lookout for skilled workers to help them with distribution, management, and sales across various countries. For example, when a large company opens a new branch in another country, it needs to hire additional employees to staff that location. Simply put, a larger company often means more job opportunities.Second, I believe that large companies are more likely to offer better salaries than their smaller counterparts. The size of a company usually reflects its level of success, which in turn allows it to provide higher wages. It’s generally understood that a well-known, globally recognized company can afford to pay more than a small local firm.Third, I have a passion for traveling. Large companies, known for their international presence, frequently host global conferences, meetings, and workshops, offering me the chance to travel to different countries and connect with new people. These events also provide opportunities to learn new skills relevant to my field.In conclusion, I can confidently say that I would prefer to work for a large company rather than a small one. My reasons include greater job availability, better salary prospects, and the opportunity to travel internationally for conferences.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;It is universally acknowledged that knowledge is essential for everyone. Colleges and universities play a vital role in equipping individuals with the academic skills necessary to achieve their goals. However, there is a debate surrounding whether access to these opportunities should be limited to high-achieving students or made available to all. This topic warrants further exploration.On one hand, many believe that colleges and universities should admit only those students who demonstrate academic excellence. The reasoning behind this viewpoint is that higher education often entails significant financial investment. Institutions prefer to avoid admitting individuals who may not meet the necessary qualifications, as this could lead to wasted resources and time on costly courses. Proponents argue that only those with a proven track record of success are likely to excel in rigorous programs, thereby leaving little room for average students to acquire advanced knowledge.Conversely, others contend that all students deserve an equal opportunity to pursue higher education. While it is true that attending college or university requires a considerable investment of both time and money, even average students should have the chance to prove themselves. With strong ambition and determination, individuals who may not initially be viewed as top students can still achieve their goals and experience personal growth. A supportive college environment can inspire these students to work harder and strive for a better future. Thus, providing access to education for all students, regardless of their initial academic standing, is crucial.In conclusion, I firmly believe that colleges and universities should be open to all students who wish to pursue their aspirations. This access allows students to learn, practice, and acquire valuable skills for their careers and futures. Attending college or university represents an invaluable opportunity that should be afforded to every student.
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;The topic of whether children should be permitted to play computer games is a contentious one, particularly given the argument that gaming is a waste of time. I hold a contrary viewpoint on this matter.Firstly, many students have developed an obsession with online gaming, which negatively impacts their academic performance. A study conducted by Beijing University found that 80% of students who failed their final exams played online games for two or more hours each week, while 90% of high-achieving students reported that they rarely engaged with computer games. Recent research also indicates that young people are particularly vulnerable to becoming immersed in these games due to their limited self-regulation.Secondly, children often gain little to no educational value from playing these games, rendering the time spent on them essentially wasted. Most games are designed for commercial gain and frequently incorporate themes of war, violence, and sexuality to capture children's attention. These themes are inappropriate for young audiences and can have detrimental effects on their development.It is true that a small number of students who dedicate significant time to gaming ultimately pursue careers in related fields. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the majority of students who indulge in these games often neglect their studies, sleep, and physical activity in favor of gaming. Instances of teenagers staying awake for days at internet cafes while gaming are not uncommon, and there have even been alarming reports about sudden deaths of young people in these establishments.In conclusion, I believe it is in the best interest of children to prohibit them from playing computer games. These games can be likened to cigarettes for adults, and we must implement regulations to manage this aspect of youth culture.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;When considering whether classmates or colleagues should collaborate on projects in person or via email, I believe that in-person interaction is preferable as it fosters better communication. Firstly, team members often have differing perspectives, and they need to arrive at a consensus efficiently. Clearly, face-to-face discussions are far more effective than email exchanges. A study conducted by Beijing University divided participants into two groups to discuss the budget for an activity. The first group met in person, while the second group communicated via email. The results showed that the first group reached an agreement in just 30 minutes, while the email group took a staggering 30 hours. Similar studies by other researchers have demonstrated that individuals can come to agreements more swiftly through direct conversation.Secondly, working in person can enhance both the quality and efficiency of a project, as it reduces the likelihood of conflicts among team members. Communicating via email about informal matters can lend an official tone, making recipients feel anxious or potentially offended by the written words. In contrast, when discussing the same topics in person, participants are likely to feel more at ease, as their responses aren't recorded and they won't misinterpret informal exchanges as formal declarations. This reduction in misunderstandings leads to fewer conflicts and better communication within the team.Of course, there are times when emails are necessary, particularly if team members are not located in the same place. While emails may not be the most convenient option, they are still preferable to having no communication at all. However, for classroom or campus projects, it is often the case that all project members are nearby.It’s important to recognize that projects require significant coordination, and relying on email for every opinion can lead to an overwhelming number of messages, creating a less effective experience. In conclusion, I strongly prefer that project members work in person rather than relying on email, as in-person collaboration is more efficient.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;Increasingly, university professors are engaging in scientific research. Some people express concerns that this trend may diminish the quality of education and advocate for professors to allocate more time to teaching. However, based on my experiences, I believe that professors should be encouraged to prioritize research.Firstly, engaging in research serves as a significant avenue for self-improvement for professors. Universities often create a somewhat insular environment, and research projects offer valuable opportunities for interaction beyond their campuses. Moreover, involvement in research allows professors to stay abreast of the latest advancements in modern technology. I recall that during my college years, one of my professors participated in several research initiatives and was frequently invited to give talks at other institutions. Despite my university not being among the top-ranked, he earned considerable recognition through these projects. Research endeavors act as gateways to the broader world.Secondly, professors can take full advantage of the research-friendly atmosphere that universities provide. Campuses often boast cutting-edge laboratories, and they attract a diverse pool of talented individuals. Therefore, there is little justification for discouraging professors from leveraging these resources. A well-known example is Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of general relativity while working as a professor at the University of Berlin. Universities play a crucial role in fostering the success of faculty members.Lastly, conducting research can enhance the quality of teaching. Through research initiatives, professors can guide their students from theoretical knowledge to practical applications. I remember serving as an assistant in one of my professor's research projects, where I had the chance to apply textbook theories to real-life experiments. Such projects offer a more effective teaching method.For these reasons, it is reasonable to advocate for professors to dedicate more time to research. This pursuit not only fosters their personal growth but also generates outcomes that benefit society as a whole.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;Every individual learns in their own way, choosing methods that they find most effective. Self-directed learning certainly has its advantages. It allows for complete focus on the material, free from distractions, leading to deeper understanding. However, I personally prefer learning with a teacher rather than learning independently.Firstly, one of the key benefits of learning from a teacher is the ability to ask questions about challenging topics. When we encounter difficulties that we cannot resolve on our own, reaching out to a teacher provides an immediate pathway to finding solutions. Additionally, teachers possess a wealth of knowledge and experience, which they use to help students grasp complex concepts. They often share insights that go beyond what is found in textbooks or online resources. In my classes, I frequently engage with my teachers to address any issues I encounter, and my classmates do the same, making communication an integral part of our learning process.Secondly, I believe that learning with a teacher is more efficient than studying alone. With a teacher’s guidance, we can complete our assignments more quickly and effectively than we might on our own. Teachers help steer us in the right direction and provide invaluable support, facilitating significant academic growth and enhancing our understanding of the subject matter.Lastly, while self-study has its downsides, one significant drawback is the potential for frustration. If a student encounters a complex problem and struggles to resolve it, they may feel disheartened after repeated unsuccessful attempts. Moreover, relying solely on oneself for learning can hinder the development of collaborative skills and the ability to express thoughts clearly. For these reasons, I firmly advocate that learning with a teacher is more beneficial.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;"Many individuals feel fortunate to live in an age of advanced technology. With the emergence of new innovations, daily tasks have become more convenient and accessible. For instance, we no longer need to visit the DMV to renew our driver's licenses or travel to a bank to send money. People from earlier times might regard our capabilities as magical. However, despite these conveniences, we must acknowledge that technology has also complicated our lives. There are several reasons and examples to illustrate this point. Certainly, new technologies are beneficial, but adapting to them can be challenging. With new devices constantly being released, many people often feel overwhelmed. Take my experience with the latest iPhone; while I find it impressive, I still struggle to master all its features even after using it for a few months. Initially, I attempted to read through the instructions, but I quickly abandoned that plan because it proved too time-consuming, and there was simply too much to learn. Additionally, technology is eroding language skills. Since the advent of computers and cellphones for communication, people have developed their own shorthand, relying heavily on abbreviations and incomplete sentences. This trend has intensified with the rise of social media platforms like Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook. Even more concerning is the impact on younger generations who are exposed to these linguistic shortcuts. For instance, my younger brother has difficulty spelling words correctly and uses slang that is foreign to me. Although I've tried to help him improve, he dismisses my efforts, labeling me as overly traditional.In summary, while technology has undoubtedly enhanced our convenience, it has also contributed to a more chaotic existence, as illustrated by the points mentioned above."
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";Some individuals believe that distance learning and online courses should replace traditional classroom education, while others strongly oppose this view. Personally, I firmly believe that online classes should never supplant in-person learning. Here are my reasons.Firstly, classroom education is fundamentally more effective than online learning. A classroom setting allows for interaction with classmates, which can be a significant motivator for improvement. For instance, during my first year of a Bachelor of Commerce program, I was not particularly focused on my studies. However, witnessing some of my peers achieve higher grades inspired me to elevate my own performance, ultimately leading me to secure the top rank in my final exam.Secondly, classroom learning encourages timely completion of assignments, fostering essential time management skills. Additionally, through participating in group studies, you learn valuable communication and teamwork abilities that can benefit your future career.Thirdly, instructors play a crucial role in the classroom environment. Most teachers are specialists in their fields and provide valuable insights and practical skills. Engaging with professors allows you to ask questions in real-time, which clarifies any doubts and accelerates your learning. From my own experience, when I first relied on online courses for TOEFL IBT preparation, I soon realized that I was not making the progress I hoped for. After a month, I decided to enroll in an institute, where my English skills improved significantly in just one month.While it is true that online classes do have their advantages and can serve as supplementary resources, they should never replace traditional classroom learning. In conclusion, classroom education remains the most effective method of delivering education for the reasons outlined above.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";When we refer to a student, we typically mean a young person, whether male or female, who is enrolled in school or college. In some countries, teenagers are allowed to work part-time jobs alongside their studies. However, there are those who oppose the idea of teenagers juggling work with their education. Personally, I believe that taking on a part-time job is beneficial for students for two main reasons.Firstly, part-time jobs provide students with valuable lessons before they enter the workforce full-time. Through these jobs, they can acquire skills in time management, financial management, and persuasive communication. For instance, during my high school years, I worked as a salesperson in a shop for a year. Because I had to allocate time for both work and school, I learned to manage my schedule effectively. Balancing my responsibilities to my boss alongside my homework taught me how to work quickly and efficiently. Additionally, I gained insights into money management, as I was responsible for handling the shop's accounts when my boss was absent. This experience showed me that part-time work can offer students essential skills for their futures.Another advantage of part-time work is the financial support it can provide to students' families. For example, while in high school, I worked as a home tutor, teaching math to two children in my neighborhood. This role not only helped them grasp challenging topics but also allowed me to earn money, which I used to buy my own books. As a result of this tutoring job, I was able to stop relying on my parents for pocket money. Clearly, part-time employment can assist students in contributing financially to their households.In conclusion, while some may object to the idea of students working part-time, arguing that it could distract them from their studies, my own experience in high school proved otherwise, as it did not negatively impact my academic performance. Therefore, I firmly believe that part-time jobs can be advantageous for students, helping them to prepare more effectively for their futures. Every student should consider taking on a part-time job alongside their studies.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;Our world is home to diverse cultures, each with its own unique language. Consequently, it has become increasingly important for individuals to learn at least one foreign language, as we inevitably interact with people from other countries throughout our lives. Additionally, mastering a foreign language enhances a person’s skill set. I believe that it is advantageous for individuals to learn foreign languages within their own country. The reasons supporting this viewpoint are outlined in the following paragraphs.Firstly, not everyone has the financial resources or legal means to travel abroad to learn a foreign language. In the past, finding a qualified teacher for foreign language education was a challenge. However, with the rise of globalization, it has become much easier to locate language instructors in one’s home country. For instance, the Indian subcontinent now hosts numerous language centers offering training in various languages such as French and German.Secondly, educational institutions have incorporated foreign language courses into their curricula, allowing students to select from a variety of languages. This makes it convenient for learners to study a foreign language right at home. Additionally, qualified foreign language teachers are readily available in many schools and colleges.Thirdly, advancements in technology have significantly bridged the gap for those learning foreign languages within their own country. A multitude of online foreign language courses exists, along with various forums where individuals can discuss challenges and share insights related to language learning.In conclusion, learning a foreign language in one’s own country is a preferable option. It is cost-effective and offers a wealth of opportunities to achieve proficiency in another language.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;Everyone needs a break from their busy schedules, and students are no exception—they also require vacations from their demanding academic routines. Many advocate for a long vacation system in schools, arguing that it enables students to approach the academic year with a renewed passion for learning. Conversely, others argue for multiple short breaks throughout the year, which allow students to recharge periodically. While both approaches provide relief, I believe that several short breaks can be more beneficial for students' academic engagement.Firstly, frequent vacations throughout the year can help maintain lower stress levels among students. Many educational institutions schedule these short breaks after term exams, allowing students to alleviate the pressure associated with assessments. Research from universities shows that students’ performance tends to improve when they have regular pauses from their studies and exam preparations. In several countries, colleges offer vacations after each semester, giving students a chance to relax while also preparing for the next academic term. These breaks not only provide an opportunity for enjoyment but also allow students to gather resources and materials—like books and reference guides—for their upcoming courses.Secondly, scientific studies have substantiated the positive impact of breaks on student performance. Evidence indicates that students' learning capabilities improve following refreshing vacations. For example, during my school days, we had multiple vacations after our quarterly exams. I would use this time to reflect on my recent performance and revisit challenging concepts to avoid repeating mistakes. I also engaged in recreational activities and learned new sports. Each vacation made me miss school, which reignited my enthusiasm for learning and propelled me to achieve good grades in the subsequent quarter.Vacations are essential not just for students but also for professionals and homemakers, as they offer a respite from everyday responsibilities and allow individuals to focus on themselves, relieve stress, and rejuvenate their motivation to return to their routines. Thus, I strongly advocate that schools implement several short vacations throughout the year for their students.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";"""Keep going!"" echoed in my heart, even as my legs struggled to move. During the 2014 marathon, I witnessed some runners give up while others pushed through to the very end. At various moments, my body urged me to stop, but I made the conscious choice to continue. I persevered and achieved a lifelong goal by winning a medal just shy of my thirtieth birthday. This experience reinforced my belief that one must persist in pursuit of their goals.Firstly, committing to our goals fosters a sense of personal worth. For instance, I discovered the true potential of my body and mind when I dedicated myself to intense training. Even if I hadn't won the medal, I would still have recognized the immense effort I put in just to keep my weary legs moving.Secondly, facing significant challenges makes us stronger. I remember the struggle I faced during the first round when I was the last to cross the finish line. Yet, I refused to give up; I believed that I could improve in the subsequent rounds because I knew how to better myself. I had faced defeat countless times before achieving my first victory, and each loss only made me more resilient.Lastly, as ordinary individuals, we may sometimes feel overwhelmed by the weight of our responsibilities to our goals. However, I believe this responsibility is worth the burden. When the journey is long and difficult, a runner who surpasses their limits can take great pride in their accomplishment. They will savor the sweetness of triumph for having persevered in their pursuit.For these reasons, I wholeheartedly believe that one should never give up, as true fulfillment lies in maintaining our dignity. Anyone striving to achieve their goals must recognize that their efforts and the lessons learned from hardship unveil their true potential, increase their strength, and ultimately prepare them to tackle even greater challenges in life."
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;In recent years, many developed nations have experienced low saving rates as individuals tend to spend their earnings immediately or even take out loans to cover their expenses. However, isn't it wiser to save money for future investments or emergencies? I believe that setting aside a portion of your income is crucial since the future is unpredictable, both professionally and personally, and having savings can help you achieve some of your aspirations.Firstly, there are numerous uncertainties regarding your career. The current global economic climate is challenging, with many unpredictable factors that make it essential to have a financial cushion. For instance, I know several friends who recently lost their jobs due to the economic crisis in Europe. Many of them had no savings to rely on, which made it impossible for them to pay rent, forcing them to move back in with their families and losing their independence.Moreover, personal circumstances can change unexpectedly, leading to unavoidable expenses that savings could help cover. I recall a friend from university who had minimal savings and faced a significant car repair bill. Lacking the funds, he was unable to maintain the vehicle and had to sell it.Finally, having savings enables you to indulge in luxuries and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving for future investments can provide a sense of accomplishment and allow you to reward yourself. For example, last summer, my girlfriend and I went on a month-long backpacking trip through Southeast Asia, a dream we could only realize thanks to our savings.Taking all these points into consideration, I firmly believe that saving money is not just an option—it’s a necessity.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;"In recent decades, modern technologies and globalization have significantly accelerated the pace of life. While many individuals embrace this fast lane, others choose to slow down and take their time. To fully understand this phenomenon, we must evaluate both the benefits and drawbacks of this rapid lifestyle and reflect on which approach is more beneficial. Personally, I believe that leading a slower-paced life is crucial, as a hurried existence brings with it numerous disadvantages.Firstly, living in the fast lane can lead to high levels of stress, adversely impacting health. Constantly rushing without taking breaks takes a toll on the body, often resulting in conditions like burnout. For instance, my father experienced a breakdown a few years ago due to the pressures of his demanding job. After a few weeks off, he recuperated and decided to adopt a slower lifestyle, which has allowed him to thrive since then.Moreover, a slower pace of life contributes to greater happiness. When overwhelmed by stress, it becomes difficult to nurture relationships with loved ones. By choosing not to rush, one can dedicate more time to family and friends, which fosters a supportive social environment that boosts overall happiness and lowers stress levels. A friend of mine exemplifies this; he embraces a slower lifestyle and feels fulfilled because he can cherish his family and nurture his friendships.Finally, quality often requires time. When tackling challenging tasks hastily, the likelihood of making avoidable mistakes increases. Rushing can lead to oversights and missed opportunities, ultimately resulting in errors that could have been prevented with more patience. For example, I once wrote an essay under time pressure, which resulted in a poor grade due to mistakes I could have easily avoided.In conclusion, considering the points mentioned, it is clear that living at a slower pace offers significant benefits for one's health, happiness, and the quality of work produced."
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;Over the past few centuries, the global population has steadily increased and has now surpassed seven billion for the first time in history. This growth has led to the widespread destruction of natural environments to accommodate housing, agriculture, and industry. However, it is crucial to consider the importance of preserving our land to support the other species that inhabit our planet. In my view, we must fundamentally change our approach to the environment for several reasons.Firstly, maintaining biodiversity is vital for future generations. If we do not alter our current behaviors, we risk driving numerous species, which have thrived for millions of years, to extinction. As we continue to dismantle natural habitats such as forests, jungles, and lakes for industrial and agricultural development, we are undermining the ecosystem itself. For example, vast areas of the South American rainforest are devastated daily to clear land for timber and farming. The loss of this critical ecosystem means that countless endangered animals lose their homes and face extinction, depriving future generations of the chance to see and study these remarkable species.Moreover, a healthy and sustainable environment is essential for climate stability. Our actions contribute to pollution, which significantly disrupts weather patterns on Earth and leads to the undeniable phenomenon of global warming. This, in turn, impacts not only endangered animals but also humans, as we contend with rising sea levels and changing climatic conditions. For instance, recent reports from the United Nations suggest that by 2050, the average sea level could rise by over one meter. This dramatic shift will profoundly affect coastal populations and alter global climates.In summary, the arguments presented above highlight the urgent need for us to change our behavior toward the environment. This change is crucial not only for the preservation of endangered species but also for maintaining our own quality of life.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;University students hold varying opinions regarding class attendance. Some feel it should be mandatory, while others argue it should be optional. In my view, given the level of education at university, students possess the maturity to make their own choices. Therefore, I firmly believe that attending classes should be optional.Firstly, attending classes can sometimes be a waste of time. For instance, certain lecturers at our university simply read from the reference books without providing clear explanations, leaving students confused and frustrated. Since university students are capable of reading and understanding textbooks on their own, this method often feels unproductive. Additionally, with today's technology, students can easily access a wealth of information online, from articles and e-books to video tutorials that present data in a more engaging manner. While some lecturers do deliver highly informative and engaging lectures that students find valuable, this is not the case for all.Moreover, universities often schedule lectures throughout the entire day, which can be challenging for students who also work part-time to support their education. Balancing work, study, and lecture schedules can be difficult. Instead of sitting through uninspiring lectures, students can engage in other activities, such as debate competitions, swimming meets, and basketball games, which allow them to connect with other students and build valuable relationships.In conclusion, while a few exceptional lecturers provide enriching educational experiences, many classes can be tedious and wasteful. By the time students reach university, they have matured both mentally and physically, equipping them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. Allowing class attendance to be optional would ultimately maximize their time and provide more benefits than drawbacks.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;Believe it or not, people today often grapple with the question of whether technology simplifies their lives, which can lead to confusion. Many argue that technology does indeed make life easier. While I acknowledge that technology can complicate life in certain aspects, I believe the conveniences it offers outweigh these complications. Below, I will elaborate on my perspective.First, in the realm of transportation, it is undeniable that advancements in automotive technology have simplified travel. With a personal vehicle, you can easily reach destinations in other cities while relaxing in comfort. Likewise, if you wish to travel across oceans, modern airplanes can transport you in just a few hours—something unimaginable in ancient times.Second, technology has also streamlined the teaching process. In the past, educators had to manually write lessons on chalkboards, which was time-consuming and often exhausting. With the introduction of iPads for e-learning, traditional paper books and blackboards are becoming obsolete. All necessary knowledge and information can now be stored on iPads and accessed with a simple tap, placing it right at students' fingertips.It is true that technology can complicate life to some extent. Take mobile phones, for instance. What began as a simple tool for communication has evolved into a device that demands constant attention for social media updates, such as Facebook, Twitter, and various forums, adding pressure to users. Additionally, mobile games can be highly addictive, particularly for teenagers, contributing to a growing concern over screen addiction and resulting in increased complexity and stress in their lives.In conclusion, while technology can undoubtedly complicate life in certain ways, the significant conveniences it provides far outweigh the drawbacks.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";"Some individuals argue that mass media should focus solely on news and current events, while others contend that television, newspapers, and magazines should also entertain us by covering the lives of celebrities. This topic is contentious; however, I believe that a closer look reveals that mass media excessively concentrates on trivial matters for various reasons.One significant reason is that television and newspapers often emphasize the lives of famous individuals to boost their audience or readership. Sensationalist press and tabloid television are increasingly overtaking reputable newspapers and documentary programs. With the rise of the internet, we now have access to information from around the globe, meaning that traditional media no longer have to prioritize keeping people informed; their primary objective has shifted to attracting as many viewers or readers as possible.Another factor is that we live in a culture that prioritizes appearance and gossip. Today, relentless paparazzi follow celebrities, snapping photos of them in mundane moments like dining or exercising. Newspapers frequently face criticism for engaging in ""checkbook journalism,"" where they pay substantial sums for exclusive photos or stories. Additionally, there are reality TV shows that place individuals in fabricated scenarios, such as ""Big Brother.""In conclusion, it is evident that television, magazines, and newspapers devote excessive attention to people's private lives for the aforementioned reasons—primarily to enhance audience engagement and to deliver exciting, sensational news to a society that thrives on sensationalism and tabloid culture."
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;Some individuals may choose to live in various locations over time for numerous reasons, such as seeking better job opportunities, housing, or communities. However, I prefer to reside in my hometown for the entirety of my life. In my hometown, I have many friends and strong relationships, I enjoy the traffic here, and the environment is simply beautiful.I was born and raised in this small town. I have forged friendships with many people, and we often spend our free time playing sports like soccer and basketball, always having a great time. Everyone in my town knows each other, and we maintain positive relationships. If someone is in need, their neighbor is always ready to lend a helping hand. There’s nowhere else I could find such a strong sense of community.One reason I love living here is the traffic system. We have wide streets and relatively few cars, making it easy to get around. Just last week, I went to the city center to visit friends. The traffic there was incredibly congested, and it took me an hour just to reach my friend’s house.Additionally, I cherish the environment in my hometown. I have traveled to various places and stayed in different locations, and I’ve found that many are not as clean or refreshing as my hometown. Larger crowds tend to lead to a less pristine environment.In conclusion, I firmly believe that staying in one place is preferable to moving around frequently. While relocating can offer a wealth of experiences, living in a stable environment, like my hometown, provides comfort in terms of traffic, community, and the overall environment.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;When deciding on accommodation after high school, many students find themselves torn between two options: living in an apartment or opting for university dormitories. In my opinion, both choices come with their own set of advantages and disadvantages.On one hand, residing in a dormitory allows students to immerse themselves in the university's academic atmosphere. For example, living on campus provides opportunities to participate in various extracurricular activities, such as conversation clubs and sports teams. It also facilitates increased interactions with professors and peers, which can enhance academic support. If a student encounters challenges, such as difficulty solving a math problem, they can easily seek assistance from roommates, classmates, or faculty members. Overall, I believe that living in a dormitory is beneficial for students.Conversely, living off-campus encourages students to prepare for real-world responsibilities. For instance, those who rent apartments learn crucial skills, including responsibility, independence, punctuality, and cooperation, which they might not develop as fully in university dorms. They become accountable for managing their living expenses, such as paying rent and utility bills, while also balancing academic commitments to maintain good grades. Additionally, off-campus living provides them the chance to engage with their surrounding community, fostering social skills that will be valuable post-graduation.Given these points, I understand why students often struggle to choose between these living arrangements, as both offer distinct benefits. If I had to make a choice, I would definitely prefer the second option: living in an apartment. I believe this experience would equip me with essential life skills that are crucial for leading a successful life.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;Today, organizations are on the lookout for individuals who can work exceptionally fast and meticulously. These individuals play a crucial role in enhancing a company's effectiveness. While working quickly can introduce certain risks, it is often close to the ideal mentioned earlier. I fully support this statement for several reasons. The pursuit of skill development, balancing multiple jobs in a week, and managing increased responsibilities are key factors that have influenced my perspective.Firstly, those who work efficiently are presented with greater opportunities for learning. Enrolling in courses designed to enhance employees' skills can be a highly effective strategy. When individuals understand how to improve their speed through training, they can thrive in their roles. For instance, I have a friend who struggled with his work pace and faced the threat of dismissal from his boss. After attending a course on working more efficiently, he has successfully turned his performance around.Moreover, the rising cost of living has led many to take on two or three jobs each week. Relying on a single income often falls short of meeting financial needs, compelling individuals to increase their work pace. For example, I am currently juggling two jobs to save money for studying abroad, as the expenses involved are quite significant. The more money I earn, the greater my opportunities become.Lastly, individuals who work at a slower pace often find themselves overwhelmed when it comes to managing additional tasks. Demonstrating the ability to handle more responsibilities—even if done carelessly—can lead to increased task assignments from supervisors. Completing these tasks quickly can lead to positive recognition from your boss, motivating you to work even harder. This drive can cultivate a mindset that embraces efficiency, ultimately positioning you for promotions and higher earnings.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly agree with the assertion that individuals should strive to work faster, even if it carries some risks. The benefits of acquiring new skills through education, pursuing multiple jobs, and effectively handling greater responsibilities outweigh any drawbacks. I hope more people embrace this approach, as it aligns with my own beliefs.
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;Over the past decade, the demands on university students have been continually rising. Some argue that students should not be allowed to attend classes unless they pass an exam first, while others believe that students should be free to enroll in courses regardless of exam results. In my view, students can gain valuable university knowledge without the requirement of passing exams. Here are my reasons.To begin with, students often excel in certain areas while struggling in others. For instance, I have a passion for Physics, but I find Electronics less engaging because it isn't always evident in the real world. I have received a zero on my Physics scores in Electronics, yet I consistently achieve perfect scores in other Physics subjects. If I were required to pass the Electronics exam before attending any classes, I would likely fail repeatedly and miss out on learning the other aspects of Physics. Fortunately, my university allows students to take classes regardless of exam performance, enabling me to focus on areas where I excel. Eventually, I reattempted the Electronics exam and passed it.Furthermore, if universities adopt a policy that prohibits attendance without passing exams, many students are likely to remain unproductive. Failing most exams means students cannot participate in most classes, leaving them with little to do on campus. This could lead them to spend excessive time playing video games instead of studying, ultimately harming their academic performance. Consequently, these students may find themselves struggling to succeed in the real world. This situation reflects not only a failure of the university but also a flaw in the entire education system.It is true that student performance might decline if universities allow attendance without passing tests. However, the advantages of unrestricted access to classes far outweigh concerns about lower grades.In conclusion, universities should permit students to attend classes regardless of exam results. This policy recognizes that not all students excel in every area of a subject, and it helps prevent students from becoming disengaged and unproductive on campus.
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;University education plays a crucial role in shaping one’s life, which is why it is a topic of constant discussion. What is the best way to support student development? Should we simply increase professors' salaries? I believe not. While professors are important, universities exist primarily for the benefit of students. Funds should be allocated towards enhancing campus facilities and updating resources, which ultimately serve student needs better than solely benefiting instructors. Here are my thoughts on this matter.First and foremost, schools should prioritize students over professors. The most effective way to enhance education is by encouraging students to engage actively in their learning process. By modernizing school facilities, students are more likely to spend additional time on campus completing assignments. A comfortable and appealing environment can motivate students to stay longer, thus fostering a positive cycle of learning. In essence, improved study spaces lead to better quality work, boosting healthy competition among peers. In my university, our classrooms are outdated and lack appeal, so I often find myself preferring to work in a coffee shop rather than stay on campus. Unfortunately, these coffee shops can be noisy, causing my classmates and I to rush through our assignments.Furthermore, the ultimate goal of education is to inspire and motivate students to achieve their best. Increasing professors' salaries is not the right approach to improve education. Moreover, would the university be assessing all professors fairly? Some may not be deserving of a pay increase, making such expenditures pointless. Higher salaries do not necessarily translate to better teaching or increased student engagement. In my country, there was recent news of proposed salary increases for professors, which led to student protests against the idea. This backlash highlights that, had the salary raises been beneficial, there would not have been such a strong demonstration.At the core of university life, students should be the priority. Tuition fees are meant to enhance students' educational experiences, not solely to fund higher salaries for professors. This belief is fundamentally why I oppose allocating more financial resources to instructor compensation. Ultimately, students should be the ones benefiting from their investment in education.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;Pets have always played a vital role in our society. While cats and dogs are the most popular choices, people also keep birds, tortoises, and fish. Some argue that pets should be treated like family members, while others believe they are merely animals and do not possess human-like thoughts or emotions. This debate is contentious, but I firmly believe that pets deserve to be treated as if they were human beings for several compelling reasons. Firstly, pets are companions in much the same way that friends are. They are consistently by our side and provide comfort when we feel lonely. We can share our thoughts with them, and they tend to listen more attentively than some humans. To illustrate this, I can share a personal experience. At the age of 14, I lost my uncle, and everything seemed to lose its significance. Talking to my friends was disheartening because none had experienced such loss. During the long hours I spent alone at home, my dog remained close by, and it felt as though he was the only one who truly understood my deep sorrow. Clearly, even though pets cannot speak, they provide steadfast support.Secondly, pets offer a range of practical benefits. For instance, pet therapy is becoming increasingly recognized for its positive effects on various health issues. Studies have shown that pets can aid in treating many illnesses. There are service dogs that help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings, enabling them to move independently. Additionally, pets can provide comfort to those struggling with depression, as their mere presence can uplift spirits. Furthermore, certain dogs are trained to assist law enforcement by detecting criminals or sniffing out illicit substances.In conclusion, I firmly believe that pets should be regarded as family members due to the reasons outlined above: they are our loyal friends and offer invaluable support in various aspects of life.
313;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind. Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace. I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.Primarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.Secondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. Besides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.To sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.;The world we inhabit today is quite unpredictable, where even a single, sudden invention can challenge our longstanding beliefs. Many of us have tried to keep pace with the rapid development of our modern society. I believe that while quick responses may seem wise in today’s fast-moving environment, they may not always benefit our society in the long run.Firstly, even in a fast-paced world, accuracy remains crucial. Simple tasks, like completing homework, demand precision. If we rush our work and take unnecessary risks that lead to mistakes, we compromise our learning experience, treating it as a mere exercise to meet deadlines. This approach renders our efforts practically worthless. Instead of focusing solely on completion, we should aim to enhance our capabilities. Although it may take time to catch up with others if we need to review our work thoroughly, consistent effort will eventually improve our efficiency.Secondly, beyond the need for accuracy, the world also values efficiency, which encompasses both timely completion and quality standards. If we manage to keep up the pace by overlooking important details and focusing only on the broader aspects of a project, we risk disappointing companies and clients. When issues arise, we may find ourselves reverting to fix mistakes, a process that can be more costly and time-consuming than delivering a well-completed project from the beginning.Moreover, in a broader context, some tasks cannot afford any errors. For instance, in high-stakes missions like those conducted by NASA, even a small mistake could have catastrophic consequences. A miscalculation in a rocket's orbit could jeopardize the entire mission, potentially costing trillions of dollars. In such cases, despite the urgency to complete tasks quickly, scientists must ensure that every detail is meticulously accounted for to avoid triggering a cascade of problems.In conclusion, while it’s important to keep pace with the world, we must tread carefully, as hasty or careless work is unacceptable if we wish to remain competitive.
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;The ongoing technological and economic advancements in today's world have led to significant disparities between cities, evident in their varying sizes. There are sprawling metropolises with populations exceeding 20 million alongside quaint towns with just a few hundred residents. This diversity in urban environments has allowed for a wider range of individual preferences regarding living conditions. Personally, I have a preference for larger cities over smaller ones, a stance shaped by several factors.Firstly, I am drawn to the vibrancy of big cities. Living in a dynamic setting can provide rich experiences that enhance one's character and broaden perspectives on life. Daily life in larger cities presents new challenges, whether it's choosing a restaurant or selecting a company to work for. To me, this lifestyle is incredibly appealing and stands in stark contrast to the monotonous, slower pace of small towns.Additionally, the amenities and services available in big cities significantly contribute to the well-being of their residents. Comprehensive hospitals and advanced medical facilities ensure that healthcare needs are met, while cultural offerings like exhibitions and theater performances can expand one's horizons—opportunities often lacking in smaller communities.Moreover, it's clear that a country's economic vitality is largely fueled by its major cities, where wealth and financial resources tend to be concentrated. This economic clout translates into a greater array of career opportunities and potential for higher income in larger cities, both of which can lead to a more satisfying and healthier lifestyle.In conclusion, while I favor the hustle and bustle of big cities, I recognize that this preference is ultimately subjective. I also appreciate the tranquility of the countryside and would relish the chance to spend a few days there to recharge and escape the stresses of city life.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";The housing crisis has become an increasingly pressing issue in recent years, with rising accommodation costs significantly impacting many households. It is crucial for the government to provide financial assistance to address this challenge. The priority should be to focus on new construction rather than the preservation of historical and traditional buildings.Constructing new housing is essential to fulfill people's basic needs. Without decent living conditions, individuals cannot lead fulfilling lives. As housing prices continue to escalate, comfortable homes will become unattainable luxuries for the middle and lower classes. This reality could trap ordinary people, especially the younger generation, in a cycle of working just to cover housing costs, leading to increased dissatisfaction with the government. When individuals are in constant fear of losing their homes, their productivity diminishes. Thus, it is vital for the government to invest in people to alleviate this burden, fostering a government that truly represents and serves its citizens.Moreover, investing in new construction is critical because it requires significantly more resources compared to maintaining older buildings. New projects demand available land acquired through formal governmental processes, reputable construction firms, and a substantial labor force. Additionally, numerous challenges can arise during construction, making it essential for the government to leverage its vast resources and capabilities to facilitate these efforts effectively.In conclusion, I firmly believe that new housing development warrants a greater share of government funding.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;I concur with the idea that while life can feel challenging in the moment, those tough experiences ultimately provide us with valuable lessons for the future. My viewpoint stems from the understanding that each difficult situation enhances our skills, refines our decision-making, and increases our adaptability in life.A perfect illustration of this concept is how infants learn essential survival skills during their early years. Each day presents them with new obstacles, such as walking and eating, and these challenges impart crucial lessons that benefit them throughout their lives. For instance, when babies are learning to walk, they often stumble and hurt themselves. Nevertheless, they gradually refine their technique and eventually master walking.Additionally, breakthroughs in invention and scientific discovery arise from countless setbacks. No scientist achieves success on their first attempt. For example, Thomas Edison reportedly tested around 10,000 different bulbs before successfully inventing the light bulb. Each of these initial failures was difficult and often frustrating for him, but he continued to explore alternatives and glean insights from every experiment, ultimately leading to his success.Moreover, challenging experiences can unknowingly strengthen us. When we reflect on those tough times later in life, we often feel more confident about our decisions and ourselves. For instance, when I moved to a college hostel after finishing high school, the first few days were quite unsettling as it was my first experience away from my parents and living with unfamiliar people. I felt vulnerable and emotionally unsettled at first, but over time, I began to connect with my roommates and adapt. This experience not only improved my social skills but also increased my confidence in communicating with others.In conclusion, I believe that every experience in life—whether positive or negative—offers us valuable lessons for the future. Positive experiences create treasured memories, while negative ones provide essential lessons that shape who we become.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";"Initiated in the late eighteenth century, industrialization and urbanization led to a dramatic increase in the number of automobiles. The primary fuel for these vehicles, oil, has now become a major source of pollution in urban environments. While critics decry the excessive consumption of oil and advocate for imposing additional charges on drivers during peak hours due to their perceived selfishness, I argue that such fees should not be instituted. Here are my reasons. Capitalism grants individuals the right to own property, which inherently includes the right to use that property. While driving during rush hours contributes to environmental pollution, laws exist to protect drivers’ right to operate their vehicles. Imposing extra fees on them appears to be beyond the legal scope. Additionally, traffic congestion is a natural occurrence that is beyond anyone’s control; therefore, it is unjust to penalize drivers for it. Why should drivers incur fines for merely using their own vehicles at specific times? Wars are often criticized, yet we don’t blame soldiers for fighting for their nations.The financial burden of purchasing a car amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the various fees associated with vehicle ownership can be overwhelming for many families. Adding another fee for driving is not only illogical but also absurd. Most families buy cars for safer and more convenient transportation, and imposing excessive fees only adds to their financial strain, infringing on their rights.Rather than passively imposing additional charges on drivers, governments should actively promote the use of more efficient and environmentally friendly energy sources and develop more rational transportation layouts that minimize fuel consumption. Often, traffic congestion arises from issues like malfunctioning traffic signals or poorly designed roadways. In such instances, it is the city planners—not the drivers—who should be held accountable for any fines. In essence, imposing fees on drivers without considering the root causes of traffic problems is both unreasonable and potentially unlawful.In conclusion, traffic congestion during ""rush hours"" is often not directly attributable to the actions of drivers. The true causes of such delays can stem from a variety of factors, making it both unreasonable and irrational to charge drivers additional fees."
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";In today's world, the gap between school and society continues to widen. To help students adapt to societal norms more effectively, parents should encourage them to pursue part-time jobs. Several reasons support this viewpoint.First, universities provide limited opportunities for students to understand adult life since most of their interactions are with fellow students. In contrast, part-time jobs expose students to a diverse range of individuals, primarily adults, who can impart valuable lessons about life beyond academia. For instance, my friend Lisa, who is currently working part-time, has found it to be an invaluable experience. Through her job, she has made connections with various people who have introduced her to different facets of adult life. She initially believed that work was the most crucial aspect of adulthood. However, after engaging with her coworkers, she realized that responsibility is the true essence of adult life. The insights shared by her new friends have significantly boosted her confidence regarding her future.Second, parents often warn students that adult life is much more stressful than school life. Yet, without real-world experience, it’s hard for young people to grasp just how challenging adulthood can be. Part-time jobs allow students to experience the demands of adult life firsthand. Research suggests that students who take on part-time work are more likely to use their time wisely to prepare for the future. More importantly, they tend to have more realistic expectations about life than their peers who do not work part-time.Lastly, some parents fear that part-time jobs might negatively impact their children's studies. In reality, many students work during school breaks, which does not interfere with their academic responsibilities. Indeed, taking a part-time job is a more productive way to spend time during vacations than indulging in excessive screen time.In conclusion, part-time employment provides students with valuable insights into the realities of adult life. Therefore, it is essential for parents to encourage their children to take on these roles.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";"Academic success is influenced by various factors, one of which is the working style we prefer while studying. Specifically, we might choose to work either collaboratively with other students or independently. Personally, I lean towards solitary study for several reasons.Firstly, my temperament plays a significant role in my preference for individual work over teamwork. As a natural introvert, I often find it challenging to adapt to new environments and people. For instance, during a group presentation with unfamiliar classmates, I ended up preparing over half of the work alone because I felt uncomfortable reaching out to others. Thus, I find that my productivity increases significantly when I can work in a manner that aligns with my personality.Moreover, studying alone allows me to avoid the complications inherent in teamwork. I don’t have to negotiate division of tasks, share accountability and rewards, or engage in team-building activities. These benefits are particularly valuable when time is limited. For example, about a year ago, I participated in a student brainstorming competition. Much to my competitors' surprise, I emerged victorious as the sole member of my ""team.""In summary, I believe that my temperament and the benefits of studying alone provide compelling reasons to choose independent study over collaboration."
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;Many individuals prefer to work for an employer due to the security of a stable salary and the comfort of not having to deal with issues associated with owning a business, such as tax obligations and sales concerns. However, despite these challenges, I personally would choose to pursue my own venture. Here are my reasons. First and foremost, time is the most precious resource in my life. By running my own business, I have the flexibility to manage my schedule. I can work whenever I choose and I don’t have to justify delays to a boss. This allows me to plan travel as I wish, and I can also put in extra hours to increase my earnings. Above all, the freedom that comes with being self-employed is what I value the most.Additionally, financial gain is a primary motivation for why people work. The amount of money earned is often the most crucial factor in selecting a job. When working for someone else, I tend to undervalue my ideas and end up earning less. Despite the challenges of entrepreneurship, I believe I can achieve greater financial success by leveraging my creativity and unique insights.In conclusion, even though many people may hesitate to work for themselves, I aspire to run my own business to better manage my time and potentially earn more through my original ideas.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";"It is essential for cities to update their infrastructure by replacing old buildings with new ones; however, this transition should not encompass historic structures. These historic buildings serve as a testament to our ancestors' legacies, revealing important aspects of our past. Additionally, they can enhance tourism by drawing visitors to the area.Historic buildings help answer many intriguing questions about our forebears, making it impossible to assign a definitive value to them.

They not only contribute to the economy by fostering various industries but also symbolize our cultural heritage, reflecting the rich history of our ancestors."
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;Learning is an integral part of our lives, and the quality of our education heavily relies on our teachers, alongside our ability for self-study. Many people hold the belief that no one can teach us better than our parents, and I wholeheartedly support this view for several reasons.Firstly, parents serve as our first teachers from the moment we are born. They guide us through essential early experiences, such as learning to smile and walk, as well as teaching us daily routines like eating. As we grow, they share enchanting stories and important moral lessons that shape our character for a lifetime.Secondly, although we study subjects like science and languages in school, a significant portion of our education occurs at home. We typically spend more time with our families than at school, and while we might forget some classroom lessons if we don't apply them, the teachings of our parents become embedded in our daily lives. For instance, the lesson about being grateful to those who help us is something I know I will always remember because it is a principle I practice every day.Lastly, I firmly believe that parents love their children unconditionally. Even as we grow older, marry, and start families of our own, our parents continue to support and guide us in distinguishing right from wrong. For example, my older brother, who has been married and living independently for two years, often turns to our parents for advice when he faces challenges in his career or personal life.In conclusion, I am convinced that parents are our greatest teachers.
323;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task.;"In my family, the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father's job. Five years ago, he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer, and became a landscape painter. Every time I asked him why, he will say, seriously,"" I am done, doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different, that is all."" While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job, but from my perspective, I am on the side of my father.Most of workers have adapted to do same task. It allows us to achieve more. As a authoritative dentist in my province, my mother has worked for 25 years. Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India, finally he became the father of the nation. These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time. While when it comes to ""happier"", different type of jobs can be responsible factor.Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier. Workers, who work for an ordinary company or industry, will be sick of same tasks day by day. Although they can be familiar with their job, changing of job is what serve to their happier. Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment, which, according to psychology theories, makes workers relaxed and happier. To set another example, consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work, employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits. They both will be happy because the change of job, not the same task day by day.Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges, making life colorful. Just like a song, if I did not have challenge, life would be blue. As an engineering researcher, I will surely be disappointed for failure, and exited for new challenges. New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works, it also means through dealing with it, I will obtain more knowledge and experience. As the saying of a Chinese writer, the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf, but rather there always exists new things and challenge. After all, doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden, connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life.To sum up, I admire my father's choice, while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert, like my mom, I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life.";"In my family, the recurring topic of disagreement between my father and mother centers around my father's career choice. Five years ago, he left his two-decade-long job as an architectural engineer to pursue a passion for landscape painting. Whenever I ask him about his decision, he responds earnestly, “I’ve spent 20 years doing the same thing, and I just want to explore something different.” While many may find this change absurd and argue that staying in the same profession is what defines a job, I find myself siding with my father.Many workers have grown accustomed to performing the same tasks repeatedly, which often leads to greater productivity. My mother, for instance, has been a respected dentist in our province for 25 years. Historical figures like Gandhi dedicated their entire lives to fighting against British colonialism and advocating for civil rights in India, ultimately earning the title of ""Father of the Nation."" These examples highlight that significant achievements often require long-term dedication to a single endeavor. However, when it comes to happiness, diversifying job roles can play a crucial part.Engaging in a variety of tasks can lead to greater job satisfaction for both employees and employers. Workers in conventional industries may become disenchanted with the monotony of their daily routines. Although familiarity with a job can provide comfort, the opportunity for job change often contributes to happiness. Taking on different roles can rejuvenate workers, tapping into their potential to adjust to new environments. This shift, supported by psychological principles, can foster relaxation and joy. Moreover, when employees possess the ability to perform diverse tasks, employers reap the benefits, fueling happiness for both parties involved.A variety of tasks throughout the workday introduces new challenges, adding vibrancy to life. Like a song, without challenges, life feels monotonous. As an engineering researcher, I certainly experience disappointment in failure but also excitement at the prospect of new challenges. These challenges, arising from different tasks, surpass mere workload; they provide opportunities for acquiring knowledge and experience. As a Chinese writer stated, the richness of life doesn’t come solely from Japanese cherry blossoms or Canadian maple leaves, but from the existence of new experiences and challenges. Ultimately, engaging in the same routine day in and day out only serves to heighten our psychological burdens, whereas interactions with varied job roles can add depth and color to our lives.In conclusion, while I respect my father's decision to seek variety, and acknowledge that doing the same task fosters expertise—as my mother exemplifies—I firmly believe that embracing a range of tasks brings more vibrancy and fulfillment to our lives"
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;With the rapid advancement of the economy, the debate surrounding the qualities of a good employee remains at the forefront. Many argue that the ability to adapt to new environments is essential, as it serves as a fundamental communication skill for newcomers. However, from my perspective, the most crucial attribute for any worker is possessing in-depth knowledge of their job. This is why I believe that having exemplary job-specific knowledge is of paramount importance.While it's true that adaptability is a valuable trait in the workplace, facilitating effective communication and cooperation among colleagues, the long-term nature of work often relies much more heavily on an employee's expertise. Adapting to a new environment may be necessary for newcomers, but possessing comprehensive knowledge of one's role provides lasting benefits well beyond initial employment.Organizations thrive on the contributions of employees who possess strong expertise. In an IT company, for instance, groundbreaking technologies are typically developed by individuals with exceptional technical knowledge rather than merely those with excellent interpersonal skills. Moreover, a company's reputation and popularity are often bolstered by talented workers in the public relations department who excel at promoting the organization. Consequently, companies stand to gain a significant advantage and profitability from employees with substantial expertise. Employees are also rewarded for their dedication to acquiring in-depth knowledge. Throughout both undergraduate and graduate education, we learn with the intention of applying that knowledge in our careers. As an old Chinese scholar once stated, the essence of education lies in its application. Once we enter the workforce, our goal in continually building our knowledge base is not solely to ingratiate ourselves with management through adaptability, but to excel in our roles and achieve mastery. Ultimately, such expertise leads to a sense of pride and accomplishment. This is why we can take great pride in our significant knowledge.In conclusion, while adaptability is indeed a useful quality in navigating new environments, exceptional knowledge of one's job is far more critical. Not only does it benefit employers, but it also rewards employees with greater fulfillment and achievement.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;Computers have transformed our lives over the past century. While they offer numerous benefits, excessive use—particularly among young people—can lead to increased stress. Despite this, I believe that computers play a crucial and unavoidable role in the economy, business, and various other aspects of society. Additionally, they simplify daily tasks by automating routine activities.It is true that the rise of computers in many industries has diminished the role of human workers. Today, machines can oversee and execute numerous tasks that were once performed by people. Many sectors utilize computers to control robots that handle common operations previously done by humans. For instance, in the automotive industry, a significant portion of car production is now managed by robots programmed through computers. Furthermore, car manufacturers rely on computers to simulate and analyze potential accident scenarios.However, the advancement of computers has also led to job loss, with many workers being laid off as industries adopt new technologies. In terms of social and personal life, computers play a significant role by creating a network through which people can connect. This technology facilitates quick and easy communication, allowing individuals to share personal messages effortlessly. Many teenagers spend their leisure time in front of screens. Furthermore, computers enable users to access vital information with ease. On the flip side, excessive use of computers can result in various challenges. Research indicates that teenagers who become addicted to computer games may exhibit more violent and stressed behaviors. Additionally, individuals who spend long hours typing may develop knee-related health issues.Taking all factors into account, the advantages of computers far outweigh their disadvantages. Overall, people gain more from the integration of computers into their lives, as they are capable of performing complex tasks that ultimately make life easier.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;Learning a foreign language is essential for children as it enhances their overall learning abilities. The question of whether children should begin learning a second language when they start school can be a contentious one. However, I believe that starting early is beneficial. Not only does it boost their cognitive skills and memory, but it also broadens their understanding of other cultures.First, children's capacity to learn during their early years is superior to that of any later stage in life. Consequently, students are better equipped to grasp the nuances of a foreign language right from the start of their education. They can readily comprehend language structures and retain vocabulary. It is evident that children are more likely to absorb knowledge during this formative period than in adulthood. Given that young learners bear fewer responsibilities and face fewer challenges compared to older individuals, it's clear that this is an optimal time to acquire any language.Additionally, learning a foreign language greatly enhances students' understanding of the world around them. It enables them to appreciate different cultures and customs. Furthermore, it empowers them to communicate effectively with peers in diverse regions globally. Acquiring knowledge about other countries and their languages expands a child's worldview, fostering personal growth and self-reliance.In conclusion, the distinction between a bilingual child and one who speaks only their native language is evident when assessing their communication skills and understanding of different subjects. This underscores the importance of beginning foreign language education at the start of a child's academic journey.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;Men and women often rely on one another throughout life, starting from school. While some experts argue that coeducational schools can hinder educational effectiveness, others believe they provide valuable opportunities for students to understand and interact with the opposite gender. I believe that boys and girls should learn together, as it allows them to get to know one another and develop appropriate behaviors towards each other.School acts as a microcosm of society, preparing students for future interactions. By being in the same classrooms, students can learn to see members of the opposite sex as friends and classmates. This environment helps boys understand how to communicate with girls, whether it's for collaborative projects or simply social interactions. When they learn together and assist one another, they are better equipped for real-life situations as they grow older. However, some experts caution that coeducation can lead to distractions, potentially shifting students' focus away from their studies due to romantic interests and relationships.On the other hand, having both boys and girls in school could enhance motivation to perform well academically. Students often strive to showcase their abilities in front of their peers of the opposite sex, which can lead to increased effort and participation. Boys may feel compelled to demonstrate strength in front of girls and vice versa, resulting in a more productive classroom atmosphere.In conclusion, coeducational schools offer numerous benefits. Collaborative study groups can boost students' motivation, and interactions with the opposite gender can help them prepare for adult life, where they will frequently live and work alongside one another.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";"""The greatest risk is avoiding all risks."" Those who aspire to achieve their big dreams must summon their courage and embrace new experiences. While there’s no guarantee of success even with careful planning, it’s often more disheartening to see a well-thought-out plan fail than to embrace the uncertainty that comes with taking risks. Therefore, it’s crucial to seize opportunities and trust that things will work out.Embracing new possibilities is essential for gaining a wealth of experiences. Life can be challenging, especially when navigating risks, but it can also turn out to be remarkably rewarding. For example, some individuals leave their jobs, families, and friends to start anew in a foreign country, uncertain of what the future holds. Initially, they may struggle to adapt and find opportunities, but by persevering through obstacles, they can achieve their goals and begin to forge a new life.Many people hesitate to take risks out of fear of failure. Frustration is a natural part of the journey, but it’s crucial to persist in pursuing your dreams. A prime example is Walt Disney, who faced numerous challenges in his career, including the rejection of his early stories, like Mickey Mouse and The Three Little Pigs. After hearing countless ""no's,"" and even being dismissed by an editor who claimed he lacked imagination, he never wavered in his pursuit of his dreams.In conclusion, navigating this competitive world requires fearlessness and a willingness to face new challenges. Although it can be tempting to remain in the comfort of your routine, it’s essential to find the courage to take risks, embrace your uniqueness, and chase your dreams for a fulfilled life."
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";"Sometimes, people need to engage in activities that they do not find enjoyable. This is a fundamental aspect of life. Whether these activities are small or large, individuals must accept them, as many of them are tied to responsibilities. Additionally, participating in these tasks can provide valuable life lessons. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why I believe people should occasionally do things they do not enjoy.Firstly, many people’s lives are filled with tasks they would rather avoid. In our personal lives, we often have responsibilities to others that can be unpleasant. For instance, I find housework quite challenging; even though my husband helps me with some tasks, it ultimately falls on me to handle them. Despite my distaste for chores, they are my responsibility, and I must complete them.Secondly, professional life is often comprised of necessary tasks that may not be enjoyable. No one relishes attending tedious meetings or working alongside colleagues who do not fit well with the team. As a research assistant at a university, I encounter this reality; we have a professor who struggles with interpersonal relationships. Many assistants find it uncomfortable to approach him for guidance, yet we have no choice but to seek his expertise.Lastly, engaging in activities that one does not initially enjoy can lead to unexpected enjoyment. Sometimes, individuals may find themselves participating in events pushed by friends, even if they are reluctant at first. For example, my husband and I were encouraged by friends to try a dance class that we were both hesitant about. After some encouragement, we attended and ended up having a great time, continuing with the class for six months, while many of our friends dropped out after a month.Life is not always filled with enjoyable experiences; it inevitably includes tasks that are dull or unpleasant. However, many of these moments stem from our responsibilities, which are an integral part of our lives."
330;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homesÊ;The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance. Therefore, government should spend money on preservation of old buildings.;The city of my birth once boasted remarkable antique beauty, characterized by numerous buildings in classic styles. Sadly, the relentless tide of urbanization has relegated much of this grandeur to photographs and museum exhibits. To avert the loss of our historic structures, some citizens advocate for government funding aimed at their preservation. In my view, we must all take action to protect these architectural treasures for future generations to appreciate. Here are several reasons and examples that support my perspective.Historic buildings hold intrinsic value as significant symbols of a city. They serve as reminders of a locality's cultural heritage and complexity. Experiencing these structures—whether connected to notable events or simply evocative—allows people to connect with an area's aesthetic and cultural history. For instance, when someone mentions Beijing, the iconic Forbidden City likely comes to mind, as it stands as a symbol of the city and, indeed, of China's vast history. Through the study of the Forbidden City, researchers gain valuable insights into both the history and culture of the region.Moreover, historic buildings enrich our lives and offer spaces for relaxation and reflection. In cities dominated by modern high-rises and contemporary homes, finding places to unwind can be a challenge. The warmth of materials like heart pine, marble, and aged brick in old buildings evokes a sense of inner peace. Being inside a historic structure—whether lying beneath its roof or sitting at a timeworn desk—provides a welcome respite from life's everyday stresses.Additionally, historic buildings can be financially self-sustaining. Many sites, such as the Forbidden City and the Shanghai Art Museum, attract thousands of visitors each year, generating substantial revenue. Local governments benefit from this economic model, and other cities could adopt similar strategies to support their historic sites.In conclusion, the city I cherish most thrives on the blend of history and modernity. However, preserving old buildings is a critical endeavor, as there is no opportunity to revive a historic site once it is lost. This reality underscores the urgent need to identify and safeguard significant historic buildings. For this reason, I believe that government investment in their preservation is essential.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;As young people reach adulthood, they often seek greater independence and wish to live on their own. However, the question of when the right time is for young adults to leave their parents and establish their own households is a widely debated topic. I believe that young adults should remain living with their parents for a longer duration.Living independently entails a significant financial responsibility. Younger individuals typically have limited access to high-paying jobs, making it challenging to cover expenses such as rent, food, utilities, and other essential costs. Therefore, staying with parents can be a practical choice until young adults gain a foothold in their careers and have a stable income.In addition to financial considerations, living with parents fosters a stronger emotional bond. Parents can offer valuable guidance as their children navigate the complexities of adulthood. Residing together creates an environment conducive to open discussions about the psychological and emotional changes young adults encounter. Those who move out may find it difficult to broach these topics with their parents and, consequently, miss out on their insightful perspectives.While some critics argue that living with parents restricts young adults' freedom, I contend that many young adults will actually benefit from the structure that comes with this arrangement. If living at home prevents them from engaging in risky behaviors like excessive partying, drug use, or other unhealthy habits, that is a positive outcome.In conclusion, I believe young adults should only consider moving out once they are confident in their ability to live independently. Sacrificing the opportunity to live with parents for the sake of late-night outings or substance use is unwise. By remaining at home, young adults can better manage their emotional and psychological development, ease financial burdens, and stay focused on their goals. Thus, it is crucial for young adults to extend their time living with their parents.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;Today, the Earth feels akin to a small village. Over the past century, technology has dramatically transformed how the majority of people communicate. However, there is considerable debate about whether this change is beneficial or detrimental. In my view, this evolution has been overwhelmingly positive, despite some of its downsides.Firstly, staying connected with distant loved ones has never been easier. Technology has revolutionized communication to the point where face-to-face interactions are often unnecessary. Tools like Skype, MSN, and WhatsApp allow us to reach out to anyone at any time. For instance, in the past, many were reluctant to travel far due to the risk of getting lost. This change illustrates how technology has made significant positive contributions.Moreover, communication tools have simplified the process of making new friends. Statistics show that 40% of people have met their life partners online. In this way, the Internet serves as an essential platform for both maintaining old friendships and forging new ones.On the flip side, relying on the Internet or phones for communication can hinder our ability to fully convey our thoughts and emotions. Misinterpretations can easily arise during these conversations, contributing to an increase in divorce rates.In conclusion, I reaffirm my belief that technological advancements have positively influenced communication by making it more accessible and convenient.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The debate regarding whether the use of machines provides significant advantages to society is a pressing concern for many individuals. In my view, while machines offer numerous benefits, we must also acknowledge their negative consequences.There is no doubt that machines bring various advantages. First and foremost, machines are generally more efficient than humans. Unlike people, machines do not require breaks, allowing them to work continuously and consistently produce high-quality products without errors. Additionally, the use of machines can reduce costs for companies. Since machines do not demand salaries, overtime pay, or pensions, employers can avoid expenses related to employee welfare. Instead, they only need a few technicians to ensure that the machines operate correctly or to replace any faulty parts.However, we should not overlook the disadvantages that come with increased reliance on machines. Firstly, widespread use of machines often leads to job loss for many individuals. This is particularly concerning in densely populated countries, where high unemployment rates can contribute to crime and social unrest. Furthermore, machinery can cause significant pollution and waste energy. For instance, many people now opt for dishwashers instead of washing dishes by hand, unaware that dishwashers can consume at least twice the amount of water and electricity needed for manual washing. If thousands of households use dishwashers, the cumulative waste of water and energy can be substantial.In conclusion, although we cannot deny that machines play a crucial role in our daily lives and work environments, the issues they create deserve our attention as well.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;Over the years, scientists have consistently unveiled remarkable advancements in information technology, such as interactive whiteboards, multicore computers, laptops, tablets with stunning resolutions, and smartphones that rival traditional computers in power. While the World Wide Web and email communication represent significant benefits of IT, there are also notable drawbacks to consider.To begin with, email allows for quick and easy communication between individuals. Additionally, the World Wide Web provides rapid access to a wealth of information, often in under ten seconds. These advantages highlight how beneficial information technology can be.Moreover, technology is swiftly becoming integrated into society, with scientists developing robots to assist in various tasks, as well as innovative appliances like coffee machines and engines with built-in computers. For instance, centuries ago, washing machines were nonexistent, forcing people to wash clothes by hand while attending to other tasks.However, there are potential downsides to these advancements. Experts warn that humans may one day struggle to maintain control over the very technologies they've created, particularly when it comes to robots. There are concerns that these inventions could seek to dominate our world.In summary, while IT innovations bring numerous benefits, I believe they may also pose greater challenges. It is essential for individuals to learn how to use these advancements responsibly.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;"Today, celebrities have become a focal point in mass media, with nearly half of all news coverage on television and the internet dedicated to celebrity gossip. Unsurprisingly, many individuals express concern over the implications of this obsession with the famous, particularly regarding its effects on children. This essay will examine both the negative and positive consequences of this phenomenon on young children.Fame carries significant responsibility for public figures, as their fans are often highly responsive to their actions. Celebrity scandals and gossip can circulate rapidly, and the public tends to react negatively to these issues. Consequently, celebrities who engage in substance abuse or other questionable behavior often face public disgrace. This creates a message for children that such conduct is unacceptable.Conversely, the excessive focus on celebrities may negatively impact children’s career aspirations. Recent surveys indicate that, influenced by the allure of fame and fortune, children are increasingly interested in pursuing careers as actors or athletes compared to previous generations. The proliferation of schools aimed at training aspiring stars and countless advertisements featuring famous individuals may give a misleading impression that these professions are in high demand and easily attainable. This can confuse children, who should base their career choices on personal passions rather than the influence of mass media.In conclusion, parents need to be more mindful of their children's perspectives on the ""cult of celebrity."" They should guide their children in distinguishing between superficial fame and genuine talent, while also helping them establish appropriate priorities in life."
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";"Recently, there has been growing concern about the impact of mobile phones on our social interactions. While these devices are widely used across all age groups, providing convenience and entertainment, I firmly believe that their invention has led to numerous social issues.First and foremost, excessive phone use can negatively affect social life. As individuals increasingly rely on their devices, they may lose interest in engaging in daily activities, such as meeting friends, leading to distractions during both work and social events. Additionally, prolonged mobile phone usage can harm children's eyesight and physical posture.Moreover, the plethora of games available on mobile phones, many of which are aggressive in nature—such as ""Iron Man""—can exacerbate these issues. These games often reward violent behavior, which can perpetuate aggressive feelings, thoughts, and actions among children. For example, players frequently engage in scenarios where their characters kill or shoot, potentially leading to a rise in aggressive conduct and hindering effective communication.Conversely, some people view this issue from a different perspective. The rapid advancement of the internet has facilitated instant electronic communication, allowing users to connect quickly via various apps like WeChat. This shift has made it easier for individuals to exchange messages without the need for face-to-face interaction, effectively bridging communication gaps.In conclusion, while mobile phones offer significant conveniences in communication, they also contribute to various social problems."
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;The evolution of modern communication tools has undeniably improved the way people interact, allowing for seamless connections through platforms such as email and messaging—without any time constraints. I completely agree that these technological advancements have significantly reduced the time people spend meeting their loved ones. However, there are also some drawbacks to their social lives.In contemporary society, many people rely heavily on electronic communication to foster or maintain their friendships. It is evident that there are also other platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, that facilitate meeting up with friends, making communication easy and available at any time.On the other hand, the excessive use of these digital tools has led some individuals to become increasingly unsociable. They may find themselves absorbed in the virtual world, resulting in less face-to-face interaction with others. This trend can lead to a more solitary lifestyle, as some people become overly reliant on email and messaging instead of engaging in direct conversations. Nevertheless, many individuals still prioritize maintaining strong relationships by meeting friends in person and having meaningful discussions.In conclusion, while I firmly believe that the benefits of email and messaging have streamlined our communication efforts, it is essential to prioritize real-life gatherings with friends and colleagues.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";It is clear that children possess an innocent mindset, and they require appropriate guidance at certain stages to help them grasp the value of life. Some believe it is more beneficial to encourage competition among children, while others advocate for fostering cooperation. Both perspectives have their merits, which will be explored in detail below.Competitive children tend to develop greater confidence and the ability to handle situations independently. This competitiveness often emerges in school, where educators motivate students to excel through grading systems, driving them to strive for top marks. While this approach can lead to future success, it may also present challenges. For instance, many multinational corporations prioritize teamwork, and competitive individuals may struggle to collaborate effectively within a group.On the other hand, parents who focus on instilling a sense of cooperation in their children aim to cultivate their overall sensibility for future challenges. Though these cooperative children may not possess the same urgency to achieve individual accolades as their competitive peers, they often excel in navigating various life situations through teamwork.In my view, while competitive children may demonstrate greater cleverness and speed initially, this may not secure long-term success. Conversely, cooperative children have the potential to develop and implement innovative ideas effectively within a team setting.In conclusion, I believe that fostering a spirit of cooperation in children will help them achieve a greater sense of fulfillment in life.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;"In today's world, a wide range of communication systems is prevalent. While technological advancements can have negative impacts in certain areas, I firmly believe that technology has significantly enhanced relationships among people. One of the primary benefits of technology is its ability to keep individuals closely connected. The public increasingly relies on the internet and smartphones to share information instantly, regardless of location. Unlike the days of letter writing, modern technology not only saves us time but also offers convenience and efficiency. Moreover, family members separated by distance can easily connect through the internet, particularly through images and videos, which help them feel closer to one another. This is especially important for students living in remote areas, who can share valuable experiences and resources with friends online. Additionally, in our rapidly evolving technological landscape, people have greater opportunities to develop social networks. In the past, individuals might have had pen pals in foreign countries; now, social networking websites make it easy for people to connect with others who share similar interests. People can also reconnect with long-lost friends using the internet. In this way, technology fosters the development of positive relationships among individuals. In conclusion, I believe that technology has a largely positive impact on interpersonal interactions, as it helps people forge new friendships and maintain existing ones."
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;The advancement of technology raises a significant debate about the necessity of preserving traditional skills and lifestyles, a topic of increasing public concern given technology's profound influence on our lives. In my view, the preservation of traditions is essential and deserves our attention.Traditional skills and lifestyles play a vital role in contemporary society, especially in areas such as healthcare, environmental conservation, and cultural heritage. While technology undoubtedly offers convenience, it also encourages unhealthy habits, such as a sedentary lifestyle. In contrast, traditional ways of living complement modern life and emphasize the importance of maintaining a work-life balance. Additionally, since traditional skills often rely less on fossil fuels, they present a more environmentally sustainable option, which is critical in mitigating the effects of climate change. Furthermore, these traditional practices embody cultural values and heritage, forming the cornerstone of modern civilization. By protecting traditions, we create opportunities to better understand ancient cultures and apply their wisdom to contemporary challenges.Some may argue that the protection of traditions imposes a significant financial burden that outweighs its benefits. While it is true that this sector may contribute minimally to government revenue, the costs associated with preserving traditions are insignificant compared to their potential value. Therefore, it is crucial for government authorities and educational institutions to collaborate in promoting traditional skills and lifestyles, helping people recognize their intrinsic worth.In conclusion, safeguarding traditions is not only vital for the present society but also paves the way for future generations.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;"The current educational system offers a range of academic and athletic competitions for children, aimed at fostering their desire to learn and excel while also teaching valuable teamwork skills. However, there is debate over whether it is more beneficial for children to be competitive rather than cooperative; both perspectives have valid points.A strong sense of competition can drive children to strive for excellence, often motivated by the expectations set by schools and parents to achieve high grades. While a competitive nature can lead to greater motivation and independence in overcoming challenges, it also carries the risk of hindering collaboration with others. For instance, a child who is overly focused on winning may struggle to work effectively in team projects.Conversely, cooperation is a vital skill for children to develop, both in school settings and within their communities. A collaborative spirit enhances communication and relationships with peers, increasing the chances of solving problems and reaching shared goals. Ultimately, very few individuals achieve significant success without the support of others. For example, even immensely talented singers and actors rely on teams to manage their careers and projects.In my view, while competitive children may exhibit greater motivation and ambition, this mindset may not serve them well in a societal context that values teamwork skills. In conclusion, I believe that schools and adults should prioritize fostering a spirit of cooperation in children to help them become valuable contributors to society and their communities."
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;In today’s world, advertising plays a pivotal role in helping consumers easily find and purchase top-quality products, complete with detailed information and instructions tailored to their needs. While some argue that the drawbacks of advertising outweigh its benefits, I contend that advertising generally offers more advantages than disadvantages in our lives.On one hand, many advertisements tend to exaggerate the qualities of their products, often downplaying or ignoring the potential drawbacks. This can lead to confusion among consumers, making it difficult for them to choose the most suitable items. For example, shampoos like Sunsilk, Clear, and Dove are marketed as miraculous solutions for damaged hair, promoting a multitude of benefits. However, the reality is that not all customers are satisfied with the products they purchase based on these advertisements.On the other hand, it is undeniable that the advertising industry creates numerous job opportunities, benefiting everyone from producers and writers to models and cameramen, provided their skills align with the industry’s needs. Additionally, advertising helps consumers become familiar with various companies and understand the products they offer. For instance, Coca-Cola is a prime example of a brand that invests heavily in advertising, which has contributed to its recognition and popularity worldwide. Furthermore, online advertising has emerged as one of the most effective strategies due to its affordability, convenience, and ease of tracking results.In conclusion, like everything else, advertising comes with its own set of pros and cons. However, I believe advertising would be even more effective if producers and advertisers adopted a more honest approach, providing consumers with a clearer and more accurate view of their products.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";"The disparities in earnings among different professions can often seem unjust. In the realm of art, modern artists may command substantial salaries for their creations, while laborers toil for years, only to earn a similar amount. While some argue that the government should address this imbalance, I contend that this is not a responsibility the government should take on.The proficiency of an artist greatly influences the perceived value of their work. Modern artists who translate their imaginative concepts into high-value creations are often compensated generously by art collectors. This high remuneration is tied more to the quality and rarity of their talent than to the volume of their work. For instance, a handcrafted, 15-centimeter Buddha statue may be valued significantly more than mass-produced versions. Furthermore, modern artists dedicate themselves to developing unique concepts that often seem unattainable to the average person. Take Pieter Padang, the creator of Minions, who cleverly altered a lyric from ""I swear"" to ""underwear"" in the iconic song featured in Despicable Me, earning a handsome sum for his inventive idea.In stark contrast, laborers in manufacturing plants might earn only a fraction of what these artists make, even if they produce hundreds of 15-centimeter Buddha statues daily. Similarly, a musician who repeatedly plays the song ""I swear"" may earn considerably less than Padang, as the musician is simply performing an existing piece rather than creating something new. Moreover, the government cannot standardize the value of artistic creation since art is inherently subjective and based on individual taste.Ultimately, the considerable earnings of modern artists reflect their unique struggles and achievements in the art world, a concept of ""struggle"" that may differ markedly from other professions. Therefore, I believe that it would be inappropriate for the government to intervene in an effort to equalize salaries between modern artists and workers in other fields, as the value of art is determined by personal preference."
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";"The trend of working longer hours has become increasingly common in recent times. In my native village, there's a saying: ""Health is Wealth."" Unfortunately, many people, myself included, often overlook the significance of maintaining our health. The push for longer work hours may stem from a heightened competitive atmosphere and a strong desire for financial success and promotions. However, those who work excessive hours frequently experience negative effects on both their health and personal lives. I believe that establishing a balance between personal and professional commitments is crucial, and this can be achieved by limiting the maximum number of working hours.Firstly, it is widely accepted that individuals who opt for longer work hours often neglect their health. Prolonged working hours can lead to fatigue, laziness, and a lack of motivation to engage in physical exercise, ultimately resulting in a decline in health and increased susceptibility to illness. Additionally, these individuals can become overly consumed by their jobs, descending into workaholism. The consequences of this obsession are dire, as their families and friends are deprived of their attention, leading to a significant imbalance in their personal and family lives.Furthermore, workaholics rarely find the time to contribute to society or participate in social initiatives. Their busy work schedules leave little room for leisure or community involvement. Take my boss, for example. He has spent numerous years working long hours, and recently he experienced a drastic downturn in both his health and personal life, culminating in a separation from his wife and a chaotic family situation. He now expresses regret and is attempting to regain control over his work-life balance, but unfortunately, it may be too late for him.In conclusion, I strongly advocate for the government to implement a maximum working hours clause in its Labor Laws and enforce this regulation across all companies. This measure would not only support societal well-being but also restore the critical balance between personal and professional lives for individuals."
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;"In today’s society, a common definition of a successful person is someone who has accumulated a significant amount of wealth. However, success is subjective and varies from one individual to another. For me, a truly successful person is one who has achieved meaningful milestones in life, rather than simply possessing a high income.While money is undeniably important, there are many different avenues through which it can be obtained. A person's substantial wealth does not necessarily indicate that they have earned it ethically or through their own efforts. True success comes from hard work, dedication, and passion. Whether the achievement is personal or social, such individuals deserve recognition.Furthermore, the societal impact of a person's achievements enhances their perception of success. Take Thomas Edison, for example; he is widely regarded as one of the greatest inventors of the 20th century due to the countless ways his inventions have benefited humanity. In contrast, a person's financial activities and how they utilize their wealth often remain obscured. Thus, it can be challenging to assess someone's success based solely on their income.In conclusion, measuring a person's success solely by their financial status is inadequate, even though money is essential for meeting basic needs. It is common for society to regard individuals as successful when their achievements, founded on passion, dedication, and integrity, contribute positively to the community and go beyond personal gain."
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;In today's world, people's consumption choices are significantly influenced by advertising across various platforms such as television, billboards, magazines, and more. It's certainly true that advertisements can persuade individuals to purchase items they don't actually need. For instance, in many Asian countries, advertising agencies often enlist popular singers or actors to promote products, thereby driving sales. Some consumers, particularly adolescents, may buy these items simply to support their favorite celebrities rather than out of necessity.Moreover, advertisements often portray products as more appealing and higher quality than they may truly be, leading consumers to make impulsive purchases without thinking them through. A compelling advertisement can create a perception that a product fulfills a genuine desire, even when it may not align with societal needs. This can set off a trend, where others feel compelled to buy similar products, often without any real necessity.Nonetheless, purchasing habits are inherently personal, and advertising is not the sole factor influencing consumer decisions. Individual needs and financial circumstances play significant roles as well. Adults, who are typically more conscious of managing their disposable income, are less likely to make impulsive purchases. They often have to budget their money for essential expenses. Conversely, children and adolescents, who lack economic independence, may be more prone to spontaneous buying, as they do not face the same financial pressures and might struggle to discern their actual needs.In my view, while purchasing habits are influenced by advertising, they are ultimately personal choices. However, due to their developing mental faculties, children and adolescents may find it challenging to resist the sway of advertising. Therefore, it is essential for governments to implement regulations on advertising practices—particularly those targeting children, such as toy companies—to prevent young consumers from developing distorted perceptions of their needs.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;Paying taxes is a duty that citizens across nearly every nation are required to fulfill. Some individuals believe that by fulfilling this obligation, they have contributed sufficiently to their country. I, however, do not share this perspective.Firstly, it is essential for all able citizens to pay taxes to the government, as tax revenue is the primary funding source for government operations, which ultimately serves the entire populace. For instance, a substantial portion of tax income is allocated to national defense and maintaining social stability, ensuring that everyone can live and work in a peaceful environment. Taxes also fund the salaries of public service workers, such as teachers and police officers. While these roles may not generate profit directly, their contributions are vital for the well-being of society as a whole.That said, I argue that citizens have additional important responsibilities beyond just paying taxes. Every society includes vulnerable groups, such as the impoverished and disabled, who require assistance and support. Although the government provides some funding to alleviate their struggles, this financial aid often falls short. In such instances, support from more capable or affluent citizens becomes particularly valuable, serving as a crucial supplement to government assistance. Moreover, another responsibility of citizens is to collaborate with law enforcement in maintaining social stability. With limited police resources, it is vital for local residents to take proactive measures to ensure community safety, such as reporting suspicious activities to the authorities.In summary, while paying taxes is indeed a significant responsibility of citizens, they also have other essential duties to uphold in order to contribute to a well-functioning society.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";"People hold a variety of opinions on which subjects should be included in school curricula. While I recognize the necessity for students to study multiple disciplines, I strongly oppose the idea of removing seemingly less important subjects like music and physical education from the curriculum.Many believe that students should focus solely on academic subjects such as mathematics and physics, as these are deemed essential for their future success. This perspective is understandable given the intense competition in today’s job market, where students must fulfill specific qualifications to secure employment. Additionally, high unemployment rates prompt parents to encourage their children to pursue subjects that may lead to better job opportunities.However, despite these valid concerns, I argue that there are aspects of education that extend beyond mere job acquisition. First, subjects like music, art, and sports are crucial for students' overall development. They provide avenues for self-discovery and enable young individuals to explore their potential while engaging with the world around them. Secondly, succeeding in the workforce requires more than just technical skills; it also demands soft skills such as teamwork and effective communication. Participation in sports, for example, helps students grasp the importance of collaboration and teaches essential lessons about working together. Thus, these subjects significantly contribute to enhancing students' abilities.In conclusion, while academic subjects are undeniably important in shaping children’s futures, I believe that the impact of studying music and sports is equally profound and should not be overlooked."
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;Digital media has gained immense popularity worldwide, leading to significant challenges for traditional newspapers and magazines in justifying their relevance. While some believe that print media is on the verge of extinction due to the rise of online platforms, others maintain that it will continue to persist. I align with the perspective that newspapers and magazines will eventually become obsolete. In this essay, I will support my viewpoint by examining the speed at which the internet disseminates information about current events and its ease of access to historical news.One of the media's crucial responsibilities is to deliver information about current affairs swiftly, especially during crises. This timely dissemination allows readers to stay informed and respond appropriately. For instance, when flight MH 370 disappeared, there was an overwhelming demand for updates on the tragic incident. Friends and family of the passengers and crew were desperate for answers. In such circumstances, newspapers and magazines cannot match the speed of digital media. Instead of waiting for the next print issue, individuals can access reliable information online within a matter of hours. This demonstrates why digital media is poised to dominate over print formats.Additionally, people often seek access to historical news for various reasons, including research and personal interest. For example, a researcher might want to study the impact of World War II on a small village in Japan called Oramaki. Obtaining such information from print media can be challenging, as one needs to know where to look in advance. In contrast, the internet offers efficient search capabilities, allowing users to easily find relevant details. This functionality is something that newspapers and magazines cannot provide.In conclusion, the rapid responsiveness and extensive information available through digital media will ultimately replace newspapers and magazines as primary sources of news. While the current infrastructure and societal attitudes may support the continued existence of print media for a few more years, its long-term future seems increasingly uncertain.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;In many cultures, the selection of a job often hinges on the salary offered. While I acknowledge that salary is a crucial factor, I believe there are other equally important considerations to take into account.Firstly, I recognize that money is necessary for individuals to meet their daily and overall needs. However, elements such as having supportive colleagues, a positive work environment, and favorable workplace conditions can significantly enhance a person's happiness and quality of life. For instance, individuals who do not enjoy their relationships with coworkers or the conditions of their workplace tend to feel less satisfied with their jobs, even if they are earning a high salary. This serves as compelling evidence to support my viewpoint.Moreover, an essential source of job satisfaction often stems from professional accomplishments, the development of one's skills, and career advancement. In contrast, the joy derived from promotions or recognition from management can often surpass the gratification one gets from a high salary. For example, individuals stuck in monotonous jobs that offer no opportunities for progress or achievement often experience greater dissatisfaction, regardless of their lucrative pay.In conclusion, I contend that salary does not overshadow other motivational factors. Aspects like having friendly coworkers, favorable working conditions, and opportunities for professional growth are, in fact, equally or even more significant.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;In today's society, computers have become integral to daily life, with their impact also evident among children worldwide. While some may argue that excessive computer use can have negative effects on young users, this perspective overlooks the numerous advantages offered by computers. This will be illustrated by exploring how computers enable children to access a wealth of online resources for effective studying and developing foundational skills that will benefit them in their future careers.One of the greatest advantages of the internet is the vast array of information available in various formats—text, images, and videos—on nearly every topic. Through computers, children can easily access the internet to enhance their understanding of the subjects they are studying or are passionate about. For instance, students preparing for a speech can use online resources to gather detailed information on their topic. Without an understanding of computers, accessing such a wealth of information would be challenging. This is how computers positively influence children’s learning experiences.Moreover, computers allow individuals to create presentations, design intricate graphs and visuals, and efficiently document research. Children who are encouraged to engage with computers from an early age can develop these skills, positioning themselves ahead of their peers when entering the professional world. For example, students who create Microsoft PowerPoint presentations for school projects gain a competitive advantage in their early careers. This clearly illustrates the positive impact computers have on children.Given the significant contributions of computers to children's education and the skills that will serve them well in their future careers, it is evident that computers are a valuable resource for young learners. However, it is essential for parents to provide proper guidance to ensure their children navigate the digital landscape safely and effectively.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;Some people believe that children raised in less affluent families are quicker to adapt and better equipped to handle adult life challenges compared to their more privileged peers. However, I strongly disagree with this assertion.First and foremost, children from poorer backgrounds often fall into negative behaviors such as crime, theft, and violence. Additionally, they frequently lack access to quality education, which can leave them vulnerable to being influenced by harmful ideologies. For instance, many terrorist organizations seek to recruit uneducated individuals, as those with a solid educational foundation are typically more resistant to manipulation. In this regard, individuals with lower levels of education are more susceptible to such harmful beliefs.On the other hand, children from wealthy families benefit from access to quality education, which positively influences their future prospects. Furthermore, these children are often more adept at managing money because they have more opportunities to learn about financial matters. Lastly, affluent families can afford superior healthcare services and expensive medications, which significantly contribute to a child's overall well-being. Many effective treatments and medications are prohibitively expensive for families with limited financial resources.In conclusion, I reject the notion that children from less privileged backgrounds are more likely to succeed in life, for the reasons mentioned above.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;It is undoubtedly true that contemporary individuals are encountering a range of new health issues and ailments not seen in the past. Many attribute this rise to a sedentary lifestyle. While I acknowledge that this is a significant contributing factor, I believe that other elements are exerting an even greater influence.To start, I concur that a sedentary lifestyle leads to numerous serious health concerns. One major reason for people's increased tendency to spend entire days sitting at home is the advancement of technology. In earlier times, entertainment options were limited and often required physical activity, resulting in more outdoor engagement. Today, especially in urban areas, many individuals find themselves primarily seated in front of TVs or other devices.However, there are additional factors contributing to the prevalence of serious health problems. Firstly, modern environmental pollution has escalated significantly due to greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, leading to issues such as allergies for many individuals. Secondly, the consumption of low-quality foods, such as fast foods, junk foods, and genetically modified products, is having a detrimental effect on our health. Finally, life has become increasingly stressful due to recent challenges, including traffic congestion and accidents, among others.In light of these points, it is clear that various newly emerged health issues are a result of the factors mentioned above.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";Educational institutions vary in their approaches to introducing foreign languages to children. Some individuals advocate for starting foreign language instruction in preschool, while others argue for a later introduction. This topic has attracted attention in academic circles due to its impact on children's learning. I firmly believe that teaching a second language as early as kindergarten is crucial.Initially, during their kindergarten years, children may feel uncomfortable using a language other than their native one. It is essential that the learning environment is comfortable for them, using language they are familiar with. Furthermore, many educators worry that introducing a foreign language too early could lead to confusion for children who are still in the process of acquiring their first language. It is also vital that teachers are well-qualified to teach the specific language to ensure high-quality education.However, it is undeniable that children are exceptional learners, and their formative years provide the best opportunity for language acquisition. Although foreign language instruction may be new to them, their natural curiosity will motivate them to learn and understand. Consequently, acquiring a new language can feel instinctive for them. Additionally, this approach benefits both students and teachers, as it makes language learning easier for students when they encounter it again in their teenage years. Clearly, the benefits of introducing foreign languages early outweigh the drawbacks.In conclusion, while there are differing opinions on the timing of foreign language instruction, I am completely convinced that if schools effectively implement it as early as kindergarten, it will enhance children's learning abilities.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;With the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has seen significant growth over the past few decades. While some individuals argue that this trend has brought more challenges than advantages, I hold a different perspective.I acknowledge that tourism can negatively impact the natural environment. To accommodate the influx of visitors, local governments often construct additional facilities and infrastructure near tourist attractions, which can lead to the destruction of natural habitats. Moreover, tourism contributes to increased pollution and waste, including higher greenhouse gas emissions and excessive consumption of water, energy, and other resources in luxury hotels. These factors suggest that tourism may exert considerable pressure on ecosystems and local resources, and therefore, may warrant caution.Nevertheless, a thriving tourism sector can yield substantial benefits for the local economy. Tourists traveling to various destinations not only purchase tickets for attractions but also spend money on food, lodging, transportation, and entertainment. This influx of spending can generate significant revenue for both local residents and governments, creating numerous job opportunities in the process. Furthermore, the income generated from tourism can be reinvested into initiatives aimed at reducing pollution and protecting the environment.Additionally, the growth of tourism offers numerous advantages for travelers. The availability of direct flights enhances convenience and comfort, allowing visitors to enjoy their holidays to the fullest. With adequate local amenities and services, tourists can focus more on leisure and relaxation. Furthermore, both locals and travelers gain unprecedented access to diverse cultures, fostering greater open-mindedness and promoting mutual understanding between nations.In conclusion, the growth of tourism offers global benefits. Although some challenges are unavoidable, they are outweighed by the positive aspects and can be effectively addressed through appropriate measures.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;Education is undoubtedly crucial for individual development. While some argue that learning through television can be more effective for certain children, I have reservations about the idea of allowing students to spend increased time in front of screens. This perspective stems from the enduring value of traditional educational methods, which have proven to be the most effective approach. Encouraging physical inactivity in the pursuit of improving children's skills is not advisable.Firstly, traditional teaching methods have been scientifically validated and recognized as the optimal way to educate children. Although advances in technology have positively impacted the educational landscape, they have not diminished the critical role that teachers play in the classroom. For example, today's students often complete their homework and research using computers instead of visiting libraries, highlighting the shift in resources. However, digital screens cannot replace the presence of educators, whose knowledge and adaptability are invaluable. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that teachers cannot simply be substituted by screens.Additionally, watching television is a passive activity and should not be encouraged by extending the time children spend engaged in it. In contrast, children who participate in activities that foster creativity, collaboration, and healthy competition tend to excel overall. Research indicates that children exposed to various hands-on experiences in nature perform better in distinguishing between different types of plants or animals compared to those who primarily watch documentaries. These interactive activities equip children with essential skills that will benefit them in their future careers.In conclusion, although some children may thrive from learning through television, encouraging such passive behavior is not advisable. Schools have adhered to traditional teaching methods for centuries, and they continue to provide the most effective means of equipping children with vital skills.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;There is no doubt that we are living in an internet-driven era that significantly affects both personal and professional spheres. This impact is particularly evident in developed countries, where many individuals opt to work or study from home rather than commuting to an office or university. Some embrace this trend as beneficial, while others view it as detrimental. Both perspectives will be explored.On one side of the debate, the advantages of remote work or study are substantial. For instance, working from home allows individuals to achieve a better work-life balance. A prime example is a new mother who can manage her professional responsibilities while caring for her baby. Additionally, employees enjoy greater flexibility with their working hours. For students, studying from home presents an appealing alternative as they can eliminate travel time to universities and dedicate that time to their studies. In bustling cities like Tokyo, this can result in significant time savings. Thus, the perks of remote work or study are clearly advantageous.Conversely, some members of society question the productivity of those who choose to work or study from home. Many employers contend that employees working in isolation tend to spend excessive time communicating through phone calls or emails with coworkers, which can negatively impact their productivity. Similarly, teachers express concern that students may suffer since they cannot receive immediate assistance with academic questions, leading to gaps in their learning. These issues can significantly affect individuals who opt for remote work or study.Taking into account both viewpoints, it appears that the benefits of working or studying from home outweigh the drawbacks. It is anticipated that people will continue to leverage the internet for work and education, finding ways to mitigate the disadvantages in the foreseeable future.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;"I concur with both perspectives that international tourism can create tension as well as foster understanding among people from diverse cultural backgrounds. After conflicts or debates, most individuals tend to seek common ground and understanding.Undeniably, certain behaviors exhibited by tourists can be unwelcome in host communities. For instance, some visitors leave litter behind when exploring attractions, necessitating frequent clean-ups by local residents to ensure that subsequent tourists encounter a pleasant environment. Additionally, cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings; for example, Hindus abstain from eating beef due to their reverence for cows. In such cases, tourists who wish to show respect for local customs should refrain from ordering beef in local eateries.Conversely, efforts are being made to mitigate potential conflicts between visitors and locals by promoting cultural understanding. For instance, tourists often receive brochures outlining local traditions and customs prior to their arrival. Moreover, tour guides are eager to assist visitors in grasping the cultural nuances of their host country. As a result, the likelihood of conflicts diminishes as understanding grows between both parties.Clearly, people actively seek solutions, such as fostering understanding, when they face challenges arising from international tourism. Consequently, I believe that international tourism results in both tension and mutual understanding among people from different cultures."
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;Some individuals believe that celebrities are more recognized for their glamorous lifestyles than for their professional achievements. While I agree that this perception can adversely affect younger generations, it doesn’t apply universally to all ambitious celebrities.It is true that some celebrities tend to flaunt their wealth in public. For instance, certain movie stars enjoy donning luxury brand clothing and displaying their extravagant lifestyles in the media, which often draws public attention. If this behavior continues, it could create a misleading impression for young people, who might come to believe that an extraordinary life can be attained without hard work. As a result, they may prioritize the pursuit of celebrity status over dedication to their studies and work ethics, which can be harmful.On the other hand, I believe that many celebrities serve as positive role models for young people due to their visible achievements. For example, professional athletes demonstrate their skills and performance directly to their fans, illustrating how extensive training and effort correlate with success. This type of self-made celebrity can inspire children to cultivate their talents through hard work and determination. Furthermore, musicians like Michael Jackson have also attained remarkable success in their fields. His music, which resonates worldwide, has garnered immense popularity among younger audiences. His lyrics promote the idea of caring for one another, providing young people with a model for being responsible and compassionate members of society.In conclusion, while some celebrities may mislead young people with their ostentatious displays of wealth, others pave a positive path by showcasing the importance of hard work and personal achievement.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;Television is a significant source of information, and students can acquire and enhance various skills through its content. However, I am convinced that allowing students to watch TV both at home and at school can have detrimental effects on their overall development. Excessive screen time can harm their health and academic performance.Indeed, television serves as a valuable source of news and information. Stations like BBC, CNBC, ETV Gujarati, and ETV Marathi keep viewers informed about current events. Additionally, programs can help children cultivate skills in extracurricular activities. For instance, cooking shows offer insights into preparing various dishes, while sports broadcasts, such as cricket and football, teach essential skills like leadership, teamwork, and communication, all of which can benefit students in their future careers.On the flip side, prolonged TV viewing can have negative repercussions on children's health. For instance, excessive screen time can lead to poor eyesight at a young age, as well as back pain. Furthermore, students may be drawn to programs that are not age-appropriate, potentially resulting in significant psychological consequences. Many kids become addicted to their favorite shows, such as cartoons or sports, which can distract them from studying, especially during exams, ultimately affecting their academic performance.In conclusion, I believe the disadvantages of watching TV outweigh its advantages. If students are permitted to watch television freely without proper guidance from parents or teachers, the negative impacts on their development could be significant.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;Throughout history, each generation has demonstrated greater adaptability and progress compared to the previous one. This trend continues in today’s industrial society, where younger workers are often favored for employment and promotion over those aged 50 and older. There are three primary reasons for this disparity in responsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, older workers often struggle to adapt due to their static mindset. Having grown up in times marked by poverty and conflict, they tend to view the world with a more negative and pessimistic lens. This deeply rooted sense of hardship can lead to resistance to change and an unwillingness to embrace modern advancements. For instance, many older individuals would prefer to manually assemble machine parts rather than trust robots, driven by skepticism regarding the efficiency and safety of technological alternatives.Secondly, their responsiveness can also be linked to their approach to life. Many older workers are acutely aware of their declining health and may lack the enthusiasm that characterizes their younger counterparts. This preference for stability and routine contrasts sharply with the boldness and adventurous spirit often exhibited by younger individuals. It is evident that the success of numerous companies can be attributed to the innovative ideas of young employees who bring a much-needed fresh perspective.Finally, knowledge plays a crucial role in allowing younger workers to surpass their older colleagues. Employers are more likely to choose a young candidate who not only possesses a solid foundation in essential subjects but is also knowledgeable in programming and foreign languages, over an older individual with outdated skills. While we should not undermine the experience of older workers, their limited expertise in critical modern skills can hinder their competitiveness in today’s job market.In summary, workers over the age of 50 have largely been overshadowed by the next generation in various aspects. However, I believe it is vital to foster a harmonious coexistence between both groups for the continued success of any organization.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;"Technological advancements have reached unprecedented levels over the past few decades, particularly evident in the growing reliance on machines in our daily lives. These machines significantly reduce the physical labor required from humans. While some view this shift as a positive development, others argue it poses disadvantages for humanity. Both perspectives will be examined before a final conclusion is drawn.Many believe that increased reliance on machines can negatively impact human health, primarily because it diminishes physical activity. For instance, in numerous buildings, staircases have been largely replaced by elevators. People frequently choose lifts instead of climbing just one or two flights of stairs. Research has shown that the regular use of elevators in workplaces can contribute to obesity. This instance clearly illustrates the connection between machine usage and adverse health outcomes.Conversely, there are those who argue that machines simplify tasks and save time when completing comparable amounts of work. Consider the role of food processors in kitchens; functions such as chopping, blending, grating, and kneading have become so effortless that many can't envision their daily routines without these devices. Clearly, machines can make everyday chores more efficient and less burdensome.After evaluating both viewpoints, it can be concluded that the advantages of using machines outweigh the disadvantages. Although health concerns merit consideration, there are plenty of alternative methods for maintaining fitness. It is anticipated that as technology continues to progress, people will increasingly embrace the use of machines and find new ways to stay healthy."
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;In today's world, most countries are investing heavily in technology, as it is clear that technological advancements drive economic growth. However, many people believe that traditional practices should be phased out and discarded. I completely disagree with this perspective.Firstly, traditional skills and customs are an integral part of cultural identity. They differentiate nations from one another and reflect each country's unique creativity and intelligence. As a result, people take pride in their heritage and strive to preserve traditional practices. For instance, the methods of constructing houses vary from one country to another, showcasing their distinctiveness.Additionally, there are instances where traditional methods simply cannot be replaced by modern technology. Many individuals prefer traditional products due to their quality and durability. Handcrafted items, such as vases, are often more desirable. Moreover, certain crafts, like the creation of cone hats from leaves, require manual expertise. Not only is there no machine that can replicate this process, but hand-made items also possess an aesthetic appeal that adds to their economic value.Lastly, traditional skills and lifestyles play a crucial role in education. They provide young people with insights into history and the methods used by their ancestors. By reintroducing these practices to new generations, they may inspire innovative ideas that enhance contemporary life.In conclusion, while technology offers numerous benefits, traditional skills and practices hold immense value and will continue to endure.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;Modern cities can be described as melting pots, facing the challenge of traffic congestion due to overpopulation. This issue has garnered significant attention from city planners, with the belief that reducing the need for people to venture onto the streets is the only way to address the persistent problem of gridlock. However, I strongly disagree, as there are two effective alternatives to consider.First and foremost, enhancing public transportation is crucial for reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Buses and trains have long been integral to urban transport, demonstrating their efficacy as reliable options. On average, a bus can accommodate at least 30 passengers, while a train can carry nine to ten times that amount. Furthermore, underground train systems alleviate street congestion by allowing public transit to operate below ground, clearing the roads for buses and other environmentally-friendly vehicles. Together, these modes of transportation can significantly ease the overcrowding in many cities.Secondly, the often-overlooked potential of urban sprawl should be acknowledged. If large shopping malls and universities were to be relocated to suburban areas, city streets could become less bustling and crowded. Distributing major attractions across a wider region encourages the development of residential neighborhoods and alleviates pressure on public infrastructure. This approach can also help manage the influx of migrants and the unemployed in city centers.In conclusion, city planners should explore alternatives to personal vehicles and capitalize on suburban development. This strategy is particularly beneficial for developing nations like Vietnam and China, where the demand for jobs and education continues to rise.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;Young individuals worldwide are significantly influenced by media and celebrities, who captivate younger generations with their extravagant lifestyles. It is widely acknowledged that emulating these celebrities can pose risks to the youth. This assertion can be supported by examining how the health and behavior of young people are impacted when they look to celebrities as role models.To begin with, the uncritical following of celebrities can adversely affect the health of adolescents. Many young people find themselves engaging in substance abuse, including smoking, at an alarmingly early age. For instance, a survey conducted at a university revealed that around 40% of respondents cited a desire to emulate their favorite film star while smoking as their motivation for picking up the habit. This illustrates the harmful effects of celebrity imitation on the health of young individuals.Furthermore, it is argued that following celebrities can negatively influence the personalities of young people. Adolescents often mimic not just the fashion and makeup of their beloved stars, but also their attitudes and behaviors. A recent poll by an American magazine found that many parents and educators have expressed concern about teenagers using offensive language both at home and in school. This clearly indicates that the behavior of these glamorous celebrities can have a detrimental effect on the conduct of youth.In conclusion, it is evident that the adulation of celebrities can lead to negative consequences for young people's health and behavior. Such influences ultimately shape their personalities and future prospects. Therefore, it is essential to educate young individuals to avoid following celebrities blindly, encouraging them instead to concentrate on their careers and aspire for a brighter future.
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;Gender issues have been discussed for many years, focusing on solutions to achieve equality in the development of human resources. The implementation of equal educational rights and policies is viewed as a sustainable approach that should be prioritized. Currently, many institutions admit an equal number of male and female students across various courses, and I strongly support this initiative.The representation of women is increasing year by year in many regions of the world. This trend compels stakeholders to consider the preparations necessary to ensure stable economic growth and a high quality of life for all. We now see women working in diverse fields that were traditionally male-dominated, such as engineering and machine operations. These examples demonstrate that women are fully capable of performing jobs typically associated with men, indicating that female students possess the same potential and abilities as their male counterparts.Additionally, obtaining a higher education degree is essential for advancing one’s career. Today, it is increasingly difficult for young individuals to secure a good job without a university degree. History shows that education broadens knowledge and experience, preparing individuals for the realities of the workplace through college curricula. Therefore, providing equal educational opportunities for both men and women is essential.In conclusion, the demand for skilled professionals and degree holders is critical for career development, and this must apply to all genders. As the global landscape continues to evolve, prioritizing equitable access to education is imperative to meet future challenges.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;Across the globe, smoking has been widely recognized as a harmful and shameful habit. Millions of smokers succumb to diseases like lung and oral cancer, while non-smokers, or passive smokers, also face health risks when exposed to secondhand smoke. Given these dangers, there is a compelling argument for prohibiting smoking in public spaces such as bus and railway stations. This perspective can be supported by examining the positive outcomes that such a ban has on both the general public and smokers.Firstly, non-smokers would benefit significantly from implementing such restrictions. Before the 1980s, public places in Sri Lanka were characterized by rampant smoking, leading to uncomfortable situations and even conflicts in public transport. Since the enforcement of smoking bans, this issue has been effectively managed, resulting in a healthier environment for everyone.Moreover, instituting a smoking ban in public areas would serve as a strong deterrent against tobacco use. For example, a further crackdown on smoking in Sri Lanka's capital has led to a notable decline in smoking-related diseases and fatalities, according to the Ministry of Health. This evidence illustrates how smoking restrictions have successfully discouraged the habit, alleviating pressure on the country’s healthcare system.In summary, the experience of Sri Lanka in regulating smoking in public places has demonstrated significant benefits for its citizens. It is hoped that governments worldwide will take note of these advantages and consider similar smoking bans in public areas, following the example set by Sri Lanka and other nations.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;Tourism, which has a long history, can be seen as a contentious celebrity. While some argue that tourism leads to economic distortions, environmental harm, and irreversible damage to the places it touches, I firmly disagree with this perspective for two key reasons.Firstly, tourism is essential for fostering economic growth in a manner that benefits local communities. Often, tourist attractions are situated in remote or rural areas that have not previously flourished economically. The arrival of tourism investments—such as hotels and services—creates job opportunities and generates significant revenue for local residents. In other words, tourism helps to steer the local economy in a positive direction, maximizing its inherent potential.Secondly, while some environmental degradation may occur, tourism should not be held solely responsible. The transformation of a wilderness area into a tourist destination involves careful planning and attention to environmental sustainability. Substantial resources are invested in maintaining the natural landscape: companies often spend significant amounts on tree pruning, landscaping, and preserving local wildlife in order to enhance the beauty of these areas. Moreover, ecotourism has emerged as a responsible approach that engages environmentalists and nature enthusiasts alike in promoting awareness and conservation of ecosystems. Therefore, it is unfair to label tourism as detrimental to ecological diversity.In conclusion, tourism has demonstrated a positive impact on both the economies of the regions it touches and their environmental stewardship. I believe that integrating tourism with educational efforts is crucial for fostering a harmonious relationship between humans and their natural surroundings.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;The emergence of information technology (IT) over the past two decades has significantly enhanced both living standards and work productivity. However, it is also believed that this evolution has negative consequences. In my view, future advancements in IT are likely to come at the expense of its users.With the rapid pace of development, IT appears to have transformed users into dependents. While the Internet and email were once the primary tools of communication, the digital landscape now encompasses a myriad of distractions, including online gaming, streaming services, and various forms of social interaction, which continue to expand. These enticing options pull people away from reality and foster a reliance on technology. Moreover, the decline in soft skills, which are typically developed through outdoor activities, exacerbates this dependence, making time spent indoors with devices the preferred choice.Additionally, the future of IT raises concerns regarding health issues. Platforms like Skype, Viber, and Yahoo have made it possible to connect with anyone around the world with just a click. However, this convenience often discourages people from stepping outside their comfort zones, leading to social isolation and a sedentary lifestyle characterized by constant snacking and air conditioning. Consequently, this behavior can contribute to obesity, nearsightedness, diabetes, and various heart-related ailments.In conclusion, while IT has made valuable contributions to society, its impact on users' autonomy and well-being deserves careful consideration. I believe that changes are necessary to prevent IT from having a more adverse effect on individuals' lives.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;Since the beginning of time, humans have regarded meat as a key source of protein. For many families around the globe, meat has traditionally been the centerpiece of their meals. However, in recent years, there has been a notable surge in the number of vegetarians. Some attribute this trend to a growing concern for animal rights, while others believe the reasons extend beyond that. I believe that the primary motivations for people to avoid meat are health considerations and religious beliefs.First and foremost, health improvement is a significant factor contributing to the rising popularity of vegetarianism. Many researchers have found that various vegetables contain antioxidants that may help prevent cancer, reinforcing the idea that a plant-based diet can be beneficial for our health. While some argue that forgoing meat could lead to insufficient protein intake, it has been shown that various legumes, such as soybeans and peas, can provide comparable protein sources.Secondly, religious beliefs also play a crucial role in the choice to adopt a vegetarian diet. For instance, some religions, such as Buddhism, hold the view that animals were once humans in previous lives, suggesting that consuming their meat equates to eating the flesh of sentient beings we may have known. While this perspective may seem unscientific to some, I believe it is essential to adhere to one's religious practices, as they can lead to mental enlightenment.In conclusion, it is clear to me that individuals are drawn to vegetarianism primarily for health and religious reasons, rather than solely for animal welfare. Nonetheless, it is always advisable to maintain a nutritionally balanced diet, regardless of dietary choices.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;There is no doubt that the implementation of technological advancements in certain countries will bring about modern skills and new lifestyles. Some argue that these so-called cultural invasions will lead to the decline of national traditions, suggesting that there is no need to preserve them. However, I believe that rather than disappearing, traditions will evolve in their significance within society.It is clear that a country's culture is largely transmitted through traditional skills and ways of life. For example, in Vietnam, numerous water puppet shows that once showcased our seasonal agriculture and community activities have now been replaced by cinemas and music concerts. As a result, younger generations can only learn about their ancestors' earlier lives through books and images, which is a less immersive experience.Tradition encourages individuals to reflect on the past, primarily through traditional crafts and antique lifestyles, in order to progress. Understanding the struggles and triumphs of our predecessors can provide us with invaluable lessons for navigating contemporary challenges. Learning from their mistakes can also help us achieve our goals more smoothly.In conclusion, traditional skills and ways of life should never be substituted. They are essential for teaching us self-esteem and imparting valuable experiences. Thus, their preservation throughout history is deserving of our attention.
372;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime."" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the ""legalized revenge"" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.Finally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. To conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty.";"Capital punishment, often referred to as the death penalty, is a legal procedure through which the state executes a person as punishment for a crime. In recent years, many nations have reformed their death penalty laws. Globally, 51% of countries have abolished capital punishment, and this figure rises to 98% in Europe. Some argue that eliminating this punishment would lead to increased insecurity and a rise in violent crimes. Conversely, others contend that the death penalty is not necessary for controlling violence in society. In my view, there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that capital punishment effectively reduces crime rates for several reasons.Firstly, capital punishment represents a form of revenge that perpetuates a culture of violence. While crimes are already illegal and carry life-altering consequences, the state’s use of lethal punishment mirrors the violence of the original offense, albeit in a legally sanctioned manner. Additionally, it does not deter repeat offenders and often serves as a form of ""legalized revenge"" for the victims' families, failing to address the underlying issues of violence within society.Secondly, no one has the authority to take another human life. The right to life is fundamental to all human beings, and this right should not be forfeited, even by those who have committed serious crimes. Engaging in state-sanctioned killing reduces us to a cycle of criminality: if we execute a murderer, we risk becoming complicit in a similar act. Furthermore, resorting to killing as a solution raises ethical and moral concerns. Ultimately, capital punishment may contribute to an increase in crime rather than its reduction.Lastly, for some serious offenders, capital punishment serves as an easy escape from their responsibilities. Those who commit heinous acts should face appropriate punishment for their actions, and execution deprives them of the opportunity to truly atone for their crimes. In fact, why not impose more constructive penalties? Industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, and reclamation require a significant workforce; assigning offenders to meaningful labor could prove beneficial for society. Additionally, focusing on rehabilitation and education offers a more effective approach to preventing future offenses.In conclusion, capital punishment functions as a form of legalized revenge, offers an easy escape for serious criminals, and violates the fundamental right to life. Therefore, it neither deters violent crime nor is essential for maintaining social order. It is imperative for the world to reevaluate its stance on the death penalty and consider more humane alternatives."
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;For many years, zoos have served as a sanctuary for endangered species. However, some individuals argue that the existence of zoos is unjustifiable. In my view, zoos merit support and public appreciation for two main reasons.Firstly, zoos play a vital role in education by providing real-life experiences for learners. They offer students the opportunity to observe the behaviors and unique instincts of animals like lions and crocodiles up close. For university students, zoos serve as valuable resources for biological research, offering access to practical data and live observations that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. This illustrates how zoos contribute to knowledge acquisition across diverse educational levels.Secondly, zoos are crucial for ecological conservation. In today's world, the forces of globalization often encroach on natural habitats, necessitating the involvement of zoos. Additionally, the rising trend of illegal hunting poses a significant threat to rare and endangered species. Zoos provide a safe haven for animals such as giraffes, pandas, koalas, and leopards, offering them protected environments that are otherwise unavailable in the wild.In conclusion, the importance of zoos for both human society and wildlife is truly significant. It is essential to reevaluate our perceptions of zoos to ensure they can function at their highest potential.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";"The rising number of languages at risk of extinction has become a major concern in today's society. The question of whether our government should invest more resources into preserving these minority languages remains a topic of debate. Personally, I believe that every language, regardless of its number of speakers, deserves protection from extinction.There are several arguments suggesting that efforts to save regional languages may be an unjustifiable expense. Firstly, expanding the use of these languages could result in significant costs, particularly through the need for educational programs aimed at encouraging young people to learn and use them. For instance, in certain areas of Southern Vietnam, initiatives have been implemented to help secondary school students from the Khmer community speak their native language alongside Vietnamese. However, the local government has faced challenges due to the high costs associated with hiring language teachers, providing facilities, and acquiring appropriate materials. Additionally, it's evident that unifying communication, trade, cooperation, and transactions in a single language can streamline interactions within society.Despite these arguments, I firmly believe that the government should prioritize the preservation of minority languages. Language transcends mere communication; it embodies cultural history and the evolution of societies over thousands of years, deserving our respect and protection. Moreover, language plays a crucial role in shaping the unique identities and cultures around the world. Therefore, safeguarding these languages is vital for maintaining cultural diversity.In conclusion, while allowing the extinction of languages spoken by ethnic minorities might appear advantageous in certain respects, it would have far-reaching negative effects, particularly regarding the loss of our cultural heritage."
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";"A well-known adage in medicine states, ""Prevention is better than cure."" This raises the question of whether the government should invest a significant portion of the national health budget in education and preventive health initiatives. In my view, implementing this strategy is essential for two key reasons.Firstly, the integration of health education into school curricula, particularly at the primary level, is crucial for fostering awareness among young people. Students should learn about balanced diets, nutritious foods, and the dangers of unhealthy ones, equipping them with the knowledge needed to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, it is easier for children to develop positive habits early on, such as avoiding excessive consumption of fast food, fried foods, and harmful substances.Secondly, focusing on prevention can lead to significant economic advantages by reducing the incidence of certain diseases. Treating serious conditions like cancer or HIV can be exorbitantly expensive, often requiring vast sums just to extend life by a year or two. Conversely, if people engage in regular physical activity and embrace health-conscious products, the likelihood of developing costly issues such as obesity or myopia diminishes.In conclusion, I strongly support the shift from a treatment-centric approach to one that prioritizes health education and preventive strategies. This transition will not only enhance individuals’ physical and mental well-being but will also provide financial benefits."
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;University serves as a gateway to life, providing us with a wealth of knowledge and values essential for success. This significance brings forth the question of whether only the top-performing students should be granted access to higher education or if the opportunity should extend to any ambitious young individuals. Both perspectives warrant discussion before arriving at a conclusion.Firstly, high-achieving academic students are well-suited for university due to their intellectual prowess. Such students can easily grasp complex concepts that might overwhelm their peers who lack similar skills. Moreover, it is only fair that those who have worked diligently should reap the benefits of their efforts. University can be viewed as a reward for those who have dedicated themselves to their studies.On the other hand, university is not solely a hub for academic learning but also a nurturing ground for artistic expression and the development of interpersonal skills. Thus, it should be accessible to a broader range of young people who are eager to explore their passions and grow holistically.Furthermore, limiting university access to only the top students could lead to a rise in social issues. Those who are discouraged by such restrictions may find it challenging to transition into the workforce, particularly in competitive fields, as they might lack the necessary preparation.In conclusion, while there are merits to restricting university access, the drawbacks may outweigh the benefits. I believe that higher education should be made available to a diverse array of learners.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;In recent times, there has been increasing concern about who plays the most pivotal role in a child's education: parents or teachers. Children are influenced significantly by both of these key figures in their lives, each contributing to their overall development. Personally, I believe that teachers are often the better option for children's education in several important ways.Firstly, teachers possess greater qualifications than parents when it comes to educational expertise. For instance, acquiring a teaching certificate requires years of training in educational theory and practice. In contrast, parents may lack the specialized knowledge needed to effectively teach subjects like mathematics and physics to their children.Moreover, educators are professionals with extensive experience in fostering communication skills among children. After years of teaching, they develop the ability to help children cultivate essential life skills, such as setting personal boundaries, tackling future challenges, and resolving conflicts. On the other hand, parents often struggle with generational gaps, which can hinder their capacity to manage family disputes effectively.Additionally, parents typically have less time to devote to their children's education. In today's world, many families face economic pressures that necessitate both parents working, leading to limited opportunities for them to engage in teaching. Consequently, it becomes challenging for parents to fulfill the role of a good educator.In conclusion, teachers are ideally positioned to provide a quality education for children. They not only enhance children's academic skills but also impart crucial social and communication abilities necessary for navigating our competitive society.
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;As the physical demands of modern life continue to rise, salary has emerged as a key factor influencing career choices for many individuals. However, I believe that there are numerous other elements that deserve equal consideration alongside income when selecting a job. In the following paragraphs, I will outline and discuss my viewpoints on this matter.On one hand, I acknowledge that financial compensation is crucial for fulfilling our basic needs. People often prioritize high-paying jobs not only to support themselves but also to provide for their families' essential living requirements, including food, clothing, housing, education, and healthcare. For instance, those working in creative fields such as art or painting may struggle to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, as their passion for their craft often comes with lower income compared to other career options.On the other hand, I firmly believe that a genuine passion for one’s work can lead to greater success in that field. Many individuals who are now thriving in competitive areas like singing, dancing, or painting once faced significant challenges. Additionally, factors such as job satisfaction, happiness, interpersonal relationships, professional development, work environment, and the quality of management and colleagues should not be overlooked. Furthermore, some individuals choose their careers out of a desire to make a positive impact on their communities and contribute to society.In conclusion, while it is true that income plays a critical role in career decisions, I contend that pursuing a job we are passionate about can lead to genuine fulfillment and ultimately pave the way for greater financial success in the long run.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;There is no doubt that our lives have improved since the advent of cars. Nevertheless, private vehicles, in particular, have put significant strain on both the environment and the economy due to excessive oil consumption. While many advocate for imposing high taxes on petrol and diesel, I firmly disagree with this perspective. It is undeniable that increased taxation on fuel could deter people from using personal vehicles. Such taxes could potentially address environmental concerns by encouraging a shift towards public transportation options like trains, buses, or ferries. Furthermore, those who already own cars may limit their usage for long trips or in congested urban areas.However, imposing higher taxes on fossil fuels could have unintended consequences, such as driving inflation. Specifically, as petrol prices rise, the cost of essential goods like rice, meat, and vegetables is likely to increase as well. This could force consumers to seek out cheaper alternatives, leading to an oversupply of certain goods and potentially triggering an economic crisis.Additionally, it's important to consider that countries reliant on oil imports may find themselves increasingly dependent on exporting nations, both politically and economically. If exporting countries decide to reduce their oil supply, importing nations would face higher costs and may be compelled to adopt policies that favor the exporters. For instance, the recent U.S. involvement in the Russian crisis was largely influenced by oil supply dynamics.In conclusion, while there are advantages and disadvantages to rising fuel and petrol costs, the potential drawbacks—particularly regarding economic and political factors—seem to outweigh the benefits. Therefore, it would be wise to explore alternative strategies for reducing the reliance on personal vehicles.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;The rising prevalence of street crime has prompted police forces to carry firearms, becoming a pressing concern for many members of today’s society. Some individuals believe that this trend not only mirrors but also exacerbates the overall violence in our communities. I completely agree with this perspective for several reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following paragraphs.To begin with, it is important to recognize that when police officers are armed with guns or other legal weapons, it is primarily for their protection and the safety of civilians. However, modern criminals are increasingly sophisticated and invest significant resources into acquiring advanced weaponry to confront law enforcement and pursue their criminal activities. Consequently, innocent bystanders may inadvertently become victims of gunfire from both police and offenders. Furthermore, the use of firearms during encounters can lead to the destruction of property, including vehicles, homes, and public spaces. As a result, communities where law enforcement is armed are often perceived as highly violent.Additionally, police forces tend to be armed in areas with elevated crime rates, which means residents and law enforcement are frequently exposed to a range of serious offenses such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, and arson. These are clear indicators of a society grappling with significant levels of violence.In conclusion, while the presence of firearms in law enforcement may be necessary, it contributes to an escalation in violence. To mitigate this issue, the government should implement strict regulations on weapon possession and provide comprehensive training for police officers to minimize their impact on the lives of civilians.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;In today's world, technology is essential in nearly every aspect of life. In the field of education, it is widely acknowledged that technology enhances students' academic performance. I believe that the wealth of resources and the convenience technology offers are two key factors that facilitate student progress.Firstly, since the advent of technology, students have gained access to a vast array of information, which significantly broadens their horizons. The internet, for instance, provides knowledge through various mediums such as news articles, podcasts, recordings, and research across numerous fields. This allows students not only to explore relevant subjects but also to engage in discussions with individuals from around the globe.Another advantage of technology for students is the reduction in learning time. Modern tools like MP3 players, mobile phones, and laptops enable learners, particularly language students, to listen to audio files or read documents anytime and anywhere. This convenience allows them to develop their skills more rapidly. Furthermore, the internet serves as an endless source of visual aids, including educational games, sounds, and images, which help students grasp abstract concepts taught in the classroom more quickly and effectively.In conclusion, I fully support the integration of technology in education, as it enhances the availability of information and accelerates the learning process for students. It is highly beneficial to extend the application of technology beyond education to improve every aspect of life, creating a brighter future for all.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;It is clear that technological advancements have brought numerous benefits, significantly enhancing human comfort and convenience. While some individuals argue that this progress also leads to serious drawbacks in our lives, I personally disagree with this perspective. In the following paragraphs, I will analyze both sides of the issue and present my own viewpoint.Firstly, it is undeniable that modern technology has dramatically improved the quality of human life. Innovations such as air conditioners, computers, smartphones, and washing machines are among the greatest inventions that help people alleviate stress and free up time for other activities. Furthermore, the application of technology in medicine plays a crucial role in saving countless lives.On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge the negative aspects of technological progress. Despite the many advantages, the production of technological products has had a detrimental impact on the natural environment. The extraction and processing of raw materials and essential fuels for manufacturing can lead to significant environmental degradation. Additionally, technology may stifle creativity in certain demographics, particularly among children and young people, as they may become overly reliant on existing innovations.In conclusion, I firmly believe that technology has made significant contributions to our lives and to civilization as a whole. We cannot overlook the profound impact of technological advancements on human existence. However, it is essential to manage and mitigate its negative effects in a more responsible manner.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";The prevalence of excessive violence in television programs has emerged as a significant concern for society. The commonly accepted solution advocated by many governments worldwide is to reduce such content in TV shows. In my view, it is crucial for governments to minimize violent elements in children's programming, while allowing them to remain in shows intended for adult audiences.It is true that decreasing the amount of violent content in television could lead to a reduction in overall crime rates. However, to address this issue more effectively, governments must first impose strict regulations prohibiting any violent content in all children's television programs. Due to their cognitive immaturity, most young children struggle to distinguish right from wrong. Consequently, exposure to violent programming can make them more aggressive and increase their likelihood of delinquent behavior. Therefore, it is essential for governments to enact stringent laws that prevent minors from watching violent TV shows and movies.On the other hand, enforcing such restrictions on programming designed for adults would infringe upon their civil liberties. Many adults enjoy horror films or war movies as a way to unwind after a hectic day. For these individuals, such media serves purely as a source of entertainment and relaxation. Given that adults are capable of taking responsibility for their actions, they should retain the right to watch the shows and films that interest them.In summary, I believe that violent content should be removed from children's programming to help reduce juvenile delinquency, but adults should not be penalized by this policy.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The rate of crime is rising rapidly across the globe. Some people argue that this trend is due to the frequent use of guns by police to address criminal acts. Personally, I disagree with this viewpoint, as I believe that other factors contribute to the slight increase in violence.On one hand, I acknowledge that police have a responsibility to combat violence in urban and suburban areas, and that they may need to use firearms. A notable example of this occurred in the United States, where a man killed more than ten people in a cinema before police shot him in the foot to subdue him. Clearly, police officers can compel a criminal to surrender when armed, as their weapons serve to prevent potentially dangerous criminals from escaping. Therefore, it is essential for police to be equipped with effective weapons to safeguard the public and reduce violence.On the other hand, several reasons contribute to the significant rise in violent crime in communities. Firstly, the unemployment rate has surged to 15% in both globalized and non-globalized countries, leaving many qualified and educated individuals struggling to make ends meet. Secondly, the high cost of living in major cities places immense pressure on those living below the poverty line, often pushing them to desperate measures to fulfill their basic needs. For instance, many beggars resort to pickpocketing on public transportation.In conclusion, I believe that the use of firearms by police is not a primary driver of increased violence. Rather, issues such as unemployment play a critical role in fostering criminal activity within society. In my opinion, the focus should be on reducing unemployment to help prevent crime.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";It is obvious that no student can achieve success in school without support from others. Their accomplishments can be attributed to a variety of external factors. While some argue that parents are the most significant influence on their children's success, I believe that classmates play a crucial role in individual achievements.Firstly, classmates create a competitive environment that motivates students. For instance, in high school, it is difficult for an individual to resist studying diligently when surrounded by peers who are equally ambitious and aiming for prestigious universities worldwide. Psychologically, the pressure felt from being in competition with their peers can serve as a powerful motivator, ultimately enhancing academic performance.Additionally, when it comes to learning and knowledge acquisition, classmates are unparalleled. Students spend more time together than with their parents, which allows them to absorb a wealth of knowledge from one another. This can include classroom lessons, social skills, or essential etiquettes that parents might overlook. Sharing the same age group enables children to comfortably exchange ideas, ask questions, and explore abstract concepts without the fear of parental repercussions, leading to a deeper understanding of the material.In conclusion, considering all these factors, classmates offer unparalleled support to children, providing significant motivation and opportunities for growth—two essential components for achieving success in school.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;"More and more individuals are relocating to urban areas for their lifestyle. While city life offers numerous advantages, I firmly believe that it adversely impacts people's health.One major contributing factor to the declining quality of life in cities is environmental pollution. Emissions from vehicles, particularly cars, and industrial waste can lead to various respiratory illnesses. Furthermore, water pollution poses a significant health risk; harmful bacteria and contaminants in polluted water can enter the human body and cause severe health issues, potentially leading to death if not treated promptly.Additionally, the safety of food in large cities is often questionable. Recent studies have shown that toxic foods are widely available in the marketplace. Overcrowding in urban areas can also lead to an increased risk of infectious diseases, with ailments such as coughs, colds, and other illnesses spreading more easily. Moreover, living in cities often means residing in high-crime neighborhoods. Unemployed individuals or school dropouts may resort to criminal activities ranging from petty theft to serious offenses like burglary, pickpocketing, vandalism, smuggling, or even murder, making it increasingly challenging to earn a living and maintain a healthy lifestyle.In conclusion, I believe that urban living can have detrimental effects on people's health. Therefore, both government and individuals must take action to mitigate these consequences."
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;Some individuals may contend that permitting police officers to carry firearms could escalate violence in society. However, I primarily disagree with this perspective, as I believe that violent behavior stems from criminal intent rather than lax gun regulations.Firstly, while it might seem logical that tighter gun control would lead to a decrease in crime—fewer firearms generally translate to less violence—the reality is more complex. In fact, stringent gun regulations do not necessarily lower violence and crime rates, as a significant portion of gun crimes involves weapons acquired illegally. Those determined to engage in criminal activities or exert control through gang violence will find ways to obtain firearms, regardless of legal restrictions.Additionally, lawbreakers exist in every society, whether they are police officers or ordinary citizens. Thus, the root cause of violence lies in the mindset of criminals, not in the weapons themselves. Therefore, if a government aims to reduce crime within a community, it must focus on managing the behavior of individuals rather than merely regulating the firearms used in violent incidents.In conclusion, it is clear that there is little correlation between police officers carrying guns and an increase in violence. Instead, criminal intent appears to be more closely linked to violent acts. Consequently, we should prioritize addressing behavioral issues in order to effectively reduce crime, rather than concentrating solely on gun control measures.
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;Education is an essential economic component that significantly impacts a nation's budget each year. In many industrialized nations, efforts are consistently made to ensure that education is accessible and affordable for everyone. I firmly believe that education is the most crucial element in the advancement of a country.In developing nations, many families struggle to send their children to school. While there are government schools that offer free or low-cost tuition, these institutions are often limited in number and predominantly located in urban areas. Children living in rural mountains or remote islands often lack the means to reach these schools. Many of their parents work as farmers or fishermen and face food insecurity, making it nearly impossible for them to afford transportation for their children. Consequently, these children miss out on educational opportunities and are likely to follow in their parents' footsteps, perpetuating a cycle of poverty.Development through education doesn't solely entail producing a nation filled with doctors, lawyers, or engineers. Basic education equips children with fundamental reading and writing skills, while supplementary education imparts valuable knowledge and information. More specialized education can provide individuals with the necessary skills to earn a living and achieve self-sufficiency. An educated individual can make informed decisions and exhibit sound judgment. Similarly, a skilled person can make positive contributions to society and become an asset to their community. Collectively, the advantages of education can uplift individuals, enrich societies, and drive national development.In summary, education is vital to a country's socioeconomic progress. The greater the number of educated individuals in a nation, the stronger its potential for development becomes.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";"Some individuals claim that adolescents are negatively influenced by untalented people who gain fame through their extravagant lifestyles and wealth. However, I partially disagree with this perspective. Firstly, it's true that those who use their wealth to position themselves as role models are not ideal examples for young people. We certainly don’t want our children emulating those who flaunt luxury without demonstrating any real talent or skill. Nevertheless, today’s youth are generally very aware of positive role models. They often receive education from their families and schools that helps them discern what is beneficial for them. As a result, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for unworthy influences to sway young people who are equipped with essential life skills. Furthermore, it seems that very few individuals can thrive in the celebrity world without possessing some form of talent or accomplishment. Platforms like The Voice, X Factor, and Next Top Model provide opportunities for teenagers to showcase their abilities. Consequently, to become a star and inspire others, one must demonstrate genuine talent to stand out among the competition. Thus, mere wealth and superficial glamour are no longer sufficient for recognition; tangible achievements are essential for becoming a beacon of inspiration for the younger generation. In conclusion, in today’s evolving landscape, individuals lacking talent struggle to achieve fame, and to gain respect, they must positively contribute to younger audiences. This shift indicates that celebrities today have a more favorable impact on young people compared to earlier times."
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;There has been growing concern regarding the potential negative impact of mobile phones on our social lives. Widely adopted by individuals of all ages, I believe that this significant invention of the 21st century is contributing to several issues within our society.Firstly, excessive time spent on mobile phones can adversely affect our social skills. For instance, as individuals—particularly teenagers—become increasingly absorbed in their screens, they may lose interest in essential daily activities like meeting friends. This decline in face-to-face communication could hinder the development of their negotiation and interpersonal skills in the future. Additionally, prolonged phone use can lead to negative effects on children's eyesight and physical posture, making frequent mobile use quite harmful.Moreover, the rise of mobile games can influence mental development negatively. Numerous game applications, many of which are aggressive, reward children for violent actions, such as defeating monsters or attacking other players. This exposure may foster aggressive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors, resulting in more frequent conflicts during social interactions.Nonetheless, it’s important to view this issue from multiple perspectives. Mobile phones, particularly smartphones, have revolutionized communication, making it easier and more convenient. With many telecommunications companies offering internet access on phones, individuals can send instant messages and make international calls without cost, effectively bridging communication gaps.In conclusion, while mobile phones facilitate quicker communication, they also contribute to various social issues, such as the deterioration of children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, I strongly believe that we should use mobile phones in moderation to prevent these significant problems.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;Today, numerous countries are increasingly aware of environmental issues. Some argue that the responsibility for protecting the environment should lie solely with the government and large corporations, leaving ordinary citizens out of the equation. In my opinion, both the government and individuals should share this responsibility, although we must consider specific contexts.On one hand, addressing certain environmental challenges requires substantial financial resources and advanced technologies, which governments and corporations are equipped to provide. For example, concerns about air pollution and water quality affect many nations. Governments can implement policies and allocate funding to mitigate air pollution, while companies can invest in technology to reduce harmful emissions and contaminated waste. Individual citizens often lack the means to address such large-scale issues.Furthermore, governments and corporations play a crucial role in shaping public awareness of environmental matters. It is vital for every citizen to understand the importance of protecting the environment. This entails communicating relevant policies and knowledge to the public. Since the government controls many influential media outlets, such as television and newspapers, it can effectively disseminate valuable environmental information and policies to the population.On the other hand, ordinary individuals can also engage in actions to protect the environment and reap the benefits of a cleaner ecosystem. For example, the extensive use of private cars contributes to air pollution, and excessive reliance on plastic packaging has negative environmental effects. By making gradual changes in their daily habits, individuals can significantly impact environmental improvement.In conclusion, while governments and corporations should shoulder a larger share of the responsibility for environmental issues, every citizen also has a role to play in fostering a healthier planet.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;In today's world, both print and electronic media devote significant amounts of airtime and space to in-depth reports on criminal activities. I firmly believe that such details should be strictly censored, if not outright banned.It is well known that the media presents criminal content primarily to boost newspaper sales and television ratings. Nowadays, the main objective of journalists covering criminal events is often less about informing the public and more about increasing viewership and circulation. As a result, much of the crime coverage tends to be biased, sensationalized, or even misleading, which can instill fear in communities and leave law-abiding citizens increasingly anxious about crime.Moreover, an even more troubling issue is that detailed crime reports in the press may serve as instructional material for potential criminals, providing them with guidance they might struggle to find elsewhere. This could enable those planning criminal acts to refine their strategies, sidestep obstacles, and evade law enforcement more effectively. Consequently, without the regulation of crime-related details, unlawful behavior may become more prevalent, undermining social harmony.Additionally, graphic coverage of serious crimes can further traumatize victims who have already endured significant suffering. Reporting on their experiences without consent can exacerbate their mental anguish and, in some cases, lead to desperate actions.In conclusion, I strongly believe that descriptions of crimes should no longer go unchecked, as they may be false, could contribute to rising crime rates, and may intensify the suffering of victims.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;In our technologically advanced era, many individuals tend to overlook the significance of teaching handwriting to children. For some, it is perceived as a tedious and time-consuming endeavor. However, I believe that children should receive instruction in handwriting for several compelling reasons.Despite the advantages offered by modern technology, handwriting remains an essential aspect of students' education. Firstly, it serves as a fundamental skill utilized in various activities such as note-taking, homework, and writing in general. Mastering handwriting can enhance students' spelling abilities and support those facing reading or writing challenges. With guidance from parents or teachers, children can reap the benefits of practicing their handwriting. This practice encourages them to focus more on content, elaborate on details, and enhance their organizational skills.Moreover, it is crucial for parents and schools to prioritize handwriting instruction, as poor handwriting can adversely affect students' academic performance. Children with subpar handwriting often struggle to take notes effectively and keep up with lessons, leading to gaps in information and a lack of detail in their work. Additionally, the growing reliance on advanced technology may lead to a decline in students' writing skills, making them more complacent. For instance, with the help of automatic grammar and spell-check tools in word processing software, students may become less vigilant about noticing their mistakes.In conclusion, regardless of the speed and convenience that modern technology offers for writing, handwriting remains an essential skill for everyone, particularly for young students.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";Some parents who opt for private schooling for their children argue that the taxes they pay for public education are excessive. However, I firmly believe that these taxes are crucial.Firstly, by contributing to public school funding through taxes, wealthier individuals play a significant role in reducing the disparity between rich and poor. Many low-income families struggle to afford tuition fees for their children. By paying these taxes, affluent individuals can support numerous students from disadvantaged backgrounds, enabling them to pursue their education and improve their quality of life.Secondly, reducing taxes for parents of children in private schools would lead to inefficient use of public funds. Such a reduction would complicate tax calculations, necessitating a larger workforce to manage the complexities of this system. Additionally, the government would incur higher costs for staffing, which would divert funds from critical public sectors like education and healthcare.Many parents advocating for tax reductions argue that it is unjust for them to pay taxes for services they do not utilize. They assert that it is unreasonable to require them to fund something that their children do not benefit from. However, we also pay for public services, such as police and fire departments, even if we do not directly utilize them. We certainly do not expect tax reductions for those services.In summary, I strongly believe that taxes for public education should be mandatory for all members of society, regardless of the school their children attend.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;There is widespread sentiment that the government should allocate more funds to public services instead of the arts, such as music and theatre. However, I believe that both public services and the arts deserve investment.It is clear that essential public services, like hospitals and schools, are deserving of every dollar spent. Investing in hospitals enhances public health, while funding for schools improves our children's education. If these facilities are not adequately financed, our quality of life would suffer.However, our quality of life also relies on another important aspect: our spiritual well-being, which is closely connected to the arts. The arts encompass various forms, with music and cinema being particularly prominent. These two art forms not only entertain the public but also make significant contributions to the economy. For instance, industries like K-pop and Hollywood generate millions of dollars in revenue for the government, and they cannot thrive without government financial support.In summary, both the arts and public services are crucial to the community and should receive appropriate levels of investment.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;In today's world, technology is advancing rapidly, influencing various facets of our lives. While some believe that technological progress threatens traditional cultures, I contend that, although the impact of technology on culture is significant, it has also played a vital role in the preservation of these traditions.Modern technology has undoubtedly enhanced our lives through various gadgets. The advent of mobile phones and the internet has transformed our traditional methods of communication and work, making tasks far less labor-intensive than in the past, thanks to the use of electrical machinery. However, these innovations have also led to the decline of many traditional practices. For example, factories outfitted with modern, high-efficiency systems have largely replaced handcrafted goods. The exchange of letters among friends has become rare, replaced by emails and social networks, and new video games have overtaken physical ones. Consequently, many aspects of traditional culture have faded as a result of technological progress.Nonetheless, despite these drawbacks, technology has also contributed to the preservation and study of traditional cultures in several ways. The internet has provided younger generations with access to the cultural identities of nations from around the globe. Advanced methods have enabled the restoration and preservation of many artistic masterpieces, while modern tools assist researchers in studying ancient societies in greater depth, uncovering more cultural artifacts.In summary, modern technology has influenced traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;"There is a perspective that universities and colleges should enroll an equal number of male and female students in every faculty. However, I do not share this viewpoint, as there are significant differences between male and female students in terms of their characteristics.On one hand, boys and girls exhibit diversity in their psychological tendencies and individual traits. Generally, male students often engage their left-brain functions more predominantly, leading them to be more rational and logical in many instances. For example, there tends to be a higher representation of male scientists and engineers worldwide. Many boys are drawn to fields like science and technology, while a larger number of girls typically prefer studying areas such as literature, education, and the arts. Additionally, girls often gravitate towards careers focused on emotional intelligence and communication, such as teaching, singing, and interpreting. This indicates substantial differences between boys and girls in terms of mindset and behavior, with each gender excelling in particular domains.Moreover, requiring equal representation of genders in specific subjects could negatively impact students if their choices do not align with their personality traits and developmental needs. For instance, placing a girl interested in literature into an engineering program may hinder her ability to engage with the material, potentially stunting her future career prospects.On the other hand, universities should actively encourage more girls to pursue science-focused subjects and more boys to explore the humanities. This approach could help address gender imbalances in certain disciplines. It is important to recognize that studying in a single-gender environment can affect students' mental health.In conclusion, universities must honor individual subject choices due to the inherent diversity between boys and girls; we cannot impose a strict gender balance across all subjects."
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;"Celebrities, particularly movie stars, are often portrayed in the media as living lavish lifestyles or dating new partners. This fascination with celebrities is a natural inclination, especially among young people, which is why the media tends to prioritize celebrity news coverage. However, I believe this trend is concerning and can have a detrimental effect on children.The predominant image of celebrities is that they are wealthy and achieve success without hard work. This portrayal can lead children to believe that academic efforts and diligence are unnecessary for building a successful career and making a living. Consequently, they may come to undervalue the efforts of others and take achievements for granted.Moreover, not all celebrities serve as positive role models. The media often highlights instances of celebrities engaging in criminal behavior or indulging in substance abuse and tumultuous personal lives. This can mislead children into thinking that such lifestyles are aspirational or ""cool,"" especially in the absence of proper guidance from their parents.However, it’s important to note that some celebrities—such as authors and dedicated entrepreneurs—can inspire children. These individuals often share compelling stories and show how to pursue meaningful goals that can lead to positive changes in the world.In summary, the media should consider shifting its focus away from celebrity coverage. Additionally, access to celebrity news for children should be limited to those who present positive examples, allowing them to learn from figures who promote constructive values."
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today’s society, the welfare state concept necessitates that governments ensure sustainable healthcare and health education for their citizens. I wholeheartedly support the notion that a larger share of health budgets should be allocated to health education and preventative measures.Firstly, investing more in education and preventative initiatives can significantly improve our health system. By reducing the number of patients requiring treatment, hospitals and healthcare facilities can operate more efficiently, ultimately providing better care for those who are currently seeking help. Therefore, it is essential for society to be educated about health issues so that individuals can take proactive steps to prevent illnesses, rather than relying solely on treatment for a growing patient population.Secondly, enhancing funding for disease prevention and health education is crucial for the well-being of society. In my view, health is the most important aspect of human life, and overall happiness and welfare stem from good health. Thus, it is the government’s responsibility to provide resources that empower citizens to understand how to prevent potential illnesses that can lead to suffering. For example, Turkey's Ministry of Health launched a successful marketing campaign aimed at addressing smoking among the youth, which resulted in improved well-being for those who quit and adopted healthier lifestyles.In conclusion, a larger portion of health budgets should be dedicated to education and prevention rather than treatment, as this will lead to a more effective health system and enhanced overall well-being.
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;In today's society, raising children can be quite challenging for families, the fundamental units of our community. While the mother's role is crucial in a child's development, I firmly believe that fatherhood is equally essential to healthy parenting.One compelling reason to view fatherhood as equal to motherhood is the nature of parenting itself. In my opinion, parental role models significantly influence a child's development. For instance, in a traditional Turkish family, a mother's nurturing and compassionate approach complements a father's authoritative and guiding presence, helping to foster well-behaved children.Another reason I assert the importance of fatherhood is the evolving dynamics of contemporary relationships. We live in a time that emphasizes gender equality across all aspects of life, including family structures. The traditional model of a woman as a housewife caring for children while a man serves as the sole breadwinner is increasingly outdated. Today, domestic responsibilities and childcare duties are shared equally and interchangeably among partners.
