0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;The debate over whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate is a nuanced one, with valid arguments on both sides. Proponents of competition argue that it fosters a spirit of excellence and drives individuals to reach their full potential. In a competitive environment, children learn to set goals, persevere, and thrive under pressure, skills that undeniably contribute to economic development and innovation. The education system often mirrors these competitive aspects, preparing students for a world where only the strongest ideas and businesses flourish.However, when examining this issue more closely, it's crucial to recognize that the primary focus should not solely be on societal output but also on the moral and emotional development of the individual child. Teaching children to cooperate emphasizes the importance of interpersonal skills, which are invaluable regardless of professional success. Through cooperation, children learn communication, empathy, and conflict resolution. These skills are critical for building strong relationships, whether in personal life or in professional environments.Furthermore, in a world that is increasingly interconnected, collaboration is often more effective than individual competition. Many workplaces value teamwork and the ability to work harmoniously with others over competitive individualism. By emphasizing cooperation during formative years, we raise a generation better equipped to tackle societal challenges collectively.In conclusion, while competition can be beneficial in promoting economic growth and instilling a drive for personal achievement, it should not overshadow the essential lessons of cooperation. Children who learn to work together will not only become more socially adept but will also contribute to a more cohesive society. By integrating both competition and cooperation in educational paradigms, we can prepare children to become well-rounded adults, ready to succeed and contribute positively to their communities.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;Over the last 50 years, the number of individuals migrating to other countries has surged dramatically. This trend has spurred discussions about the extent to which immigrants should adapt to their new surroundings. While some argue that immigrants ought to abandon their old ways and embrace local customs fully, I strongly disagree with this perspective. I believe that sustaining one’s cultural identity is essential and allows individuals to navigate and thrive in multicultural environments.The adoption of local customs can lead to a sense of belonging and acceptance within the host community. However, expecting immigrants to completely forsake their heritage undermines their unique identities and backgrounds. Cultural diversity enriches societies, fostering creativity, innovation, and understanding between different communities. When immigrants retain their cultural identities, they contribute to the multicultural tapestry of their adopted countries, enhancing social cohesion rather than diminishing it.Moreover, maintaining one’s cultural heritage enables immigrants to preserve their origin values, which can serve as a foundation for their family structures and community ties. For many, cultural traditions and practices are deeply intertwined with their identities and provide emotional support in often challenging circumstances of adapting to a new environment. Celebrating one’s cultural practices—be it through festivals, cuisine, or language—can promote intercultural dialogue and understanding, benefiting both immigrants and local populations.In conclusion, while adapting to local customs is important for integration into society, it should not require the abandonment of one’s cultural identity. A harmonious blend of traditions can lead to richer, more inclusive communities. Rather than insisting that immigrants conform entirely to the norms of their host countries, we should encourage a mutual respect for diverse cultures, thus allowing everyone to thrive in an increasingly globalized world.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;"International tourism has grown exponentially over the last decade, with millions of travelers flocking to witness natural wonders, ancient heritage sites, and rich cultural experiences around the globe. This surge has sparked a debate about its ramifications; while some individuals argue that it brings negative impacts to host countries, I contend that international tourism significantly contributes to economic development and plays a vital role in preserving both culture and the environment.One of the most compelling arguments in favor of international tourism is its economic benefits. Many countries rely heavily on tourism as a major source of income. It provides job opportunities in various sectors, including hospitality, transportation, and local crafts, thus fostering community development. For instance, nations like Thailand and Greece have been able to bolster their economies through tourism, as visitors inject capital into local businesses. Increased tourist demand also encourages infrastructure improvements, such as better roads, airports, and public services, which can enhance the overall quality of life for residents.Moreover, tourism often plays a critical role in the preservation of culture and the environment. When tourists flock to heritage sites or natural wonders, there is often a greater incentive for local governments and communities to protect and maintain these treasures. By generating awareness and financial support for conservation programs, international tourism can lead to the safeguarding of historically and ecologically significant areas. For example, many UNESCO World Heritage sites benefit from the funds generated through entrance fees and guided tours, which in turn support preservation efforts.In conclusion, while concerns about the negative effects of international tourism exist, its positive contributions to economic development and cultural/environmental preservation cannot be overlooked. By promoting responsible tourism practices, we can ensure that the benefits outweigh the adverse effects, leading to a more sustainable relationship between tourists and destination countries."
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;International tourism has witnessed a dramatic surge over the past 50 years, with millions of travelers crossing borders to explore diverse cultures, landscapes, and experiences. This trend, while fostering global connectivity and economic growth, elicits varying opinions on its overall impact. In my view, while the benefits of international tourism are notable, it is crucial to implement conservation measures to protect invaluable cultural and natural resources.The exponential increase in international travel can be attributed to various factors, including advancements in transportation, globalization, and the rise of social media. These elements have made it easier for people to explore the world and share their experiences, thus fueling the desire to travel. Economically, tourism generates substantial revenue for many countries, creating job opportunities and promoting local businesses. This influx of visitors often leads to infrastructural developments, enhancing the overall quality of life for residents.However, this booming industry comes with a significant downside. Many popular tourist destinations are experiencing overwhelming pressure on their natural and cultural resources. Sites that once thrived in serenity are now overcrowded, leading to environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, and the commodification of unique cultural practices. If authorities do not take proactive measures to conserve these precious values, we risk losing the very essence that attracts tourists in the first place.To preserve these invaluable resources, it is imperative to develop sustainable tourism practices. Implementing regulations that limit visitor numbers at sensitive sites, promoting eco-tourism, and encouraging responsible travel behavior can contribute to the protection of cultural heritage and natural environments. Furthermore, investing in education and awareness campaigns can engage tourists in conservation efforts, ensuring that they understand the importance of preserving what they come to admire.In conclusion, while international tourism presents numerous benefits, it also poses challenges that must not be underestimated. By prioritizing conservation and sustainability, we can safeguard our planet's treasures for future generations, allowing tourism to flourish harmoniously with the environment and cultural richness.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;The prospect of studying overseas presents an exciting opportunity for many students. However, while some may argue that remaining in one's home country is preferable due to the difficulties associated with adapting to a different culture, I contend that the skills and experiences gained through international study far outweigh these challenges.Many students express reservations about studying abroad because of the potential difficulties they might encounter. Adapting to a new culture, language barriers, and homesickness can pose significant obstacles for those who venture abroad. Additionally, the financial implications of studying overseas can be daunting, as students must consider tuition fees, accommodation costs, and other living expenses in unfamiliar environments. These factors often lead students to prefer remaining closer to home where they can feel a sense of familiarity and support.However, in my opinion, studying overseas is a transformative experience that equips students with invaluable skills. Firstly, immersion in a different culture fosters adaptability and resilience. Students are forced to navigate new social norms and daily challenges, which significantly enhances their problem-solving abilities and independence. Secondly, exposure to diverse perspectives enriches one's worldview, encouraging open-mindedness and critical thinking. Engaging with peers from various backgrounds allows students to develop a global mindset, which is increasingly important in our interconnected world.Furthermore, studying abroad often provides opportunities for language acquisition, which is an essential asset in today’s job market. Being proficient in a second language opens doors to international career prospects and can set a candidate apart in competitive fields.In conclusion, although studying at home may seem like a safer option for some, the benefits of studying overseas—such as personal growth, cultural exposure, and professional advantages—are profound. By embracing the challenges of an international study experience, students not only gain academic knowledge but also develop life skills that will serve them well in their future endeavors.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;Studying abroad has become an increasingly popular choice among students worldwide, driven by a plethora of personal, academic, and cultural motivations. For many, the decision to attend schools or universities outside their home countries is a transformative experience that fosters extensive personal growth while offering a unique educational journey.One of the key reasons students choose to study abroad is the opportunity for personal development. Immersing oneself in a new environment cultivates a sense of flexibility and adaptability, essential traits that enhance resilience. Navigating everyday life in a foreign country - from language barriers to cultural differences - encourages students to step out of their comfort zones and confront challenges head-on. This newfound independence not only builds character but also significantly boosts confidence levels as students learn to navigate their surroundings and thrive in unfamiliar conditions.Academically, students benefit from exposure to diverse educational systems and methodologies. Universities outside their home countries often offer unique programs, leading-edge research opportunities, and esteemed faculty that may not be available at home. This exposure to international perspectives enhances critical thinking and broadens academic horizons, allowing students to acquire knowledge that transcends their local context. Moreover, studying abroad fosters collaboration with peers from various backgrounds, promoting a richer academic dialogue and exposing students to diverse ideas and approaches.Culturally, studying in a different country helps broaden students' worldviews. Engaging with local customs, traditions, and social norms enhances cultural competence, which is increasingly vital in our globalized world. Experiencing different lifestyles firsthand enables students to appreciate diversity, nurturing empathy and understanding crucial for future professional interactions.In conclusion, students who choose to study abroad embark on a multidimensional journey that enriches their lives personally, academically, and culturally. By developing adaptability, embracing new educational paradigms, and gaining cultural insights, they emerge as well-rounded global citizens equipped for success in an interconnected world.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The debate over the future of newspapers in the wake of the internet's rise is a compelling one, with opinions divided on whether traditional print media can coexist with digital platforms. While it is undeniable that the internet has become increasingly popular in recent years, offering a vast source of information at our fingertips, the fate of newspapers is not as clear-cut as it may seem.Advocates of digital media argue that the internet provides a quicker and more convenient means of obtaining information. News updates can be accessed almost instantaneously through various online platforms, encompassing a broad spectrum of topics. Users can easily navigate through countless articles, breaking news, and multimedia content, often free of charge. In contrast, newspapers tend to have a longer turnaround time for producing and disseminating news, which can make them seem outdated in the fast-paced digital age.However, there remains a belief among some that newspapers can sustain their relevance. Proponents of traditional print media argue that newspapers offer a tactile experience that digital formats cannot replicate. Many readers appreciate the depth of analysis, investigative journalism, and editorial integrity that established newspapers often provide. Furthermore, some demographics, particularly older generations, still prefer reading newspapers, viewing them as a trusted source of information.Despite these points, it is evident that newspapers face significant challenges in maintaining competitiveness. As online content becomes more sophisticated and user-friendly, the appeal of traditional newspapers diminishes. Financial struggles have already led to the closure of numerous publications, indicating a potential decline in traditional journalism. In conclusion, while newspapers may not entirely vanish in the near future, their role and influence are likely to continue diminishing as the internet remains the dominant source of information. The convenience and immediacy provided by digital media are hard to compete with, suggesting a inevitable shift in how society consumes news.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";Education is a cornerstone of civilization and plays a pivotal role in ensuring the long-term prosperity of a country. However, the allocation of government budgets towards education raises an important debate: should the focus be primarily on early childhood education rather than higher education institutions like universities? While some may argue that universities can sustain themselves through donations and innovations, this perspective overlooks the profound importance of investing in the foundational years of a child's education.Research consistently shows that the early years are critical for brain development, laying the groundwork for all future learning. By investing in young children's education, governments not only promote academic success but also foster social skills, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking. These attributes are essential for creating a civilized society, where individuals can participate effectively in democratic processes and contribute positively to their communities. Therefore, prioritizing early childhood education is not merely an investment in the individuals but in the collective future of the country.While universities play a vital role in creating a skilled workforce and driving innovation, they do not exist in isolation. A strong educational foundation enhances the quality of higher education. It is the early experiences that shape a student's curiosity and drive towards further education. Neglecting young children’s education in favor of prioritizing universities can lead to a cycle of educational disadvantage, whereby students enter higher education ill-equipped for success.Moreover, the argument that universities can fend for themselves through donations and commercial endeavors is flawed. Although some institutions may thrive this way, it is not universally applicable. Relying on external funding for a critical sector of education creates vulnerabilities that can lead to disparities in educational quality. In conclusion, while higher education is crucial, governments should devote more resources to early childhood education, as this lays the groundwork for a prosperous and civilized society. By striking a balance and ensuring that both levels of education are well-supported, countries can pave the way for a brighter, more equitable future.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";Living with roommates is a common experience for many students attending school or university. The dynamic of shared living spaces can significantly impact one's academic performance and personal well-being. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of a good roommate is being considerate. Additionally, effective communication plays a crucial role in fostering a harmonious environment.Being considerate involves being aware of and respectful towards each other's needs and preferences. For instance, a considerate roommate will take into account the other person's study schedule and avoid playing loud music during crucial times. This mutual respect is vital because it creates an atmosphere that allows both roommates to thrive academically. A personal example illustrates this point: my roommate and I developed a study routine where we respected each other’s quiet hours, which led to both of us achieving better grades and feeling less stressed.Moreover, effective communication is another essential quality that can make or break the roommate experience. Clear communication helps establish boundaries and expectations from the beginning. Discussing chores, privacy, and visitors can prevent misunderstandings that may lead to resentment. For instance, I once had a roommate who openly discussed her concerns about cleanliness. By addressing this early on, we agreed on a cleaning schedule that worked for both of us, ensuring our space remained tidy and minimized conflicts.In conclusion, the qualities of being considerate and communicative are fundamental for successful roommate relationships. A considerate roommate fosters a supportive atmosphere that benefits both individuals academically and personally, while effective communication paves the way for resolving conflicts. By prioritizing these qualities, students can create a living situation that enhances their educational journey.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;When it comes to enhancing transportation infrastructure, the debate between investing in roads and highways versus public transportation systems is crucial for the future of urban mobility. Governments should prioritize spending on public transportation, such as buses, trains, and subways, for several compelling reasons. First and foremost, improving public transportation helps alleviate traffic congestion, which has become a significant issue in urban areas. As populations grow, cities experience a dramatic increase in the number of vehicles on the road. This surge creates bottlenecks, resulting in longer commute times and increased frustration for daily travelers. By expanding and improving public transit infrastructures, such as building more subway lines or increasing the frequency of bus routes, governments can provide an efficient alternative to personal vehicles. This not only encourages more residents to use public transportation but also significantly reduces the number of cars clogging the streets.Furthermore, concentrating investments on public transportation can lead to a noticeable decrease in carbon emissions. Vehicles, including cars and motorbikes, are significant contributors to air pollution and climate change due to their high levels of fossil fuel consumption. In contrast, public transportation is generally more environmentally friendly, as it can move many passengers simultaneously, thereby lowering the carbon footprint per person. By promoting the use of buses, trains, and subways, governments can play a pivotal role in decreasing the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere, helping to protect the ozone layer and mitigate the adverse effects of global warming.In conclusion, governments should dedicate more resources to enhancing public transportation systems. The benefits of reducing traffic congestion and minimizing carbon emissions are vital not only for the well-being of individuals but also for the health of our planet. Transitioning towards a robust public transit network is indispensable for creating sustainable cities and addressing the pressing challenges of urbanization and climate change.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";"The debate surrounding the integration of physical exercise into the school curriculum is one that warrants careful consideration. I firmly believe that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. The link between regular physical activity and overall health is undeniable; the more we practice, the better we feel. Engaging in physical exercise not only enhances our physical condition but also contributes significantly to mental well-being. Students who incorporate exercise into their routine often exhibit reduced stress levels, better mood regulation, and improved focus in their academic studies.Furthermore, participating in both indoor and outdoor sports provides students with clear advantages beyond just fitness. Sports activities can foster teamwork, discipline, and resilience, valuable life skills that enhance personal development. Moreover, outdoor sports connect students with nature, leading to a greater appreciation for the environment and fostering a sense of community. These experiences can clarify students’ perspectives on collaboration and leadership, which are critical in various aspects of life.Additionally, the financial sustainability of a region is intrinsically linked to the health of its population. A physically active community is often a healthier one, leading to reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity. This economic perspective underscores the importance of promoting health and fitness through structured exercise programs in schools. By prioritizing physical education, we are not merely investing in the present health of our students but also in the future economic well-being of our communities.In conclusion, physical exercise should be an integral part of the school day. The benefits extend beyond individual health, fostering improved academic performance, personal growth, and the long-term financial sustainability of society. Encouraging a balanced approach to education, which includes physical activity, will yield positive outcomes for both students and their communities."
11;Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the telephone have changed the way that nations interact with each other in a global society. Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.;Technological advancements have significantly transformed the landscape of global interaction, with innovations like the airplane and telephone revolutionizing communication and travel. Among these advancements, email stands out as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Its impact on how nations interact cannot be overstated, particularly in education and healthcare, two fields that have far-reaching implications.Email has streamlined communication in a way that enhances global connectivity. For instance, students seeking admission to foreign universities can navigate the application process effortlessly, making education more accessible than ever before. Previously, students faced numerous barriers, including time zone differences and slow traditional mail systems. With email, applicants can now send and receive important documents, recommendations, and inquiries in real time. This ease of communication fosters diversity in educational institutions, allowing for a broader exchange of ideas and cultures.Moreover, email facilitates collaboration among biomedical engineers and researchers across the globe. This technology allows professionals to share critical findings and innovations in real-time, significantly influencing healthcare advancements. For example, through email, biomedical engineers can discuss research on life-extending technologies or cutting-edge treatments with peers worldwide, accelerating the pace of innovation. This collaboration has the potential to increase life expectancy globally, as breakthroughs are shared and implemented more effectively.In conclusion, email serves as a cornerstone of modern global interaction by enhancing educational opportunities and fostering international collaboration in healthcare. The efficiency of instant communication has empowered students and professionals alike, allowing them to transcend geographical barriers and work collectively towards common goals. As we continue to navigate an increasingly interconnected world, the role of email—and technology as a whole—will undoubtedly remain pivotal in shaping our global society.
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;The debate on whether technology has stifled the creativity of children is multifaceted, and I believe it is an oversimplification to claim that technology has unequivocally made children less creative than in the past. While it is true that technology may have some negative effects—increased screen time leading to diminished attention spans, for example—it also serves as a powerful catalyst for creativity and innovation.Critics argue that technology, particularly social media and video games, can distract children and limit their imagination. They point out that access to endless entertainment can lead to passive consumption rather than active creation. However, this viewpoint often overlooks the myriad of tools and platforms that technology offers for creative expression. Digital art software, coding programs, and platforms like YouTube or TikTok empower children to explore their artistic, musical, and storytelling capabilities in ways that were previously unimaginable. Technology encourages children to experiment with new forms of creativity, merging traditional art with digital innovation.Furthermore, technology broadens children's knowledge base in unprecedented ways. With the vast resources available online, children can access information on any subject, engage with global communities, and collaborate on projects with peers from different cultural backgrounds. This exposure fosters a rich environment where they can gather diverse ideas, learn from others, and translate that knowledge into their own creative pursuits. The internet provides a wellspring of inspiration, whether through tutorials, forums, or open-source collaboration.In conclusion, while it is important to acknowledge the potential downsides of technology, I argue that it indeed inspires creativity and expands the horizons of knowledge for children. Instead of viewing technology as a detractor, we should promote its potential as a facilitator of innovative thinking and creative expression in the younger generation.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;"In the debate surrounding the sources of learning for students in schools and universities, many argue that lessons with teachers are far more beneficial than learning from other platforms, such as the internet or television. I largely agree with this notion, as teachers play a critical role in shaping students' understanding of fundamental concepts and moral values.From the very early stages of education, teachers are instrumental in guiding young learners through essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. For instance, in kindergarten, students are introduced to the alphabet and basic mathematics through structured lessons led by experienced educators. This foundational knowledge is crucial and is often difficult to acquire independently through various media outlets. Teachers not only present knowledge in a coherent manner but also tailor their methods to accommodate diverse learning styles, which helps ensure that each student understands the material thoroughly.Moreover, teachers impart more than just academic knowledge; they also instill moral values and ethics. In a classroom setting, students learn to distinguish right from wrong through discussions led by teachers, fostering character development that is vital for their growth as responsible adults. Unlike the unfiltered information available on the internet, teachers can curate content and provide context, ensuring that students have a balanced perspective on sensitive issues.However, it is essential to acknowledge that resources such as the internet and television can complement traditional teaching methods. They offer additional avenues for research and exploration, enriching the students' learning experience. Yet, these sources cannot replace the personalized teaching and mentorship provided by educators.In conclusion, while alternative sources of information are valuable, the expertise and guidance of teachers remain paramount for effective learning in schools and universities. Their ability to nurture students’ academic and ethical foundations firmly establishes teachers’ lessons as the cornerstone of education."
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;Email and text messaging have undeniably transformed the landscape of communication, enabling instantaneous connection across vast distances. This technological revolution has become integral to both personal and professional interactions. However, the rise of these digital communication tools raises concerns about their potential impact on the status of written language. While some argue that these methods are diminishing the quality and sophistication of written communication, it is essential to consider a broader perspective regarding their implications and the responsibilities of users.On one hand, proponents of the notion that email and text messaging threaten written language often point to the rise of informal language, including abbreviations, acronyms, and even emojis. These innovations can lead to a decline in grammatical standards and vocabulary breadth, especially among younger generations who predominantly utilize these forms of communication. Their reliance on such informal registers may result in diminished writing skills and a decrease in their ability to effectively articulate ideas in formal contexts.On the other hand, it is crucial to recognize that language has always been fluid and adaptable. While email and text messaging may introduce a more casual style of writing, they also encourage creativity and brevity. Many individuals, particularly younger users, navigate the boundaries between formality and informality, demonstrating an awareness of context that can enrich their overall communication skills. This evolution does warrant attention from educators and society as a whole. By fostering discussions about language, grammar, and effective communication in both digital and traditional formats, educators can help ensure that students develop a strong foundation in written language while also adapting to modern communication methods. Ultimately, it is not the tools themselves that threaten the status of written language but rather how individuals choose to engage with them. Emphasizing the importance of adaptability and awareness can help safeguard the integrity of written language amid changing communication landscapes.
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";The debate surrounding the use of animals for human benefit is a contentious issue, with compelling arguments on both sides. Proponents of animal experimentation often contend that these practices lead to significant advancements in medicine and food production, benefiting human health and society. For instance, countless medical breakthroughs, from vaccines to life-saving drugs, have been developed through animal testing. According to the American Medical Association, 90% of medicines that pass animal tests fail in humans, highlighting the critical nature of such experiments in ensuring safety and efficacy. Without testing on animals, the risk of introducing dangerous substances to the market would dramatically increase, potentially leading to devastating public health crises.Conversely, opponents of animal testing argue that it is inherently cruel and inhumane. They emphasize the suffering inflicted on animals, advocating for a more ethical approach to science that respects all living beings. The images of animals subjected to invasive procedures elicit strong emotional responses, leading many to believe that the exploitation of animals cannot be justified, even for the sake of human welfare.However, I firmly believe that while the ethical concerns surrounding animal testing are valid, the benefits derived from such practices cannot be overlooked. No sensible person can deny that permitting untested foods and medicines on the market would pose a dramatically cruel risk not only to humans but also indirectly to animals, as an outbreak of undetected viruses or toxins can have wide-ranging ecological consequences. Therefore, while it is vital to minimize animal suffering and pursue alternatives wherever possible, the reality remains that animal testing plays a crucial role in safeguarding human health. It is essential to strike a balanced approach that incorporates humane practices in scientific research while acknowledging the undeniable contributions that animal testing has made to society.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;"Television has become an omnipresent force in modern society, dramatically shaping how we communicate. While some argue that it serves as an information bridge, I stand firmly in the belief that television has eroded meaningful communication among friends and family.One significant factor is that most people lack a structured approach to their television viewing. The absence of a plan often leads to binge-watching sessions, consuming countless hours that could otherwise be spent engaging meaningfully with loved ones. Instead of sharing stories over dinner or enjoying a group activity, families frequently find themselves isolated in front of the screen, absorbed in fictional narratives or reality shows. This is not merely an anecdotal observation; studies indicate that excessive television consumption correlates with a decline in interpersonal relationships, especially among family members.Moreover, the nature of television viewing fosters laziness. With the convenience of streaming platforms, viewers can sit for hours without moving, which diminishes opportunities for physical activity and social interaction. As such, leisure time, which could have been utilized for family board games, outings, or simple conversations, is instead surrendered to the television. Not only does this create a sedentary lifestyle, but it also reinforces a disconnect among people who are physically present but mentally absent, glued to what’s on screen.Additionally, many television programs glorify negative behaviors and lifestyles, including criminal activities. When friends and family gather to watch such content, they may unwittingly normalize these actions, undermining community values. The allure of sensationalism can strain relationships, as conversations shift from meaningful exchanges to discussing controversial scenes. This shift diminishes the quality of discourse and leads to misunderstandings and disagreements among loved ones.In conclusion, while television can offer entertainment, its propensity to disrupt communication among friends and family cannot be overlooked. The lack of schedule for viewing, the promotion of laziness, and the glorification of negative behaviors culminate in a profound gap in interpersonal connections. A balanced approach is necessary, encouraging selectivity in viewing choices and prioritizing face-to-face engagements to preserve the bonds that unite us."
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;The debate surrounding gender equality in university admissions has gained considerable attention in recent years. Advocates for equal numbers of male and female students in every subject argue that it is essential for fostering diversity and inclusivity in higher education. While I understand the importance of gender balance, I contend that universities should prioritize merit and individual potential over equal representation in terms of gender.Firstly, women have consistently demonstrated their capabilities and achievements across various fields, both indoors and outdoors. From science and technology to arts and humanities, women have broken numerous barriers and excelled in roles traditionally dominated by men. Their success serves as a testament to their abilities, reinforcing the notion that gender should not be an impediment to pursuing any subject.Secondly, the current job market plays a critical role in shaping the admissions policies of universities. Institutions often design their courses based on the needs and demands of employers. As certain fields experience gender imbalances—such as engineering and computer science attracting more males—universities may find it more beneficial to admit students based on their qualifications rather than striving for gender parity. Forcing equal numbers could lead to underqualified candidates being admitted simply based on their gender, ultimately compromising academic standards.Moreover, the focus should be on encouraging underrepresented genders in specific fields rather than imposing equal quotas. Initiatives such as scholarships for female students in STEM fields or mentorship programs can achieve greater gender balance without diminishing the importance of meritocracy in admissions.In conclusion, while the goal of achieving gender equality in education is commendable, universities should prioritize individual merit and the evolving needs of the job market. Emphasizing qualifications rather than strictly enforcing equal gender representation will foster an environment where all students can thrive based on their potential and aspirations.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;The transition from adolescence to adulthood brings significant choices, particularly regarding living arrangements. Some young adults eagerly pursue independence from their parents, while others prefer the comfort and security of family life. The decision impacts their lives profoundly, and while independence can be alluring, I argue that remaining at home for a longer duration may ultimately be a more beneficial choice.Many young adults yearn for the freedom that comes with living independently. They relish the idea of an unbounded lifestyle, free from parental restrictions and expectations. This desire for independence is often fueled by the thrill of making one's own choices, whether regarding social activities, daily routines, or financial spending. However, young adults frequently overlook the complexities and challenges accompanying such decisions. Moving out means not just newfound freedom, but also greater responsibility. They will face everyday adult challenges, ranging from budgeting to balancing work and personal life. Moreover, many young adults may not be prepared for the emotional strain that comes with managing life outside the safety net of their family home.On the other hand, living with family provides stability and support during a crucial life phase. By choosing to stay at home, young adults can save substantial amounts of money, avoiding disruptive financial stresses. They can focus on their education, career development, or even saving for future endeavors without the burden of rent and utility bills. Additionally, living at home allows for deeper family relationships during formative years, providing emotional nourishment and guidance.In conclusion, while the lure of independence is undeniably strong, the advantages of living with family far outweigh the desire for immediate freedom. Young adults who choose to stay at home can develop their skills for a more secure future, learning the value of responsibility while enjoying the emotional and financial safety that familial support offers.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;"Environmental degradation, especially air pollution, has emerged as a critical issue that demands immediate attention. Air pollution significantly contributes to various environmental problems, including the depletion of the ozone layer and exacerbating global warming. These phenomena not only threaten ecological balance but also pose grave risks to human health and future generations. Thus, the question arises: who bears the responsibility for cleaning up our environment? In my opinion, a balanced approach that involves both government regulations and private accountability is essential for effectively addressing air pollution.While it is often argued that government intervention is crucial, especially in enacting legislation to limit harmful emissions, the responsibilities also extend to individuals and companies. Private sector players should be held accountable for their contributions to air pollution. For instance, companies should be mandated to invest in cleaner technologies and bear the financial responsibility for pollution remediation. Private individuals also play a vital role; simple actions such as reducing car usage, opting for public transport, and minimizing waste can collectively lead to significant reductions in pollution levels.Conversely, governments need to implement strict regulations regarding the use of products that are significant contributors to air pollution. Restrictions on emissions from industries, as well as incentivizing sustainable practices, are necessary measures. By imposing environmental standards, governments can guide both individuals and corporations towards more eco-friendly choices.In conclusion, while the government certainly has a critical role in establishing regulations and standards, the responsibility for cleaning up the environment should not rest solely on their shoulders. Companies and private individuals must also be proactive in minimizing their environmental footprint. Only through a collaborative effort can we hope to address the pressing issue of air pollution and pave the way for a more sustainable future."
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;Advertising plays a pivotal role in driving sales and shaping consumer perceptions in today's competitive marketplace. It is widely acknowledged that well-crafted advertising strategies are among the most effective means to influence purchasing decisions. Engaging advertisements can capture attention, communicate product benefits, and create an emotional connection between the brand and the consumer. A compelling advertisement can intrigue potential buyers, sparking interest in a product that they may have otherwise overlooked.However, while advertising is crucial, it is not solely sufficient to guarantee high sales. A product must meet or exceed consumer expectations to ensure satisfaction and encourage repeat purchases. If a product fails to deliver on its promises or does not fulfill a genuine need, even the most compelling advertising campaign will likely falter in generating lasting success. For instance, a tech gadget may be heavily promoted, but if it is prone to malfunctions or does not provide value, consumers will quickly abandon it in favor of competitors that offer superior quality.Moreover, modern consumers are more discerning than ever, often conducting extensive research before making a purchase. Social media and online reviews have empowered consumers to share their opinions on the effectiveness and quality of products, leading to a scenario where advertising alone can no longer guarantee sales. Therefore, businesses must strike a balance between effective advertising and product excellence to build a loyal customer base.In conclusion, while high sales can indeed be attributed to powerful advertising strategies, the effectiveness of these strategies is contingent upon the inherent quality and utility of the product being marketed. A product must not only be well-promoted but also genuinely satisfy consumer needs to achieve sustainable sales success.
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";The debate surrounding the value of a high percentage of young people attending university is multifaceted, with convincing arguments on both sides. In this essay, I will analyze both views in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.Those who advocate against the impracticability of university education argue that flooding the job market with graduates can lead to unemployment and underemployment. They contend that while many young people earn degrees, the market saturation of specific fields creates a mismatch between available jobs and graduates' skills. For example, fields like humanities and sociology often result in high graduation rates, but the corresponding job opportunities may not be sufficient. This phenomenon not only leads to increased competition for limited roles but can also leave many graduates disillusioned and burdened by student debt without corresponding career prospects.On the other side of the coin are voices in opposition, emphasizing that universities provide essential skills for careers as well as crucial academic knowledge. Graduates are often equipped with critical thinking abilities, communication skills, and specialized knowledge that enhance workplace productivity and innovation. Higher education institutions also serve as breeding grounds for new ideas and research that can boost economic growth and social progress. Countries with a high percentage of university-educated individuals tend to enjoy greater social mobility and lower rates of poverty, as education can act as a powerful equalizer.In my opinion, the benefits of having a well-educated youth population outweigh the potential drawbacks. Although unemployment issues do need addressing, the overall advantages of fostering intellectual growth, innovation, and competitiveness in a global economy are paramount. Therefore, nations should not shy away from encouraging university attendance but rather focus on aligning educational curricula with market needs to better prepare graduates for their future careers. This balanced approach may mitigate risks of unemployment while still maximizing the socio-economic advantages of a highly educated populace.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;"Mobile phones have become an integral part of our lives, bringing tremendous convenience by keeping us connected, informed, and entertained. However, this popularity has also ushered in a plethora of social, medical, and technical problems that cannot be ignored. In this essay, I will explore these issues to ascertain whether the drawbacks of mobile phone usage outweigh the benefits.Socially, mobile phones have transformed communication but also fostered negative behaviors. For instance, speaking loudly on the phone in public places, such as schools, libraries, and hospitals, is increasingly common yet highly offensive to those around us. This disregard for social etiquette has strained interpersonal interactions and fostered a culture of impatience. Furthermore, the rise of smartphones has made cheating in exams easier; students often use their devices as discreet tools for obtaining answers, undermining academic integrity.Medically, the effects of mobile phone usage are concerning. The prolonged use of phones can lead to various health issues, such as eye strain, sleep disorders, and repetitive strain injuries. Studies have also suggested links between excessive mobile usage and anxiety or depression, indicating that these devices can significantly impact mental well-being.Technically, mobile phones are not without faults. Issues such as malware, data breaches, and privacy concerns have emerged as we increasingly rely on them for everyday tasks. Moreover, the dependence on these devices has raised questions about digital addiction and the overarching impact on our cognitive abilities and social skills.In conclusion, while mobile phones undeniably offer convenience and enhance connectivity, the accompanying social, medical, and technical problems present a worrying trend. The implications of disruptive behavior in public spaces, the facilitation of academic dishonesty, and adverse health effects suggest that the problems associated with mobile phone usage indeed outweigh the benefits. A more cautious approach to mobile phone usage is essential to mitigate these issues and foster a healthier relationship with technology."
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;The debate surrounding the daily use of computers by children is a contentious one, with passionate arguments on both sides. Proponents assert that computers can be highly beneficial for children, providing access to vast amounts of information, facilitating online learning, and enabling creative expression through various digital platforms. They believe that in our increasingly digital world, familiarity with computers is essential for children to thrive academically and socially. However, I find the arguments against daily computer use to be more compelling, primarily due to its negative effects on children's health and social skills.One of the most concerning aspects of daily computer use is its impact on children’s eyesight. Spending extended hours staring at screens can lead to a range of vision problems, including digital eye strain, headaches, and long-term issues such as myopia. As children become more reliant on computers for their education and entertainment, the risk of these eye-related problems escalates, potentially leading to lifelong consequences. The importance of maintaining proper eye health cannot be overstated, particularly in a time when screens dominate our daily lives.Furthermore, excessive time spent on computers, especially for gaming, can significantly impair children's communication skills. Engaging in virtual interactions fails to replace the richness of face-to-face communication, which includes non-verbal cues, empathy, and social nuance. Children who immerse themselves in online gaming often neglect real-world interactions, leading to diminished social skills and relationships. As they struggle to navigate social contexts, they may experience difficulties in forming friendships and collaborative bonds.In conclusion, while computers offer certain educational benefits, I firmly believe that their daily use can have more negative than positive effects on children. The health risks associated with prolonged computer use, alongside the detrimental impact on communication skills, underscore the need for a balanced approach. It is essential to set limits on computer time and encourage children to engage in a variety of activities that promote both well-being and interpersonal skills.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;The establishment of a large factory near our community has sparked significant debate regarding its potential advantages and disadvantages. While critics often express concerns about environmental degradation and local disruptions, I believe that the benefits of such an industrial development can outweigh the negatives, especially if we actively address the environmental challenges it presents.Firstly, one of the most compelling advantages of a large factory is its ability to stimulate local economic growth. Factories can create numerous job opportunities, significantly reducing the unemployment rate in the community. This influx of employment not only supports families but can also enhance the overall standard of living. With more jobs available, the community can see an increase in disposable income, leading to greater spending in local businesses and heightened economic activity. Additionally, the factory may attract ancillary businesses, such as suppliers and distributors, further diversifying the local economy.However, the introduction of a large factory is not without its drawbacks. Environmental concerns often take center stage, as such establishments can contribute to air and water pollution, noise, and increased traffic congestion. Nevertheless, these issues can be mitigated through rigorous regulation and investment in sustainable practices. By incorporating green technologies and environmentally friendly processes, factories can minimize their ecological footprint. If the community works collaboratively with factory management to enforce regulations and promote sustainability initiatives, it is possible to coexist harmoniously.Moreover, as our society progresses, the construction of more factories may become inevitable in our quest for economic advancement. Thus, it becomes essential to embrace this development wisely. While we should remain vigilant about the accompanying challenges, a proactive approach focused on environmental responsibility can turn a potential liability into a tremendous asset. Ultimately, by fostering a balance between industrial growth and environmental stewardship, we can ensure that the large factory serves as a catalyst for prosperity rather than a hindrance to our community’s well-being.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;The advent of convenience food has undoubtedly transformed the culinary landscape, making meal preparation quicker and easier than ever before. However, this trend invites a critical examination of its impact on our health and culinary skills. While prepared food offers undeniable convenience, it carries several negative consequences that warrant concern.Firstly, many prepared foods are laden with artificial ingredients, preservatives, and additives. These substances can pose various health risks when consumed in excess, such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. The use of such ingredients often overshadows the nutritional value of the food, which typically relies on whole, fresh ingredients rich in vitamins and minerals. With the fast-paced nature of modern life, many individuals opt for these processed options, neglecting the importance of nutrition in their diets.Furthermore, the increasing reliance on prepared foods modifies our eating habits and diminishes the appreciation for home-cooked meals. As individuals become accustomed to simply heating packaged meals, they may lose motivation to explore cooking and experimenting with fresh ingredients. This shift not only undermines the efficacy of culinary skills but also detracts from the cultural significance of communal meals, where cooking becomes a medium for creativity and bonding.As we indulge in the ease of prepared meals, we risk losing fundamental cooking techniques that have been passed down through generations. The art of meal preparation fosters a connection to one’s heritage and provides a sense of accomplishment. Additionally, a lack of cooking skills may perpetuate a cycle of dependency on convenience foods, which can further exacerbate public health issues.In conclusion, while food preparation has become easier with the availability of prepared meals, this trend is not without its drawbacks. The reliance on artificial ingredients and the erosion of cooking skills highlight the need to strike a balance between convenience and health. Prioritizing nutrition and the joy of cooking can lead to a more fulfilling and healthier relationship with food.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;"The notion that financial aid is the singularly effective means of assisting developing countries is a contentious assertion. While it is undeniable that financial assistance plays a vital role in alleviating poverty and addressing immediate needs, it is short-sighted to consider it the only viable solution. Developed nations and organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, have long recognized the necessity of providing financial aid to impoverished countries. This support enables immediate resource distribution for essential services like healthcare and education. For instance, countries like India and Ethiopia have benefited from foreign aid that has helped improve their educational infrastructure, thereby addressing some of the root causes of poverty.However, it is crucial to analyze the real objectives of these financial supporters. Often, financial assistance comes with strings attached, such as economic reform measures or political conditions that may not align with the interests or needs of the recipient country. In some cases, this has fostered a cycle of dependency rather than facilitating sustainable development. Moreover, the adage ""there is no free lunch"" highlights that financial aid can sometimes serve the interests of donors more than the recipients. By offering funds, developed countries may seek to gain influence or access to resources rather than genuinely fostering the development of local economies. This has raised questions about the effectiveness of financial aid in creating long-term, meaningful change.In conclusion, while financial aid is undoubtedly important for developing countries, it should not be viewed as the only solution. A multifaceted approach that includes investment in education, infrastructure development, and the promotion of self-sufficiency is essential for fostering sustainable development. Only through a combination of different strategies can we hope to make a lasting impact on the lives of people in developing countries."
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;The debate surrounding the necessity and ethical implications of advertising is a complex one, invoking strong opinions on both sides. While it is essential to recognize the negative impact of certain types of advertisements, such as those promoting alcohol, cigarettes, or adult content, calling for a complete ban on advertising overlooks its significant purpose in society. Firstly, advertisements that promote harmful products can undoubtedly exert a detrimental influence, especially on impressionable children. Research indicates that exposure to alcohol and tobacco advertisements increases the likelihood of youth experimentation with these substances. Similarly, adult content advertisements can distort children's understanding of relationships and sexuality, leading to unrealistic expectations and misconceptions. Therefore, it is reasonable to argue for the prohibition of advertising certain products, particularly those that can harm minors or contribute to societal issues like addiction and unhealthy behaviors.However, dismissing advertising entirely would undermine the economic and informational function that it serves. Businesses, from small startups to multinational corporations, rely on advertising to promote their goods and services. It enables them to compete in a saturated marketplace, encouraging innovation and choice for consumers. Moreover, advertising plays a crucial role in supporting various sectors, including the arts, entertainment, and even public services, through funding and visibility.Furthermore, governments also depend on advertising as a means to communicate important public health messages, promote social programs, and foster civic engagement. When deployed responsibly, advertising can raise awareness about critical issues like health, safety, and environmental conservation.In conclusion, while certain forms of advertising should be prohibited due to their potential to harm children and societal well-being, a blanket ban on all advertising is neither feasible nor justified. Instead, a more balanced approach that regulates harmful content while allowing for creative and informative advertising can be a constructive way forward.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;In contemporary society, the opportunities available to women have expanded significantly compared to previous generations. The shift toward gender equality has largely dismantled employment discrimination, allowing women to participate in the workforce on equal footing with men. This crucial advancement raises an essential question about the roles of women in the modern context: should married women focus on careers or remain primarily responsible for household duties?I firmly believe that women should embrace their right to work, not only for financial reasons but also for personal and societal growth. When married women take up jobs, they can contribute to the family income, alleviating financial pressures and enhancing their family's living standards. This economic empowerment is vital as it encourages families to thrive rather than merely survive.Additionally, working outside the home offers married women the opportunity to engage with the broader world. It helps in developing their skills, fostering independence, and reinforcing their self-esteem. These experiences can significantly strengthen their character, allowing them to build valuable connections and networks beyond their households. As they navigate professional challenges, they also demonstrate resilience and adaptability, characteristics that serve as powerful life lessons for their children.Moreover, when mothers model a strong work ethic, they instill in their children the value of perseverance and ambition. Daughters can grow up understanding that they can pursue their aspirations, while sons learn to appreciate the contributions of women in all spheres. This dynamic fosters a more equitable view of gender roles, facilitating a culture where contributions are valued regardless of gender.In conclusion, women should not be confined to household responsibilities in today's evolving landscape. By entering the workforce, married women not only support their families financially but also inspire future generations, cultivating a more equal and progressive society.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";Education is a fundamental right and plays a crucial role in the development of individuals and society as a whole. It is widely accepted that the government should provide primary and secondary education to all citizens, ensuring that every child has access to basic literacy and numeracy skills. This foundation is essential for fostering an informed and skilled populace. However, when it comes to higher education, such as university, the question arises: should the government continue to fund this level of education, or should the burden be placed on students and their families?On one hand, requiring students or their parents to pay for university education acknowledges the higher costs and resources involved in tertiary programs. It is reasonable to expect individuals to invest in their education, especially when a degree can lead to better job prospects and higher earning potential. This approach can also motivate students to value their education more, fostering a sense of responsibility towards their learning.However, the financial constraints faced by many families cannot be overlooked. Not all parents have the means to support their children's university aspirations, which can lead to a widening gap in educational attainment based on socio-economic background. Without financial support, bright and capable students may be deprived of their chance to pursue higher education, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.Moreover, it is crucial to consider the financial burden already placed on governments, which already invest substantial amounts in primary and secondary education. While it is understandable for governments to seek to limit expenditures, completely shifting the cost of university education onto students could be counterproductive. A balanced approach, potentially combining government subsidies, scholarships, and student loans, could provide an equitable solution that allows for access to higher education without overburdening families or the government.In conclusion, while I agree that the government should focus on primary and secondary education, I believe a collaborative approach is necessary for university education. This ensures that all students have the opportunity to pursue their academic goals, regardless of their financial background.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;The evolution of transportation in Britain has seen the transition from the first automobile on the roads in 1888 to a predicted 29 million vehicles by the year 2000. This dramatic increase in car ownership highlights the need for a reevaluation of our transport systems, particularly in light of the growing environmental concerns associated with automobiles. A great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation, spurring debate about the merits of cars compared to alternative forms of transport.Proponents of automobiles argue that they offer unparalleled convenience—enabling individuals to travel at their own pace and access remote locations. Cars provide a sense of freedom and flexibility that cannot be easily replicated by public transit. However, this convenience comes at a significant cost. The rise in vehicle usage has led to increased air pollution, congestion, and greenhouse gas emissions, spurring calls for more sustainable transport options.On the other hand, many assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered, as they present viable solutions to the challenges posed by excessive car dependency. Bicycles and public transport systems, such as buses and trains, can reduce environmental impact, ease traffic congestion, and promote healthier lifestyles. Cities that have invested in cycling infrastructure and robust public transport networks often see improved air quality and reduced urban congestion.In light of these arguments, it is evident that a balanced approach is essential. Encouraging alternative transport options while maintaining sensible regulations for car ownership could promote environmental sustainability and create healthier urban living conditions. Furthermore, the introduction of international laws to control car ownership could provide a cohesive strategy for reducing the environmental burden associated with personal vehicles. In conclusion, while the convenience of automobiles cannot be denied, it is imperative that we prioritize alternative transport methods to safeguard our environment and promote sustainable futures.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";The debate surrounding whether rich countries should provide financial assistance to poorer nations is multifaceted. However, I firmly believe that the positive effects of aiding impoverished countries significantly outweigh any potential negative consequences. Firstly, many poor countries face severe shortages of basic materials and facilities that are essential for starting and sustaining businesses. This lack of resources stifles entrepreneurship and economic growth, preventing these nations from climbing out of poverty. Financial assistance can serve as a catalyst for development by allowing these countries to invest in infrastructure, education, and health care. When these foundational elements are nurtured, there is a better probability of economic stability and growth, which can lead to self-sufficiency in the long run.Secondly, providing aid can foster a deeper understanding of the struggles faced by the disadvantaged populations in poor countries. When wealthier nations extend their support, it signifies a willingness to engage with the global community on issues that affect humanity at large. Such campaigns often highlight the plight of poor people and can lead to increased awareness and empathy, which are crucial for creating a more equitable world. This understanding can also drive policy changes within the donor countries, encouraging them to consider the global implications of their domestic and foreign policies.Furthermore, many aid campaigns are designed to yield practical benefits beyond mere financial support. They often include training programs and knowledge transfer initiatives that empower communities with the skills necessary for sustainable development. This holistic approach not only addresses immediate financial needs but also equips individuals with the tools to improve their livelihoods, thus fostering long-term economic health.In conclusion, the provision of financial aid from rich countries to poorer nations has significant positive effects, aiding in the development of essential resources, increasing global awareness of poverty, and promoting practical benefits for communities. These factors make a compelling case for continued and increased support to help create a more just and prosperous world.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";Globalization is often viewed as a double-edged sword, wielding both benefits and drawbacks in its wake. On one side, proponents argue that it spurs economic growth, enhances cultural exchange, and fosters international cooperation. However, the negative aspects of globalization—especially its impact on ethnic and religious values—cannot be disregarded. I believe that while globalization contributes significantly to global improvement, it also poses serious threats to the unique identities of different cultures.Indeed, many people perceive globalization as an encroachment on their traditional values and practices. The rapid dissemination of Western culture often leads to a homogenization of lifestyles, where local customs and beliefs are overshadowed by global trends. This phenomenon can particularly threaten ethnic minorities and marginalized religious groups, eroding centuries of cultural heritage in favor of a more consumerist and uniform global culture. For instance, the proliferation of multinational corporations may not only eclipse local businesses but also dilute distinct culinary practices, languages, and art forms.Conversely, globalization undeniably enhances economic interconnectivity. Nations benefit from shared knowledge, increased trade opportunities, and access to diverse markets. As businesses and economies become intertwined, global challenges—such as climate change and poverty—demand collaborative solutions. Furthermore, globalization encourages cultural awareness and acceptance by exposing people to different ideologies and traditions. This exchange can promote tolerance and understanding, facilitating peaceful coexistence among diverse populations.In conclusion, while it is essential to celebrate the economic and social advancements brought by globalization, we must remain cognizant of its potential to threaten the fundamental values that define individual identities. A balanced approach that honors and preserves local cultures, while embracing the global community, is necessary to ensure a harmonious coexistence. Ultimately, recognizing both the strengths and vulnerabilities of globalization is essential for crafting a more inclusive world.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The debate surrounding whether children should be allowed to leave school early to pursue employment resonates deeply in today’s educational discourse. While some argue that children should be granted the opportunity to leave school and find jobs if they find certain subjects irrelevant, I firmly believe that students should be encouraged to complete their education, regardless of the perceived value of the subjects being taught.One compelling reason for maintaining a structured education is that it lays a foundation for lifelong learning. Knowledge gained in subjects like mathematics, science, and literature often extends beyond the classroom, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. For instance, the analytical skills developed in a math class could benefit a student in various future careers, even if they initially perceive math as irrelevant. Furthermore, the broader educational experience encourages diversity of thought and provides exposure to different perspectives, which is invaluable in our interconnected world.Conversely, the assertion that some children disrupt their peers’ educational experience warrants consideration. Yet, rather than allowing disengaged students to exit the system prematurely, the focus should be on finding ways to engage these students. Tailored teaching methods, mentorship, and vocational courses could provide meaningful alternatives, keeping students in school while catering to their unique interests and skills.In conclusion, while it is essential to acknowledge the frustrations of disengaged students, the role of education extends far beyond immediate utility. By emphasizing the importance of a well-rounded education, we prepare children for a future they may not yet envision. Encouraging persistence in education, rather than early exits, ultimately nurtures not only individual growth but also the collective well-being of society.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;"The influence of advertising on consumer behavior has sparked a contentious debate regarding its role in society. Some individuals argue that the high sales of popular consumer goods primarily reflect the power of advertising rather than the genuine needs of the public. While it is undeniable that advertisements often promote unnecessary products, it is essential to recognize their multifaceted impact on the economy and consumer choices.Admittedly, advertisements can sometimes be misleading, presenting exaggerated claims that entice consumers to purchase items that might be superfluous. This phenomenon leads to a culture of consumerism where individuals buy products that present well in marketing campaigns but serve little practical purpose in their lives. For instance, many beauty products are marketed with the promise of achieving an unrealistic ideal that is rarely attainable, compelling consumers to chase after the latest trends rather than focusing on their actual needs.However, it would be an oversight to dismiss the positive roles that advertising plays in the economy. Advertisements serve as a crucial vehicle for introducing new products to the market, allowing consumers to make informed choices about their purchases. By showcasing advancements and innovations, advertising facilitates competition, which can lead to improved quality and lower prices. Furthermore, advertisements are not only informative but often visually appealing, utilizing creativity and artistry to engage audiences.In conclusion, while it is true that advertising can lead to the consumption of unnecessary products, it is equally important to acknowledge its benefits. Advertising stimulates economic growth, educates consumers about new options, and provides a platform for creativity. Thus, I contend that the high sales figures of consumer goods cannot be solely attributed to advertising; instead, they reflect a complex interplay between marketing strategies and the evolving needs and preferences of society."
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;The ownership of guns is a contentious issue in societies worldwide. Unlike ordinary consumer goods, guns are not a conventional product that can be freely owned without consequences. Their potential for destruction necessitates strict regulations to ensure public safety. I firmly believe that limiting gun ownership is not only sensible but essential, particularly in light of rising accident rates, violent crime rates, and suicide rates.First and foremost, gun accidents pose a significant risk, particularly to children. According to studies, unintentional shootings account for a notable percentage of firearm deaths among youth. Firearms, when mismanaged or improperly stored, can lead to devastating consequences, including fatalities that could have otherwise been prevented. By imposing strict regulations on gun ownership, we can minimize the likelihood of such accidents, ensuring that firearms do not fall into the hands of those unqualified to handle them.Moreover, the correlation between gun ownership rates and violent crime rates cannot be overlooked. In regions where gun ownership is high, there tends to be an increase in gun-related homicides and assaults. Easy access to firearms can escalate conflicts, transforming altercations into deadly encounters. Limiting gun ownership could lead to a reduction in violent crimes, fostering a safer environment for all citizens.Lastly, the rise in suicide rates linked to gun access is a grim testament to the need for gun control. Research indicates that access to a firearm significantly increases the likelihood of suicide. By restricting gun ownership, particularly among at-risk populations, we can protect vulnerable individuals from impulsive decisions that could lead to irreversible consequences.In conclusion, the need for stringent gun control is clear. Unlike normal goods, firearms carry an inherent risk that necessitates careful management. By limiting gun ownership, we can address rising accident rates, violent crime, and suicide, ultimately creating a safer society for all. The value of preserving human life should supersede the desire for unrestricted access to firearms.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;International sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup or the Olympics, play a significant role in easing international tensions and providing a platform for individuals to express their patriotic sentiments safely. These occasions offer a unique spectacle that transcends cultural and political boundaries, fostering a sense of unity among nations while also allowing for healthy competition. Firstly, these events create an environment where rivalry manifests in a positive manner. Unlike political confrontations, where disagreements can escalate into hostility, sports provide a controlled context for nations to showcase their prowess. The World Cup, for example, engenders national pride as citizens rally behind their teams, offering a communal experience that can diminish feelings of animosity between rival nations. The camaraderie witnessed among supporters fosters mutual respect, where differences can be set aside in the spirit of friendly competition.Additionally, international sporting events offer a safe avenue for the expression of patriotism. Fans often engage in celebrations that express their national identity, such as wearing team jerseys, singing anthems, and waving flags. This collective expression of pride allows individuals to channel their emotions constructively rather than destructively, minimizing the potential for conflict. Specifically, the shared experience of celebrating a victory or mourning a loss can strengthen bonds among fans, creating a sense of international community.Furthermore, these events facilitate cross-cultural interactions, where fans from diverse backgrounds converge, share experiences, and promote understanding. Such interactions can challenge stereotypes and break down barriers, fostering a more interconnected world.In conclusion, international sporting events are essential in easing international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions. They promote unity, celebrate diversity, and facilitate respectful engagement between nations, making them indispensable in our increasingly interconnected society. The spirit of sports transcends geopolitical divisions, offering hope for peace and cooperation among countries.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;The impact of technology on economic disparities has sparked much debate, with opinions divided on whether it exacerbates the divide between the wealthy and the impoverished or helps bridge that gap. While some argue that advancements in technology have a detrimental effect on wealth inequality, I find it challenging to fully agree with this perspective based on several compelling reasons.Firstly, the rapid progress of material technology has led to a dramatic decrease in the prices of numerous goods and services. Accessible technological innovations, such as smartphones, computers, and household appliances, have made it possible for individuals from various economic backgrounds to participate in the digital economy. For example, online platforms allow small businesses to reach a global market, leveling the playing field for entrepreneurs who might not have the capital to compete with larger corporations. This democratization of access to technology has enabled many from less privileged backgrounds to improve their living standards significantly.Secondly, technological advancements have greatly enhanced productivity, enabling individuals to escape mundane daily chores and allocate their time towards more meaningful pursuits. Automation and artificial intelligence free workers from repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on creative and intellectually fulfilling activities. This shift has the potential to empower individuals to enhance their skills and pursue education, ultimately contributing to upward mobility.In contrast, it is essential to acknowledge the concerns surrounding access to technology, as not everyone may be able to afford the latest devices or high-speed internet. However, initiatives aimed at increasing digital literacy and access to technology in underserved communities demonstrate a commitment to bridging this gap.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding technology's impact on economic disparity, I believe it largely offers opportunities for enrichment and empowerment. The decreasing costs and increased productivity associated with technological advancements can help mitigate wealth inequality and support a more equitable society.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;"The debate surrounding government investments in space exploration has been a contentious one, with many perceiving such expenditures as extravagant or wasteful. However, I argue that investing in outer space is not only reasonable but essential for the advancement of human knowledge, technology, and environmental stewardship.Critics often contend that the billions spent on space missions could be better allocated to pressing terrestrial issues such as poverty, healthcare, or education. While these concerns are undeniably valid, it is crucial to recognize the significant benefits derived from space exploration that can indirectly address these very challenges. For instance, the technological advancements fostered by space programs often lead to innovations that improve life on Earth. Technologies developed for space missions, including satellite communications, GPS, and weather forecasting, have become integral to daily life and economic development.Moreover, observing Earth from outer space provides invaluable insights into our planet’s atmosphere and climate systems. Satellite imagery has proven essential in understanding weather patterns, tracking natural disasters, and monitoring environmental changes such as deforestation and ice melt. These observations are not merely scientific curiosities; they are crucial for developing strategies to combat climate change and protect our planet's ecosystems.Additionally, the visual representation of Earth as a spherical body, as seen from space, has historical significance. The iconic ""Earthrise"" photograph taken during the Apollo missions not only changed perceptions of our planet but galvanized a global movement towards environmental awareness and conservation. In conclusion, while the costs of space exploration may seem daunting, the return on investment, manifested through technological advancements, environmental understanding, and a broader perspective of our planet, substantiates the importance of these endeavors. Rather than viewing space travel as a frivolous expenditure, we should embrace it as a pathway to a more informed and sustainable future."
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;In the contemporary world, many teenagers begin taking on jobs as early as their university years. This trend has sparked a significant discussion regarding the implications of working while studying. While there are concerns about the potential negative effects on academic performance and personal well-being, I assert that the advantages of taking on extra jobs largely outweigh the disadvantages.One primary benefit of teenagers working while still in school is the practical experience they gain. Engaging in part-time employment allows students to apply theoretical knowledge from their courses in real-world scenarios. For instance, a business major working in a retail environment can learn about customer service, inventory management, and financial transactions, equipping them with skills that are invaluable in their future careers. This experience not only enhances their resumes but can also clarify career goals, allowing students to make informed choices about their professional paths.Moreover, balancing work and study cultivates essential life skills, such as time management, responsibility, and financial literacy. Students must learn to juggle their academic obligations with job responsibilities, which teaches them how to prioritize tasks and manage their time effectively. Additionally, earning an income can instill a sense of financial independence and responsibility, empowering students to save for tuition, personal expenses, or even future investments.While it is true that balancing work and school can lead to stress and fatigue, students who successfully manage these dual roles often emerge more resilient. They develop a strong work ethic and adaptability that can benefit them in both their academic pursuits and future careers.In conclusion, the positive aspects of teenagers working while they are still students far exceed the negative consequences. Practical experience, essential life skills, and financial independence are crucial benefits that prepare young people for the challenges of adulthood. Therefore, I believe that it is a good idea for teenagers to engage in jobs, as it significantly contributes to their personal and professional development.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;In recent years, an increasing number of educational institutions have adopted a practice of sending students to organizations for short-term unpaid work placements. This trend has sparked considerable debate regarding the benefits derived by both students and the organizations involved. The purpose of this essay is to explore these advantages in greater detail.For students, engaging in unpaid work placements provides invaluable real-world experience that enhances their learning. Firstly, such opportunities allow students to apply theoretical knowledge acquired in the classroom to practical scenarios, thereby solidifying their understanding. Through hands-on experiences, they can develop essential skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are vital in today's competitive job market. Additionally, working in a professional environment helps students build a network of contacts, paving the way for future employment opportunities. Exposure to workplace dynamics and organizational culture also equips them with a clearer understanding of their career aspirations.On the other hand, organizations benefit from hosting unpaid interns in several significant ways. Primarily, these interns can contribute to a range of projects without the associated labor costs. This arrangement enables companies to allocate resources more effectively while obtaining support in various tasks, potentially enhancing productivity. Furthermore, engaging with interns allows organizations to cultivate fresh perspectives and innovative ideas that can lead to improved processes or services. By mentoring students, they also fulfill a social responsibility, contributing to the educational growth of the next generation while showcasing their commitment to community engagement.In conclusion, sending students to organizations for unpaid work placements serves a dual purpose. It equips students with practical skills and experience while offering organizations valuable assistance and the opportunity to engage with future talent. Ultimately, this symbiotic relationship fosters personal and professional growth for both parties, making the practice significantly beneficial in the contemporary educational landscape.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;In the contemporary workplace, the relationship between employee motivation and productivity has become a topic of considerable debate. Some argue that financial incentives, such as pay raises or promotions, are the only effective means to enhance employee performance. While it is undeniable that increased compensation can significantly elevate morale, I contend that it is not the sole mechanism through which motivation and productivity can be achieved.Firstly, higher salaries and promotions can undoubtedly boost employee morale. When individuals feel their work is valued financially, it fosters a sense of satisfaction and loyalty toward their employer. This increase in morale can lead to enhanced productivity as employees are likely to feel more invested in their roles. For instance, bonuses for achieving targets or salary increments provide immediate gratification and recognition for hard work, motivating employees to maintain or increase their performance levels.However, relying solely on monetary incentives may overlook the complexities of human motivation. Numerous studies indicate that intrinsic motivation—stemming from the enjoyment and fulfillment derived from the work itself—plays a crucial role in driving productivity. Factors such as a positive work environment, opportunities for professional development, and a sense of purpose in one's job can inspire employees just as much, if not more, than financial rewards.Moreover, fostering strong interpersonal relationships between employees and management is vital. Supportive leadership, recognition of effort, and constructive feedback can create a culture where employees feel valued beyond their salaries. As a result, they are more likely to go above and beyond in their roles.In conclusion, while increasing salaries and promotions certainly enhance morale and can effectively motivate employees, it is simplistic to assert that financial incentives are the only solution for boosting productivity. A holistic approach that includes intrinsic motivators, positive work culture, and strong interpersonal relationships is essential for fostering a truly engaged and productive workforce.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;International sporting events, such as the football World Cup, play a crucial role in easing tensions between nations while providing a platform for patriotic expression in a safe and constructive manner. I firmly agree that these large-scale competitions redirect attention from geopolitical disputes to the excitement of competitive sports, fostering unity and national pride.Firstly, major sports events create a neutral ground where individuals from diverse backgrounds come together, transcending cultural and political barriers. When countries compete in a football match, for instance, fans become engrossed in the game rather than the complexities of international relations. This temporary diversion allows people to channel their emotions and energies toward cheering for their teams, which can help to diminish hostility. By diverting focus from conflicts to thrilling contests, sports serve as a medium for building camaraderie among supporters, regardless of their nationalities.Moreover, international sporting events encourage individuals to display their national symbols, such as flags and traditional attire. This display of national pride fosters a sense of belonging and collective identity among fans. Isolated moments of joy, such as witnessing a goal scored by one’s national team, promote emotional connections that transcend political disagreements. Fans share the thrill of victory and the disappointment of defeat together, strengthening the notion of shared human experience. Furthermore, by showcasing their national colors and symbols, supporters express love for their homeland in a peaceful context, which can mitigate negative sentiments that might otherwise arise from political tensions.In conclusion, large-scale sports events like the football World Cup serve as powerful links to peace and serve to invigorate patriotic emotions in a constructive manner. By redirecting attention from conflicts to the collective experience of sports, these occasions foster unity, encourage national pride, and alleviate tensions between nations, demonstrating the essential role sports play in promoting harmony in an increasingly divided world.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;"The debate surrounding the promotion of alternative energy sources is critical in light of the escalating climate crisis and the depletion of conventional resources. Currently, the major source of energy globally is hydroelectric power, which, while being renewable, is not without its challenges. Water scarcity has become a pressing issue in many regions, leading to a paradox where countries remain heavily dependent on hydropower despite the diminishing availability of water resources. This reliance could lead to significant energy shortfalls as climate change exacerbates water shortages.Moreover, the predominant energy sources used today, including fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are notorious for their detrimental effects on the environment. The combustion of these fuels releases substantial quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which contributes significantly to global warming. As nations strive to meet energy demands, they inadvertently intensify the planet's warming, resulting in catastrophic weather events and long-term ecological damage.In this context, it is imperative for governments to take proactive measures to promote alternative sources of energy such as wind, solar, and geothermal. These renewable sources offer a sustainable solution with minimal environmental footprint. For instance, solar energy harnesses the abundant sunlight, while wind energy capitalizes on natural weather patterns. Unlike fossil fuels, these alternatives do not produce harmful emissions, making them essential in the battle against climate change.In conclusion, I strongly agree that governments should escalate their efforts to promote alternative energy sources. Not only would this shift reduce reliance on limited and polluting energy sources, but it would also foster innovation and create jobs. Ultimately, investing in renewable energy is not merely an environmental imperative; it is a sustainable path toward a resilient future for humanity."
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;"Unemployment is undeniably a pressing global issue, affecting both developed and developing countries. The inability to find work not only impacts individuals but also significantly hinders economic growth, exacerbating poverty and social issues. While some advocate for direct financial assistance from the government to support unemployed individuals, I believe it is ultimately the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens to find ways to help themselves.Firstly, individual empowerment plays a crucial role in overcoming unemployment. When disadvantaged citizens are encouraged to seek employment through their own efforts, they tend to develop a sense of independence and self-worth. This process can foster the development of skills and resilience, which are essential for enduring economic hardship. Relying on government support may lead to a dependency that could stymie personal growth and initiative.Moreover, governments often face constrained budgets and competing priorities, especially in developing nations where resources are limited. Prioritizing direct financial aid could divert funds from essential services such as education and healthcare, which are vital for enabling individuals to gain the skills needed for employment. By investing in programs that foster vocational training, education, and entrepreneurship, governments can help create a more sustainable and self-sufficient workforce, ultimately benefiting the economy in the long run.In addition, not all unemployment is a result of a lack of available jobs; some job seekers may need to adapt to the changing market landscape. Encouraging citizens to be proactive in retraining or upskilling themselves can result in a more flexible and competitive workforce, better equipped to meet the demands of the modern economy.In conclusion, while the plight of the unemployed is a significant global challenge, I contend that empowering individuals to aid themselves is a more effective solution than providing direct financial assistance. By focusing on skill development and encouraging personal responsibility, we can create a more resilient society that enables individuals to thrive regardless of their circumstances."
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;The debate surrounding the primary function of a university has sparked diverse opinions among educators, students, and employers. Some argue that universities should focus on equipping graduates with the practical skills and knowledge required in the workplace. Conversely, others advocate for a more traditional view, proposing that the principal role of a university is to provide access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of its direct applicability to the job market.In my opinion, while both perspectives hold merit, the essence of a university lies in its role as a medium for conveying and providing access to knowledge. A university should not be strictly reduced to a vocational training center. Instead, it should aspire to cultivate critical thinking, creativity, and a broad intellectual foundation among its students. Knowledge, after all, encompasses not only practical skills but also theoretical understanding and philosophical inquiry, which are crucial for addressing complex global issues.Furthermore, rather than offering a narrow set of courses designed solely for immediate application in the workforce, universities should provide a diverse array of subjects that inspire curiosity and foster lifelong learning. The dynamic nature of today’s job market means that specific skills can quickly become obsolete. Therefore, the emphasis should be on equipping students with adaptable thinking and problem-solving abilities, allowing them to thrive in a variety of professional contexts.Moreover, universities can facilitate access to specialized training when needed, expanding their role beyond foundational education. By maintaining a balance between practical training and the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, universities can nurture well-rounded individuals who can contribute meaningfully to society. In a world where knowledge is constantly evolving, the core function of a university should be to inspire a love for learning, enabling graduates to navigate and contribute to an ever-changing landscape. Thus, embracing both perspectives creates a holistic educational experience that prepares students for both careers and meaningful lives.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;The notion that zoos serve no useful purpose is a contentious debate that merits careful consideration. While proponents of zoos argue that they play a role in conservation and education, I contend that they are often more detrimental than beneficial in the protection of wildlife. This perspective is largely rooted in the belief that zoos can act more as killers than protectors.Firstly, the very concept of confining animals to a limited space can lead to psychological and physical health issues for the animals involved. Many species lose their natural instincts in captivity, leading to issues such as abnormal behaviors and decreased lifespans. For instance, large mammals like elephants and big cats often suffer in small enclosures, which fail to replicate their natural habitats. This confinement can reduce their ability to hunt, socialize, and thrive, ultimately compromising the intrinsic value of wildlife.Moreover, the argument for strict laws prohibiting poaching provides a more effective means of protecting endangered species in their natural habitats. When laws are enforced vigorously to protect wildlife, animals can thrive in their ecosystems without the disruptions caused by human intervention typical of zoos. For example, preservation efforts in places like national parks have proven successful in increasing populations of threatened animals, indicating that conservation can indeed occur outside of zoos.In conclusion, while some may see zoos as centers of education and conservation, I believe their role is often more harmful than helpful. Instead of encouraging the confinement of animals, we should focus on protecting their natural habitats through strict laws against poaching and habitat destruction. Only then can we truly honor the lives of these majestic creatures, ensuring their survival in a way that respects their natural behaviors and ecosystems.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;In recent years, distance-learning programs have gained immense popularity, catalyzed by advancements in technology and the increased need for flexibility in education. While some critics argue that online learning does not measure up to traditional in-person college or university experiences, I contend that distance-learning should be widely embraced in higher education due to its significant convenience, accessibility, and ability to foster broader educational opportunities.One of the most compelling advantages of distance-learning programs is the convenience they offer to students globally. Online education allows individuals to access resources and courses from anywhere, eliminating geographical barriers. This flexibility enables busy students—who may be working or managing family responsibilities—to pursue their academic goals without compromising other aspects of their lives. Furthermore, distance-learning offers a more personalized pace, allowing learners to engage with materials according to their own schedules and learning styles.Moreover, the advent of video conferencing technology has transformed the educational landscape, facilitating real-time interactions between instructors and a larger audience. This capability not only democratizes access to quality education but also allows educators to reach a diverse group of students, fostering a richer learning environment. Instructors can capitalize on this technology to conduct lectures, discussions, and collaborative projects, enriching the distance-learning experience and creating a sense of community among participants.In conclusion, while there are legitimate concerns surrounding the interpersonal elements of online education, the benefits it brings in terms of convenience, accessibility, and large-scale engagement far outweigh these drawbacks. As technology continues to evolve, distance-learning programs represent a practical and innovative approach to education, making it essential for colleges and universities to adopt and integrate these methods. By doing so, educational institutions can better serve a global population of learners, facilitating lifelong learning opportunities in an increasingly interconnected world.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";In recent years, modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, emails, and internet chat programs like MSN Messenger have transformed the way people interact and share information. While these innovations have undoubtedly brought significant advantages, opinions vary on their overall impact, particularly regarding accessibility and inclusivity. Proponents of modern communication technologies point to the considerable benefits they provide. Mobile phones allow for instant connectivity across great distances, empowering individuals to maintain personal relationships and professional networks. Emails have revolutionized the workplace, facilitating swift communication and collaboration on a global scale. Furthermore, internet chat programs have fostered online communities, enabling people to connect based on shared interests, regardless of geographic limitations. For many, these technologies have enhanced productivity, allowed for more flexible work arrangements, and improved access to information.However, critics argue that the benefits of modern communication are not uniformly distributed. They contend that access to these technologies is often limited to more affluent individuals and communities, creating a digital divide. In many low-income areas, the lack of reliable internet access and the high cost of mobile devices can hinder people's ability to participate in an increasingly digital world. As a result, these individuals miss out on opportunities for education, employment, and social interaction that others take for granted. In conclusion, while modern communication technologies have undoubtedly created significant benefits for many, it is essential to acknowledge that these advantages are not universally experienced. The disparity in access to these technologies highlights a critical issue that society must address. Ensuring that all individuals have equal opportunity to benefit from modern communication innovations is crucial for fostering an inclusive and equitable future.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;The debate over whether musical lessons should be mandatory in high school education is a contentious one, with strong arguments on both sides. Proponents of mandatory music education believe that incorporating music as a main subject can greatly enhance students' creativity, discipline, and emotional intelligence. They assert that music fosters teamwork through group performances and encourages self-expression, which are vital skills for personal and professional development. Additionally, music education has been linked to improved academic performance, particularly in subjects like math and language.Conversely, opponents of mandatory music lessons argue that such subjects may divert valuable time and resources away from more essential, occupation-related studies. They contend that high school is a critical period for students to hone their skills in areas that will support their future careers, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Critics of mandatory music education fear that it may lead students to focus on subjects that they may not pursue in the future, diluting their academic experience and hindering their essential skill acquisition.From my perspective, while the benefits of music education are undeniable, it should not be mandated for all students. Instead, schools should offer music as an optional subject that students can choose based on their interests and career ambitions. This approach allows students to align their education with their future goals, focusing on occupation-related subjects that will benefit them professionally. In this way, music can be appreciated for its artistic value without compromising the development of essential skills in other disciplines. Ultimately, education should be tailored to students’ individual aspirations, enabling them to thrive in an increasingly competitive world.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;In the context of higher education, the allocation of funding is a critical issue that influences the overall success of universities. While both libraries and sports activities play important roles in enriching the university experience, I firmly believe that universities should prioritize investment in libraries over athletic programs.Firstly, libraries are vital and strategic components of educational institutions. They serve as the heart of academic resources, providing students and faculty with access to a vast array of books, journals, and digital materials. This access is essential for research, learning, and the development of critical thinking skills. A well-resourced library supports a culture of scholarship and inquiry, enabling students to thrive academically. The presence of a strong library not only enhances the educational experience but also attracts potential students, contributing to the university's reputation and enrollment rates.Secondly, it is important to note that libraries typically do not generate income through external channels like many athletic programs do. Sports activities often have sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise opportunities that can offset some of their operational costs. In contrast, libraries rely heavily on university funding and donations to maintain and update their collections. Without adequate financial support, libraries may struggle to provide students with the latest research materials and technological resources, directly impacting the quality of education.In conclusion, while sports activities contribute to student well-being and campus life, the foundational role of libraries in academic success cannot be overstated. Investing in libraries not only fulfills the immediate educational needs of students but also ensures the long-term sustainability and growth of the academic institution. Therefore, I advocate that universities focus their funding priorities on libraries, securing a strong educational base for their students' future success.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";The rise of English as a global lingua franca brings with it a host of advantages and disadvantages, particularly concerning the fate of lesser-known languages. Proponents of English argue that its widespread use fosters international communication and collaboration, enabling people from diverse backgrounds to engage in commerce, education, and cultural exchange. This connectivity can lead to enhanced economic opportunities, scientific advancements, and a greater understanding between different cultures, ultimately contributing to a more integrated world.However, the predominance of English also has alarming repercussions for linguistic and cultural diversity. Opponents assert that as English gains dominance, many lesser-used languages are at risk of extinction. Approximately 40% of the world’s languages, many of which are integral to the identity of specific cultural communities, are projected to disappear within the next century. This decline not only erodes cultural heritage but also diminishes the rich tapestry of human expression that these languages represent. Each language embodies unique ways of viewing and interpreting the world, and their loss is irreplaceable.Furthermore, while English is often lauded for its richness and adaptability, it is not universally effective in encapsulating every cultural nuance, particularly in regions of Asia where languages are deeply tied to cultural identity. Languages structured differently from English often contain expressions, idioms, or concepts that lack direct translations. The inadequacy of English to express certain cultural details can lead to misunderstandings and oversight of essential nuances that are pivotal for authentic cultural representation.In conclusion, while the global prevalence of English offers substantial advantages in terms of communication and interconnectedness, it also poses a significant threat to linguistic and cultural diversity. The cost of this linguistic domination—seen in the erosion of lesser-known languages—raises pressing concerns that warrant serious consideration. Ultimately, balancing the benefits of global communication with the imperative to preserve linguistic diversity is critical for fostering a culturally rich and inclusive world.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The debate surrounding the use of animals for human benefit is a contentious issue, with voices on both sides advocating for their beliefs. On one hand, many people argue that utilizing animals to fulfill human needs is a natural part of life. Whether it is for food, labor, or companionship, the argument is that humans have domesticated these animals and thus have the right to benefit from them. This perspective often overlooks the ethical implications of such practices, leading to the exploitation of animals.Conversely, there is a growing concern about the treatment of animals, prompting calls for their rights to be protected. Critics argue that too many farmers and animal owners exploit their charges beyond humane limits. In various industries, animals are subjected to overcrowded living conditions, inadequate healthcare, and harsh treatments, all in the name of profit. These practices highlight a significant moral failing in our relationship with animals. Critics assert that our species has a duty to act as guardians of these sentient beings rather than as overlords. This perspective champions empathy and stewardship, suggesting that animals deserve to live free from unnecessary suffering and exploitation.The discussion around animal rights and use underscores a vital question of ethics and morality in human behavior. While it is true that humans have leveraged animals for centuries, this relationship must evolve. A more compassionate view would advocate for a coexistence based on respect and protection rather than domination and exploitation. Balancing human needs with animal rights is essential, fostering an ecosystem where both can thrive. As society progresses, it is imperative that we reassess our approach to animals, grounding our practices in guardianship rather than mastery. In doing so, we not only elevate the status of animals but also enhance our moral integrity as a species.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";The advent of modern technology has indeed transformed the methods by which we engage with art and culture, allowing people to view exhibitions from the comfort of their homes through virtual tours, high-resolution images, and informative videos. However, the notion that museums and art galleries will soon disappear due to these advancements is overly simplistic and misses the significant importance that these institutions hold.Museums and art galleries serve as vital custodians of culture and history. They provide an opportunity for education that transcends what can be conveyed through a screen. Visitors to these spaces often find that the experience of being in the presence of authentic artifacts is irreplaceable. The tactile quality of seeing art up close, with the ability to appreciate intricate details, colors, and textures, is something that images and videos simply cannot replicate. This physical interaction fosters a deeper emotional connection to the works, stimulating curiosity and inspiring creativity in ways that digital formats may not achieve.Moreover, museums and galleries offer invaluable communal experiences. They serve as social spaces where individuals from diverse backgrounds can come together to appreciate and discuss art and history. These interactions promote cultural understanding and dialogue, enriching communities and fostering a sense of shared heritage. Virtual experiences, while beneficial, often lack the depth of engagement that physical visits afford.In conclusion, while modern technology provides valuable tools for accessibility and increased exposure to art and culture, it does not render museums and galleries obsolete. These institutions play an essential role in preserving our heritage, educating the public, and facilitating meaningful human connections. Therefore, rather than disappearing, museums and art galleries will likely continue to evolve, integrating technology to enhance the visitor experience while maintaining their irreplaceable value.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;The debate surrounding whether teenagers should engage with a broad curriculum encompassing all subjects or focus exclusively on their strengths and interests is one that garners differing views among parents, educators, and students themselves. Proponents of a comprehensive education argue that exposure to a wide range of subjects fosters well-rounded individuals capable of critical thinking and adaptability in an ever-changing world. They assert that skills gained from diverse disciplines—such as mathematics, science, literature, and the arts—contribute to a holistic understanding and can be invaluable in the workforce. Parents who support a full curriculum often believe that this approach encourages students to explore varied paths, discover hidden talents, and cultivate a diverse skill set that might be beneficial later in life.Conversely, there are those who advocate for a more focused educational approach, suggesting that students should hone in on subjects that resonate with their interests or in which they show particular aptitude. This perspective posits that by concentrating on a specific area, learners can achieve deeper understanding and skill mastery, ultimately leading to greater success and satisfaction. For instance, a teenager with a passion for the sciences may thrive when allowed to dedicate more time to biology and chemistry, rather than spreading themselves thinly across subjects in which they have less interest. Furthermore, this specialized approach can reduce stress and anxiety, providing students with a sense of agency over their learning experiences.In my opinion, while a well-rounded education is important, it is equally vital for students to be allowed to focus on subjects they are passionate about. Encouraging students to choose areas of interest can lead to greater engagement and motivation, ultimately fostering a love for learning. A balanced approach that combines foundational knowledge across subjects with the freedom to specialize may provide the best outcome for young learners in preparing them for both academic pursuits and life beyond school.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;The rise of English as a global lingua franca has undeniably led to the decline of many lesser-known languages, a phenomenon that raises concerns about cultural heritage and linguistic diversity. However, in my view, the advantages of English predominance significantly outweigh the disadvantages. One of the most compelling benefits of widespread English usage is its role in educational accessibility. In my country, English is a mandatory subject starting from elementary school, which fosters proficiency in the language among the youth. This foundational knowledge opens up numerous opportunities for students, particularly in the context of studying abroad. As global education becomes increasingly competitive, being proficient in English enables students to apply for higher education in prestigious institutions worldwide. They gain access to international academic resources and networks, ultimately enhancing their personal and professional development.Furthermore, English serves as a critical tool for researchers, particularly in high-tech fields. Modern scientific literature and technological documentation are predominantly published in English. Researchers proficient in the language can tap into a vast reservoir of knowledge, which is essential for innovation and collaboration. This linguistic ability allows individuals and countries to remain competitive in the fast-evolving landscape of global technology and research.While the loss of lesser-known languages signifies a cultural shift and poses risks to the preservation of unique identities, embracing English can be seen as a necessary adaptation to the realities of globalization. It provides a shared medium for communication, fostering international collaboration and understanding. In conclusion, despite the concerning decline of lesser-known languages, the advantages of learning and using English are profound. The opportunities it creates for education, research, and cross-cultural dialogue contribute significantly to personal growth and national advancement, making it a valuable asset in an interconnected world.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";"The debate surrounding the freedom of creative expression for artists is both complex and contentious. On one hand, creativity thrives in an environment of freedom, where artists can explore and convey their ideas without fear of censorship or retribution. This liberated atmosphere fosters innovation and allows diverse perspectives to flourish, enriching culture and society as a whole. When artists are constrained, the vibrancy of their work diminishes; creativity begins to stagnate and conform rather than challenge, inspire, and provoke thought.However, while the ideal of unrestricted creative freedom is appealing, it is essential to acknowledge that artists also bear a responsibility towards the society in which they operate. Creativity can be a double-edged sword—art has the power to enlighten, but it can also offend or mislead. Artists must wield their influence with care, ensuring that their work does not unjustly hurt the sentiments of individuals or groups. The responsibility lies in striking a balance that respects both artistic expression and the sensitivities of the audience.I believe that government restrictions can sometimes be necessary to maintain this balance. While censorship can stifle creativity, it is crucial to create a framework where artists can express themselves freely while still being accountable for the social impacts of their work. Instead of outright censorship, perhaps a more constructive approach would involve fostering dialogue between artists and the community, encouraging artists to be mindful of their audience without compromising their creative vision.In conclusion, while artists should fundamentally enjoy the freedom to express their ideas, it is also vital to recognize the importance of social responsibility. A symbiotic relationship should exist between creative freedom and societal values, ensuring that the vibrant tapestry of human expression is enriched without marginalizing or offending others."
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;The debate surrounding whether to nurture a sense of competition or cooperation in children reflects differing views on child development and societal progress. On one hand, proponents of encouraging competition argue that a competitive spirit fosters resilience and ambition. Through competition, children learn to strive for excellence, setting goals and working hard to achieve them. This drive has historically contributed to advancements in various fields, particularly science and technology, as individuals and groups push boundaries to outperform one another. The competitive ethos, often seen in educational systems and sports, can inspire innovation, cultivate leadership skills, and prepare youth for real-world challenges.Conversely, advocates for promoting cooperation argue that instilling collaborative skills is essential for creating useful adults. In a world increasingly characterized by interconnectedness, the ability to work effectively within teams is paramount. Cooperative children are likely to grow into empathetic adults, capable of navigating complex social dynamics and fostering supportive environments. The collaborative approach encourages collective problem-solving, emphasizing that success is more sustainable when achieved together. Moreover, the “your loss, my gain” mentality that accompanies cutthroat competition often leads to animosity rather than achievement, undermining long-term relationships and community well-being.Ultimately, both competition and cooperation are essential, akin to two sides of the same coin that cannot be separated in the development of well-rounded individuals. They complement each other, with healthy competition driving personal achievement while cooperative skills ensure that individuals can work towards common goals. In my opinion, a balanced approach that values both competition and cooperation can cultivate a generation of innovative, resilient, and socially responsible adults. By encouraging children to embrace both principles, we equip them with the necessary tools to thrive and contribute positively to society, understanding that mutual success often stems from collaboration rather than exclusion.
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";"The debate surrounding capital punishment often elicits strong opinions on both sides. Proponents argue that the death penalty is essential for maintaining societal security, particularly against violent crime. While I acknowledge the complexities of this issue, I believe that the assertion that without capital punishment our lives are less secure and crimes of violence will inevitably increase is a limited perspective.Firstly, it is critical to recognize that crime is always punishable, but the methods of punishment should align with modern values, emphasizing rehabilitation and restorative justice over retribution. The notion of retribution—where the punishment is seen as a deserved consequence of wrongdoing—can, in theory, deter future crimes. However, the effectiveness of capital punishment as a deterrent is highly contested. Studies have shown that the fear of severe penalties does not universally translate into a reduced crime rate.The argument that capital punishment is reserved for the ""rarest of the rare"" cases points to its selective application; however, this raises concerns about the potential for misuse and the disproportionate application based on race, socio-economic status, and other factors. When the criminal system is fallible, the risk of executing innocent individuals becomes a heavy moral burden.Furthermore, the true deterrent against violent crime lies in a combination of social factors such as economic equality, education, and mental health support rather than the threat of execution. A criminal mind may be aware of the ultimate punishment but is often propelled by circumstances that cloud rational decision-making.In conclusion, while capital punishment may be seen as a necessary means to control violence by some, I argue that it is not the most effective or ethical approach. A more comprehensive strategy that addresses the root causes of crime and prioritizes justice system reform, instead of retribution, holds greater promise for creating a safer society."
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;In several countries, it is becoming increasingly common for young people to take a gap year—a year off for work or travel—after finishing high school and before commencing university studies. This practice, while praised for its potential benefits, also faces criticism and is considered by some as a waste of time.In many education systems, students undergo a continuous academic journey from the age of 5 until approximately 16 years old. This rigorous regimen can lead to burnout and uncertainty regarding future career paths. A year-long break offers young minds a valuable respite, allowing them to recharge and gain new perspectives. Traveling or working during this period can provide experiences that classroom learning often lacks, enabling students to discover their passions and interests more authentically. For example, a student who travels might develop a love for cultural studies or international relations, while another who works may discover a talent for business or a particular trade.However, critics argue that such a break can be a diversion from academic momentum, posing risks of losing focus and direction. In some cultures, the prevailing mindset is that any interruption in education is a setback, potentially leading to delayed career trajectories and economic instability. Additionally, not all young people have the financial capability to travel or engage in meaningful work outside academic circles, which can exacerbate inequalities among peers.In conclusion, the decision to take a gap year presents both advantages and disadvantages. While it can serve as a transformative period for personal growth and self-discovery, it can also present challenges in terms of academic continuity and economic viability. Ultimately, the impact of this decision largely depends on individual circumstances and how the experience is utilized to inform future academic and career choices.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";The advent of computers has undeniably ushered in a new era, changing the very fabric of human existence. As a device, the computer has not only enhanced productivity but has also fostered global connectivity, paving the way for a world reliant on technology. Today, we observe computers performing essential functions across various sectors, including business, healthcare, crime detection, and even aviation. This dependency on computers has provided immense convenience, transforming mundane tasks into lightning-fast processes. For instance, data analytics in businesses allows for informed decision-making, while electronic health records in hospitals streamline patient care and improve outcomes.Looking into the future, the role of computers is set to expand even further. They are expected to influence emerging fields such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and automation. In the near future, we may see advanced computers crafting personalized medicine tailored to individual genetic profiles or even autonomous vehicles navigating our roads, thereby reshaping urban lifestyles. However, this increasing reliance on computers does not come without its drawbacks. The centralization of data raises significant concerns regarding privacy and security. Cyber threats pose risks that can disrupt lives and economies, as reliance on digital systems grows. Additionally, there is the danger of diminishing critical thinking and problem-solving skills in individuals who depend heavily on technology for everyday tasks. Furthermore, widespread job displacement due to automation could lead to economic disparities.In conclusion, while the dependence on computers presents numerous benefits, such as convenience and speed, it invites a critical examination of its implications. Embracing technology while remaining vigilant to its risks will enable us to harness its potential effectively. As we navigate this computer-centric future, we must ensure that we retain the core human qualities of creativity, critical thinking, and ethical consideration. Balancing innovation with caution will ultimately define our relationship with computers and their role in shaping our future.
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;The debate surrounding gender equality in higher education has gained considerable traction in recent years. One proposal suggests that universities should admit equal numbers of male and female students across all subjects. While I believe in the importance of promoting gender equity in education, I contend that enforcing equal admissions in every discipline may not be the most effective or realistic approach.Co-education plays a vital role in helping both genders to interact and collaborate, fostering a healthy environment where mutual respect and understanding can flourish. Mixed-gender educational settings encourage students to appreciate diverse perspectives, enhancing their social skills and preparing them for the real world, where they will inevitably work alongside individuals of the opposite gender. Such integration is essential for dispelling stereotypes and dismantling gender biases that persist in certain fields.Critically, one of the major obstacles to gender equality in specific disciplines, such as mathematics and mechanical engineering, is the prevailing male chauvinistic attitudes that propagate the notion that women are less capable or inherently unfitted for these areas. This discriminatory viewpoint not only dissuades women from pursuing interests in such fields but also perpetuates a damaging narrative that undervalues their contributions. A gender-biased approach in education stunts the progress of society as it forfeits the potential and talent that individuals of half the population possess.However, mandating equal numbers of male and female students in every subject does not necessarily address the root of the issue. Instead of quotas, universities should prioritize creating inclusive environments and marketing fields traditionally dominated by one gender to the opposite gender. The focus should be on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcome. Improving access, support, and mentoring for women in underrepresented fields may prove to be more effective in encouraging diversity than simply enforcing numerical quotas. Ultimately, a balanced representation can flourish naturally in an educational system that champions inclusion and merit-based achievements.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;The debate surrounding the effectiveness of traditional games versus modern games in the development of children's skills is a compelling one. While both types of games contribute to children's growth, I firmly believe that traditional games have a more significant role in developing essential abilities.Traditional games, passed down through generations, often emphasize social interactions and communication. These games typically require face-to-face engagement, fostering the development of vital communication skills. Children learn to express themselves, negotiate rules, and collaborate with peers, all of which are critical abilities for their overall social development. In contrast, many modern games, particularly video games, can isolate players and diminish real-life interactions, as they often prioritize solo gameplay or online interactions rather than fostering deep personal connections.Additionally, traditional games encourage physical activity, enhancing children's motor skills and overall health. Activities like tag, hide-and-seek, or various team sports not only develop physical coordination but also instill important values such as teamwork, fair play, and perseverance. In many cases, modern games, especially video games, lack this physical component, leading to a sedentary lifestyle that can adversely affect children's health and well-being.Moreover, it's important to note that modern games are primarily developed by companies aiming for profit. As a result, the focus tends to be on entertainment rather than educational value. While some modern games undoubtedly have educational elements, the underlying goal often remains profit-driven, which can detract from their utility in skill development.In conclusion, I posit that parents and educators should place greater emphasis on traditional games in children's development. The fundamental social, physical, and cognitive skills fostered through these timeless activities hold lasting value, nurturing not only well-rounded individuals but also harmonious communities. Thus, traditional games indeed prove more useful than their modern counterparts in developing crucial skills in children.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The allocation of government funds has long been a contentious issue, with competing interests often vying for limited resources. While the construction of theaters and sports stadiums can foster community spirit and generate economic activity, many argue that these investments pale in comparison to the pressing needs of medical care and education. I firmly align myself with this viewpoint, as prioritizing healthcare and education is not only essential but also a moral obligation of any government.Firstly, the necessity for accessible and high-quality medical care cannot be overstated. In a society where health disparities are significant, investing in medical infrastructure directly contributes to the well-being of citizens. A robust healthcare system ensures that all individuals can receive timely treatment, potentially leading to a healthier population that is productive and capable of contributing to the economy. Conversely, spending on entertainment venues often caters to a specific demographic and, more importantly, does little to address the urgent healthcare needs of the broader community.Furthermore, education serves as the cornerstone of societal development. By allocating funds to educational institutions, governments help foster an informed and skilled populace, which can drive innovation and economic growth. Education equips individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate an increasingly complex world, providing a pathway out of poverty and inequality. Investing in education yields long-term benefits that far outweigh the temporary boosts that sports and entertainment facilities may provide.Additionally, using taxpayer money for theaters or stadiums raises ethical concerns. Many taxpayers may not benefit from such facilities, particularly if they cannot afford tickets or if such amenities do not align with their interests. This perceived inequity can lead to discontent among citizens who feel their money is being misallocated.In conclusion, while theaters and sports stadiums have their place in society, the government should prioritize funding for medical care and education. These domains address fundamental human needs, contribute to societal welfare, and create a fairer, more equitable community for all citizens.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;"The debate surrounding the impact of technological advancement on traditional skills and ways of life evokes strong opinions on both sides. While some people express apprehension that modern technology threatens the preservation of traditional practices, I would argue that technology, when utilized correctly, can enhance and promote these skills rather than extinguish them.Firstly, it is important to acknowledge the concern that rapid technological development might overshadow traditional techniques. Old crafts, artisanal skills, and age-old practices risk fading from memory as society embraces modern conveniences. For example, the rise of fast fashion has overshadowed traditional garment-making techniques, leaving many skilled artisans struggling to sustain their craft. The fear is understandable; however, it overlooks the potential of technology as a tool for preservation rather than a hindrance.On the contrary, technology has the potential to revitalize traditional skills by making them accessible to broader audiences. It allows for the documentation, sharing, and teaching of these practices on a global scale. For instance, platforms like YouTube and social media provide a space for artisans to showcase their crafts, reaching audiences far beyond their local communities. This not only preserves traditional techniques but also inspires a renewed interest among younger generations who might otherwise be unaware of such practices.Moreover, advancements in technology can facilitate the promotion of traditional skills in ways that are both efficient and effective. Virtual workshops and online courses can bring expert artisans into contact with eager learners, transcending geographical barriers. In this manner, technology acts as a bridge, connecting the past with the present and ensuring that traditional skills continue to thrive in a modern context.In conclusion, while concerns about the obsolescence of traditional ways of life in the face of technological progress are valid, I believe that technology can serve as a powerful ally in their promotion and preservation. Rather than being a detriment, it can assist in ensuring that traditional skills are celebrated and passed down through generations."
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";The question of whether creative artists should be granted absolute freedom to express their ideas is a contentious debate. While some argue that artists possess too much freedom and that government intervention is necessary, I firmly believe that freedom of expression should be celebrated and protected.Critics of unrestricted artistic freedom often cite concerns over social misleading and the potential to destabilize society. They argue that unchecked creative expression can spread dangerous ideologies, promote violence, or propagate stereotypes that might lead to social discord. For instance, explicit music lyrics or graphic imagery in films may contravene societal norms and values, prompting calls for government intervention. However, limiting artistic freedom can stifle creativity and hinder social progress. Art has historically played a crucial role in challenging oppressive norms and provoking thoughtful discourse. Artists often serve as the conscience of society, pushing boundaries and encouraging audiences to question their beliefs.Furthermore, the presumption that government regulation can effectively manage artistic output underestimates the complexity of creative expression. What might be deemed offensive or misleading to one group could resonate profoundly with another. Thus, imposing restrictions based on subjective interpretations threatens to dilute the diversity and richness that art brings to culture. For instance, many progressive movements owe their voice to artists who challenged societal norms and faced backlash for it.While it is vital to maintain a balance that protects society from harmful content, this balance should never come at the expense of creativity and expression. The risks associated with unfettered artistic expression must be weighed against the paramount importance of freedom. In my view, artists should be entrusted with the freedom to create, as it is through such creative expression that society can evolve, understand diverse perspectives, and promote empathy and unity.
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;"In contemporary society, the portrayal of violence in media serves as a contentious issue, particularly regarding its potential influence on real-world violent behaviors. While acknowledging the complexity of this relationship, I argue that the government should indeed implement measures to control the depictions of violence in media to reduce the incidence of violent crimes.Media outlets often showcase violence in its most extreme forms to captivate audiences and maximize ratings. This sensationalism can distort perceptions of reality, leading viewers to believe that violent incidents are more common than they are. When violence is glamorized, it can glorify aggressive behavior and desensitize individuals, especially impressionable youth, to the severity and consequences of such actions. Thus, excessive portrayals can inadvertently cultivate a culture of violence that filters into everyday life.It is crucial to acknowledge that violence is a factual aspect of the world and must be reported; however, the manner and context in which it is presented are pivotal. Responsible reporting would focus on the underlying causes of violence, the ramifications for victims, and societal impacts rather than merely sensationalizing the act itself. This more nuanced approach would provide a clearer, more accurate understanding of violence without fueling harmful stereotypes or encouraging mimetic behavior.Moreover, by regulating violent content, the government can exert a positive influence on societal norms and foster an environment that prioritizes peaceful resolutions over aggression. Avoiding the extreme depiction of violence can also initiate broader discussions about the root causes of violent behavior, such as poverty, mental health issues, and societal disconnection.In conclusion, while violence is an undeniable reality deserving of attention in media, the government should play a crucial role in regulating its portrayal. By mitigating excessive and sensationalized violence, we can create a healthier media landscape that not only reduces the potential for violent crimes but also promotes a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding violence in our society."
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";The modern era has ushered in significant opportunities for women across various spheres, a change rooted in the ongoing revolution of feminism. While some argue that this progress has led to complications, I firmly believe that the benefits of increased opportunities for women far outweigh any challenges that may arise.Historically, women have been relegated to limited roles, often confined to domestic responsibilities. The feminist movement has challenged these norms, advocating for equality in education, the workforce, and broader societal participation. Today, women are not only pursuing higher education at unprecedented rates but are also occupying leadership roles in politics, business, and other fields. This advancement promotes diverse perspectives and innovative solutions, which are crucial to addressing contemporary global challenges.Moreover, a society that empowers women to thrive alongside men fosters more harmonious communal dynamics. When women are given equal opportunities, there is a positive ripple effect on families and communities. For instance, research has shown that investing in women and girls leads to significant economic growth and improves overall societal health and stability. Educated women tend to have better health outcomes and contribute to the educational attainment of future generations.On the contrary, some may argue that women's burgeoning roles lead to complexities within traditional family structures or increased stress levels. However, these challenges are often part of the necessary evolution toward a more equitable society. Adapting to change is inherently difficult, but it is essential for progress. Furthermore, shared responsibilities in households and workplaces can lead to healthier relationships and a more balanced division of labor.In conclusion, the increased opportunities for women represent a monumental step forward, not just for females, but for society as a whole. The prospect of equality brings numerous advantages that contribute to a better future, outshining any perceived drawbacks. Embracing this progress enriches human society, fostering growth, innovation, and unity.
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";"The assertion that increasing the price of petrol is the best way to address growing traffic and pollution problems raises several points for consideration. While it's true that price control strategies have been successful in various sectors, such as agriculture and real estate, their effectiveness in mitigating traffic and pollution issues requires a nuanced evaluation.On one hand, raising petrol prices could deter excessive car usage, steering individuals towards public transport, cycling, or walking. Theoretically, this could lead to fewer vehicles on the road, thereby reducing traffic congestion and lowering emissions from petrol-powered vehicles. However, the reliance on petrol prices alone overlooks the complexity of the factors contributing to pollution. Traffic and pollution are not solely products of fuel consumption; significant contributions also come from industrial processes, the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, and chemical pollutants emitted from various sources.Moreover, the demographic variation in transportation means must be taken into account. For lower-income individuals who may not have access to reliable public transportation, an increase in petrol prices could exacerbate financial difficulties without offering viable alternatives. To effectively combat traffic congestion and pollution, a multifaceted approach is necessary. Investment in public transportation infrastructure could provide a more sustainable solution by making alternatives to car travel safe and accessible. Additionally, promoting cleaner technologies—such as electric and hybrid vehicles—can substantially reduce emissions without solely relying on increased fuel prices. Urban planning strategies that encourage pedestrian-friendly cities and bike lanes can also diminish the dependency on automobiles.In conclusion, while raising petrol prices may contribute to reducing traffic and pollution, it is not a standalone solution. A combination of enhanced public transportation, investment in cleaner technologies, and urban planning is essential to truly alleviate these pressing issues, making our cities more livable and environmentally friendly."
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The debate surrounding the potential ban on advertisements is a contentious issue that requires careful consideration of both the merits and drawbacks of advertising. While I do acknowledge the persuasive power of advertisements, I fundamentally disagree with the idea of an outright ban. Instead, I believe the focus should be on regulating advertisements to promote ethical standards.Firstly, public service advertisements play a crucial role in society. Unlike commercial advertisements that are primarily focused on profit, public service announcements aim to disseminate valued culture and promote good moral traits. They are instrumental in raising awareness about pressing social issues, advocating for the disabled, and supporting the underprivileged. These campaigns shed light on important causes and foster a sense of community and responsibility among citizens. By encouraging donations, volunteerism, and social change, public service ads provide invaluable contributions to societal well-being.Conversely, commercial advertisements undeniably serve a vital purpose in the economy. By publicizing brand images and specific products, advertisements significantly drive sales and brand recognition for companies. This, in turn, fuels economic growth and creates job opportunities. A ban on advertisements could stifle innovation and competition, potentially leading to a stagnant market where consumers become detrimentally uninformed about their choices.However, it is essential to recognize that not all advertisements maintain high ethical standards. Many can be misleading or exploitative, targeting vulnerable populations or promoting unhealthy products. Therefore, rather than implementing a ban, a more prudent approach would involve enforcing stricter regulations to ensure advertisements are truthful, respectful, and socially responsible.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the nature of some advertisements, a complete ban would overlook the beneficial impacts of both commercial and public service announcements. Striking a balance through regulation can ensure that advertisements continue to serve their positive role in society without compromising ethical integrity.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;"In contemporary society, the relentless pace of life and the myriad challenges that individuals face can often lead to significant stress. From demanding job responsibilities to personal obligations, people are increasingly searching for effective ways to alleviate their stress and regain a sense of balance. While various methods exist, I firmly argue that exercise is the most suitable and beneficial approach to reducing stress for modern individuals.First and foremost, engaging in physical activity yields profound health benefits. Regular exercise helps improve cardiovascular health, increase endurance, and enhance overall physical fitness. These improvements not only contribute to a healthier body, but also foster a sense of accomplishment and empowerment. When individuals commit to exercise, they may find themselves more resilient in the face of stressors, as a healthy body can better cope with the demands of modern life. For instance, a brisk walk or an invigorating workout can work wonders in uplifting one's energy levels, thereby countering fatigue commonly linked to stress.Moreover, exercise is known for its ability to trigger the release of endorphins—often referred to as ""feel-good"" hormones. This natural chemical response leads to improved mood and increased feelings of happiness. For example, individuals who regularly engage in activities such as running, cycling, or practicing yoga often report a reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms. The sheer act of moving the body and focusing on physical tasks allows individuals to momentarily set aside worries, creating a mental space where positivity can flourish.In conclusion, while various methods for dealing with stress exist—such as reading or gardening—exercise is undoubtedly the most holistic and effective solution. By improving physical health and elevating mood, exercise provides not only a practical way to escape the burdens of modern life, but also fosters a healthier mindset in the long run. Therefore, incorporating regular exercise into one’s routine can serve as a powerful tool for managing stress and enhancing overall well-being."
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";"In the modern world, the age-old adage ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" encapsulates the growing dominance of visual imagery as a form of communication. Images, whether through photographs or films, have the unique ability to convey emotions, ideas, and narratives instantly, making them a powerful tool in a fast-paced digital landscape. I agree to a certain degree that images serve as a more effective means of communication than the written word. However, the significance of the written word remains irrefutable, as it continues to be a cornerstone of human expression.One of the most compelling aspects of visual communication is its universal nature. Images can transcend language barriers, offering a form of understanding that is often immediate and visceral. A photograph capturing a moment of joy or sorrow can evoke emotional responses from viewers regardless of their linguistic background. Similarly, films can weave together complex stories that resonate with diverse audiences as they appeal to shared human experiences and emotions. In this sense, images can be incredibly effective in conveying messages swiftly and powerfully.Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that the written word plays an equally vital role in communication. Textual forms offer depth, nuance, and clarity that images may lack. Written language allows for detailed explanations, arguments, and the articulation of complex thoughts in ways that visuals alone cannot achieve. Additionally, literature and written communication foster critical thinking and interpretation, prompting readers to engage with concepts on a deeper level.In conclusion, while images undoubtedly hold significant power in modern communication and can often leave a lasting impression, the importance of the written word should not be undervalued. Both forms of communication have their unique strengths, and together, they enrich our understanding of the world around us. Thus, I contend that a harmonious balance between visual and textual communication is essential for effective expression in today's society."
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;"The debate surrounding the preservation of endangered languages is multifaceted, with compelling arguments on both sides. Some people advocate for government funding to sustain these languages, suggesting that they represent valuable cultural heritage and diversity. Conversely, others view this allocation of public funds as imprudent, especially in a world facing pressing issues such as poverty and healthcare.Supporters of language preservation often argue that languages are more than mere communication tools; they embody the unique histories, identities, and worldviews of their speakers. By investing in minority languages, governments can promote cultural diversity and enhance social cohesion. Ethnolinguistic identity is crucial for many communities, and the disappearance of a language can sever those cultural ties. Additionally, this effort can foster tourism and stimulate local economies by attracting those interested in experiencing diverse cultures.However, the drawbacks of allocating public funds for saving minority languages cannot be overlooked. Critics argue that with limited resources, governments should prioritize areas that impact the majority, such as education, infrastructure, and healthcare. They contend that attempting to preserve languages spoken by minimal populations serves a niche interest rather than a broader societal benefit. Furthermore, the practicality of language revitalization programs often comes into question, as the number of speakers could be too limited to sustain meaningful engagement.In my opinion, this viewpoint requires thorough examination. While it is essential to recognize the cultural significance of minority languages, prioritizing effective resource allocation is vital. Governments must strike a balance between preservation efforts and addressing more immediate societal needs. In conclusion, both views have merit, but a strategic approach focusing on sustainability and broader benefits may ultimately serve society better."
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;"The debate over the funding of arts and music versus basic social welfare programs is one that elicits strong opinions on both sides. While some argue for the importance of fostering creativity and cultural expression through government support for the arts, I contend that priority should be given to essential social services like education and housing. Firstly, education plays a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of life. It provides individuals with knowledge and skills necessary for personal and professional development, leading to better job opportunities and economic stability. In a society where the foundational needs of its citizens are unmet, focusing resources on the arts may seem trivial. Taxpayer money could be more effectively allocated to educational programs that not only equip individuals with practical knowledge but also foster critical thinking and innovation. When people are educated, they are empowered to make informed decisions that improve their lives and communities.Moreover, housing is another fundamental necessity that directly impacts quality of life. Access to safe and affordable housing is crucial for mental and physical well-being; it provides a stable environment where individuals and families can thrive. Investing in housing initiatives can reduce homelessness and create a sense of belonging in society, further enhancing the quality of life.While the arts indeed add value to society by enriching cultural landscapes and providing emotional outlets, they are not key determinants of daily well-being. The government should prioritize investments that provide tangible benefits to its citizens. Knowledge and wisdom attained through education guarantee not only personal growth but also contribute to a more well-rounded and functional social system. In conclusion, while the arts have their place, it is essential for government funding to prioritize basic social welfare programs that directly improve the quality of life for citizens."
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;The debate surrounding government responsibility in funding healthcare and education is a contentious issue with compelling arguments on both sides. On one hand, many people believe that the government should be obligated to subsidize these vital services for all citizens. This perspective is rooted in the notion that access to healthcare and education is a fundamental human right. Proponents argue that when the government takes responsibility for these aspects, it fosters a healthier, more educated populace, ultimately benefiting society as a whole. A well-educated citizenry can contribute more effectively to economic growth, while accessible healthcare reduces the financial burden on families, ensuring that no one is forced into poverty due to medical costs.Conversely, others argue that it is not the government’s role to pay for the healthcare and education of every citizen. They assert that public funds should be managed responsibly, and providing extensive subsidies might lead to inefficiencies and wasted resources. Critics suggest that government involvement can result in increased taxes, which may discourage personal responsibility and initiative. They believe that individuals should take charge of their own health and education, relying on private institutions and personal investment instead.In my opinion, while I recognize the concerns regarding public expenditure, I believe the government has a moral obligation to fund healthcare, especially for the deprived and disadvantaged. Ensuring that every citizen has access to basic healthcare services not only promotes equality but also fosters a healthier society as a whole. Education is equally vital in bridging socioeconomic gaps, and government assistance can ensure that all individuals, regardless of their background, have the opportunity to succeed. In conclusion, while arguments exist for both sides, I contend that the government should play an essential role in providing healthcare and education to those in need, creating a more just and equitable society.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;The debate surrounding the existence of zoos in the 21st century is a contentious one, with animal-rights activists vocally asserting that wild animals should inhabit their natural environments and calling for the banning of zoos. While their concerns regarding the welfare of animals in captivity are valid and merit serious consideration, I find myself in opposition to the idea of eliminating zoos altogether. Instead, I believe that well-designed man-made environments can offer significant benefits both to the animals and to society as a whole.Firstly, modern zoos, when managed responsibly, can provide safe havens for wildlife, protecting them from poaching and habitat destruction prevalent in the wild. For many endangered species, a zoo can mean the difference between survival and extinction. Through carefully controlled breeding programs, zoos play a crucial role in conserving species that would likely perish in their natural habitats due to human activity. In this sense, zoos serve as a necessary refuge, maintaining biodiversity and ensuring future generations have the opportunity to learn about and appreciate these magnificent creatures.Secondly, a thoughtfully designed man-made environment can prolong the life spans of wild animals by providing proper veterinary care, nutrition, and protection from the myriad dangers present in the wild. Rather than merely serving as entertainment, many zoos now focus on education and awareness, cultivating an understanding of conservation issues among visitors. This engagement fosters a sense of responsibility toward wildlife, encouraging people to support conservation efforts and embrace a mindset that prioritizes the protection of animals and their habitats.In conclusion, while the arguments advocating for the complete ban of zoos hold some merit, I argue that the existence of well-managed zoos provides an opportunity for wildlife conservation and education. Rather than abolishing them, we should aspire to improve and reform zoos, ensuring they serve as sanctuaries that benefit both animals and humanity alike.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;Industrialized countries often grapple with severe environmental issues, leading some to argue that such damage is an inevitable consequence of a focus on improving standards of living. This notion, however, overlooks the potential for sustainable development, which can harmonize economic progress with environmental preservation.Critics often express concern that the relentless pursuit of economic growth can lead to the degradation of ecosystems. Deforestation, air and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity are common byproducts of prioritizing industrial advancement over ecological health. For instance, rapid urbanization and industrialization in countries like China and India have contributed to alarming levels of smog and waste, prompting fears that immediate economic gains come at the expense of long-term environmental stability.Nevertheless, I contend that flourishing economies can indeed coincide with effective environmental stewardship. Well-planned economic initiatives can incorporate sustainable practices that mitigate environmental damage while still fostering growth. For example, countries like Sweden and Denmark have successfully demonstrated that a robust green economy is attainable. Through investments in renewable energy, waste management systems, and sustainable agriculture, these nations not only maintained high standards of living but also took substantive steps to protect their ecosystems.It is essential to recognize that the choice to place economic development ahead of environmental protections can lead to irreversible harm. In some instances, industries exploit natural resources without considering the ecological consequences, resulting in degraded landscapes and harmed communities. This realization underscores the importance of integrated policies that balance economic ambitions with environmental ethics.In conclusion, while it is true that some industrialized nations face critical environmental concerns as they pursue economic goals, it is not an unavoidable outcome. With thoughtful planning and a commitment to sustainability, economic growth and environmental preservation can coexist, ensuring a prosperous future for both society and the planet.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;The debate over government spending priorities often generates polarized opinions, particularly regarding the allocation of tax money to public services versus the arts. Some people argue that funds should be redirected solely towards publically beneficial services, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. While these sectors undoubtedly require significant investment, I believe that the arts should also receive a share of government funding due to their intrinsic value and societal benefits.First and foremost, the arts play a crucial role in fostering a sense of community and cultural identity. Art in all its forms—be it music, visual art, theater, or literature—serves as a reflection of society, expressing collective values, beliefs, and struggles. Cultural events and public installations can enhance community cohesion and provide shared experiences, allowing individuals to connect on a deeper level. When the government invests in the arts, it not only preserves cultural heritage but also promotes social dialogue and understanding.Additionally, arts funding can have significant economic benefits. The creative sector contributes to job creation, tourism, and local businesses. Festivals, galleries, and performance venues often attract visitors, stimulating local economies. Moreover, investment in the arts can drive innovation, as creativity is a powerful catalyst for economic development. By supporting artists and cultural initiatives, the government fosters an environment where creativity can flourish, leading to a more vibrant economy.Lastly, the arts have profound educational benefits, enhancing critical thinking and emotional intelligence. Exposure to art can foster creativity, tolerance, and empathy in individuals, equipping them with essential skills for the future. Therefore, rather than seeing public services and the arts as mutually exclusive, it is critical to view them as complementary components of a well-rounded societal framework.In conclusion, while public services are undeniably important, government investment in the arts is equally vital. The arts enrich our lives, strengthen communities, and stimulate economies, making a case for a balanced approach to funding that includes both essential services and cultural initiatives.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;"The question of whether animals should be free and not kept in zoos is a contentious one, eliciting strong feelings from both sides. I firmly agree that animals should live in their natural habitats, as keeping them in captivity often disregards their rights and well-being.Critics of zoology argue that animals are sentient beings and should be considered non-human persons. This perspective highlights the ethical implications of confining creatures instinctively built to roam vast territories and engage with their environment. For instance, elephants, which are known to travel several miles a day in the wild, often exhibit signs of distress when kept in enclosures. Such confinement can lead to physical and psychological issues, with many animals displaying stereotypical behaviors, like pacing or over-grooming, indicative of stress.On the other hand, proponents of zoos argue that they serve as centers for conservation and education. They claim that by housing endangered species, they can help prevent extinction and foster a sense of connectivity between humans and wildlife. Furthermore, zoos often provide entertainment and education for the public, creating awareness about ecological balance.However, while these points may hold some validity, they often overlook the fundamental need for animals to thrive in their natural environments. The notion of ""conservation"" through captivity can be misleading, as it frequently places human interests above the natural rights of animals. Moreover, zoos cannot replicate the complex ecosystems where these animals truly belong, no matter how well-designed the habitats may be.In conclusion, the ethical implications of keeping animals in zoos ultimately outweigh the arguments for their conservation and entertainment value. Respecting animals as sentient beings entails recognizing their right to freedom, and efforts should be directed toward preserving their natural habitats instead. True conservation should be about ensuring animals can thrive in the wild, rather than confining them for human enjoyment."
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;"Advertising has become an omnipresent aspect of daily life, shaping consumer behavior and influencing societal trends. Opinions diverge on whether this phenomenon serves as a boon or a bane, with many advocating for the positive impacts while others highlight its detrimental effects.Proponents of advertising argue that it is a significant driver of economic growth. For instance, through effective marketing strategies, businesses can reach broader audiences, boosting sales and creating jobs. Advertisements inform consumers about new products and services, enabling informed choices. For example, social media platforms leverage targeted advertising, enhancing user experience by showcasing products aligned with individual preferences. Moreover, advertising can foster brand loyalty, as consumers often develop attachments to brands that resonate with their values and experiences.Conversely, critics of advertising contend that it often promotes consumerism and materialism, leading to unsustainable lifestyles. The barrage of advertisements can create unrealistic expectations and desires, especially among vulnerable populations such as children, who may struggle to distinguish between necessity and impulsiveness. Additionally, the overwhelming volume of advertising—particularly through digital channels—can lead to consumer fatigue. The automatic transmission of advertisements to personal devices through algorithms often intrudes into personal space, creating feelings of annoyance and invasion.In my opinion, while advertising carries inherent benefits, it is vital to address its negative implications. The key lies in finding a balance; ethics in advertising should be prioritized. Regulatory measures can ensure that advertisements are truthful and responsible, minimizing manipulation and exploitation. For instance, promoting healthy eating habits through engaging campaigns can have positive societal impacts rather than endorsing unhealthy food choices.In conclusion, advertising is a double-edged sword with both positive and negative attributes. By harnessing its benefits responsibly while mitigating its adverse effects, society can better navigate this ubiquitous facet of modern life, creating a more informed and balanced consumer culture."
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;"The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate, with proponents arguing that nuclear power offers an efficient and economical source of energy. They highlight the low greenhouse gas emissions during operation and the potential for reducing dependence on fossil fuels, thus combating climate change. Additionally, nuclear power plants can generate large amounts of energy consistently, providing a stable electricity supply that is often mentioned as a key advantage in an increasingly energy-hungry world.However, as far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usage of nuclear power. The disadvantages associated with nuclear technology, in my view, significantly overshadow its advantages. First and foremost is the inherent risk of catastrophic incidents, as witnessed in accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima. Such events not only endanger lives but also have long-term environmental impacts, rendering areas uninhabitable for decades.Moreover, the issue of radioactive waste disposal remains unresolved. Nuclear waste is hazardous and requires secure storage for thousands of years, posing a significant challenge for future generations. The potential for nuclear proliferation adds another layer of concern; the technology that generates electricity can similarly be applied to produce weapons-grade material, thus posing risks for global security.Economic factors also complicate the nuclear energy debate. While the operational costs may be low, the initial investment and decommissioning of power plants are exceedingly high. Furthermore, the financial burden associated with accidents and waste management is often underestimated.In conclusion, while nuclear power may offer some economic benefits and a low-carbon energy source, the substantial risks, environmental impacts, and unresolved waste issues lead me to believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Society should prioritize the development of renewable energy sources that provide sustainable and safe alternatives for our energy needs."
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;The debate about whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city is a nuanced one, with compelling arguments on both sides. While the idyllic charm of rural life has its merits, I argue that big cities often provide a more enriching environment for raising children.One of the primary advantages of city living is access to superior educational opportunities. Urban areas tend to boast a wider range of schools, including specialized institutions that cater to various learning styles and interests. This educational diversity can foster a more well-rounded intellectual growth in children, as they have the chance to engage with advanced curricula and extracurricular programs unavailable in rural settings.Furthermore, cities are equipped with an abundance of recreational facilities. Parks, museums, theaters, and sports complexes abound in urban areas, offering myriad avenues for children to explore their interests and develop new skills. The presence of these facilities promotes social interactions and engages children in structured activities that are crucial for their social and emotional development. In contrast, children in the countryside often spend their free time on farms or engaging in solitary outdoor play, which, while beneficial in its own right, may limit their exposure to diverse activities and socialization opportunities.Moreover, big cities are cultural melting pots, providing children with rich experiences that foster tolerance and understanding of diverse backgrounds. These intercultural interactions can cultivate empathy and critical social skills, essential in our increasingly global society. In conclusion, while life in the countryside offers tranquility and a connection to nature, I strongly believe that big cities present a more stimulating environment for children. The enhanced educational facilities, abundant recreational options, and exposure to diverse cultures position urban living as a preferable choice for raising well-rounded, socially adept children.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";The debate between working for a company and embarking on the journey of self-employment has garnered significant attention in recent years. In our society, jobs can generally be categorized into two main types: those provided by government-related organizations and those offered by private companies. While both paths come with their defining advantages and disadvantages, I personally believe that the latter is more fulfilling, and I would prefer to work for myself and run my own business.One of the most significant advantages of self-employment is the freedom it affords. When you run your own business, you have the autonomy to make critical decisions regarding the direction of your work, the people you collaborate with, and the work-life balance that suits you best. This level of control is often absent when working for a larger organization, where policies and procedures can feel constraining. Additionally, self-employment can provide financial upside, allowing individuals to reap the full benefits of their hard work. This potential for unlimited earnings is often cited as a motivating factor for entrepreneurs.However, it is essential to acknowledge the challenges that come with self-employment. Starting a business involves risks, uncertainty, and requires a significant commitment of time and resources. The safety net of a steady paycheck and employee benefits is indeed enticing, especially in economically turbulent times. Nevertheless, the knowledge that I am building something of my own—a venture that reflects my passion and vision—trumps these concerns for me.Ultimately, while jobs in government and private sectors offer stability, self-employment represents a unique opportunity for creative expression and personal growth. In a rapidly evolving world where innovation and adaptability are highly valued, I firmly believe that pursuing one’s own business endeavors is the path toward true professional fulfillment.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"The expression ""Never, never give up"" embodies a philosophy of perseverance and resilience, encouraging individuals to remain steadfast in pursuing their goals, despite facing failures. I firmly agree with this statement, as the experience of failure is an inherent part of life that often serves as a catalyst for growth and future success.Throughout our lives, many individuals encounter setbacks across various areas, including education, relationships, and professional endeavors. A student might struggle to grasp a challenging concept, a romantic relationship might not work out as hoped, or a business venture could fail to yield anticipated profits. In these instances, some people propose that the most prudent course of action is to forget the setback and move on. This perspective advocates for a clean break from painful experiences, perceiving them as obstacles best left behind. However, I maintain that this approach overlooks the rich lessons that failure can provide. Each setback offers an opportunity for self-reflection and personal growth. When one confronts challenges head-on and learns from them, it can lead to improved strategies and ultimately greater success. For example, many renowned figures have faced significant failures before achieving their dreams: Thomas Edison famously failed thousands of times before creating the lightbulb, yet his determination paved the way for groundbreaking innovations.Moreover, the notion of ""never giving up"" encourages a mindset that values resilience. This tenacity fosters an environment in which individuals learn to adapt and improve, rather than surrender in the face of adversity. Each failed attempt can nurture qualities like grit and determination, which are essential for overcoming future obstacles.In conclusion, while encountering failures can be disheartening, embracing the mantra of persistence and learning from these experiences ultimately leads to growth and success. Rather than abandoning our pursuits in times of difficulty, we should strive to learn, adapt, and continue on the path toward our goals."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;"The debate surrounding human needs versus the preservation of land for endangered animals has become increasingly relevant as the global population continues to rise. While there is no denying the importance of protecting endangered species and their habitats, I believe that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry must take precedence in our decision-making processes.Firstly, as the population increases day by day, so does the demand for food. To sustain a growing population, it is essential to prioritize agricultural development. Farmland is not merely a luxury; it is a necessity for producing food crops to feed our communities. The challenge of global food security is pressing, and the conversion of land for agriculture is vital in addressing hunger and malnutrition. By focusing on efficiency and sustainability in farming practices, it is possible to meet human food demands while also considering ecological factors.Secondly, humans require shelter to protect themselves from natural elements and ensure basic safety. Land is crucial for building housing that provides security and comfort. As cities continue to expand, we must find a balance between urban development and the preservation of green spaces. This can be achieved through innovative urban planning that prioritizes both human shelter and the integration of natural habitats.Lastly, industry plays a crucial role in human comfort and economic development. Factories, technology, and infrastructure are essential for innovation and growth. By meeting the demands of industry, we can create jobs and provide a better quality of life for many people. However, it is important to note that industrial practices should be implemented with environmental considerations in mind.In conclusion, while the conservation of endangered animals is undeniably important, the pressing needs of the human population for food, shelter, and industry must take priority. With thoughtful planning and sustainable practices, we can find a way to meet human needs while still recognizing the significance of preserving our natural world."
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";The age-old adage that one should never judge a person by their external appearance holds profound significance in today’s world, where first impressions frequently matter. While I acknowledge that physical appearance is an aspect of personal identity, I firmly believe that personality is far more significant in determining a person's true character and worth.Individuals possess two primary features: appearance and personality. The former is often the first thing we notice, often shaped by societal norms, trends, and individual choices. Unfortunately, this superficial aspect can create immediate biases, influencing our perceptions and interactions. People may connect beauty with virtue or strength, while overlooking the depth of character residing beneath the surface. This tendency can lead to misjudgments and missed opportunities to understand and appreciate the richness of one's inner self.Conversely, personality encapsulates the essence of who a person is — their values, thoughts, and emotions. Traits such as kindness, integrity, empathy, and humor are what truly define a person, shaping their interactions and relationships. A person may possess physical attributes that align with societal beauty standards, but if they lack the warmth and integrity in their personality, they may fail to inspire or connect with others on a meaningful level.In conclusion, while external appearance can influence first impressions, it is ultimately a person’s personality that reveals their true character. An appealing appearance may attract notice, but genuine connections are fostered through kindness, understanding, and shared values. Therefore, we should strive to look beyond the surface, valuing the unique qualities that make each individual special. In a world rich with diversity, understanding the importance of personality over appearance is essential for fostering empathy and building authentic relationships.
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;The debate over the necessity of a single international language is multifaceted, encapsulating both the benefits of global communication and the intrinsic value of cultural identity. Proponents argue that a universal language could significantly enhance global economic cooperation. In an increasingly interconnected world, businesses operate on a global scale, requiring seamless communication to navigate diverse markets. A common language would minimize barriers, streamline negotiations, and foster collaboration, ultimately boosting economic growth. Moreover, a universal language could facilitate cultural communication and interactions, creating a platform for shared understanding and unity among people of diverse backgrounds. It would enable individuals to engage in cross-cultural dialogues, stimulating innovation and the exchange of ideas. This linguistic commonality could also enhance educational opportunities, allowing individuals to access a broader range of knowledge and cultural insights from around the world.However, the push for a single international language raises valid concerns regarding the preservation of cultural heritage. Language is a fundamental aspect of cultural identity, encapsulating the values, traditions, and historical narratives of its speakers. The eradication of local languages in favor of a dominant global tongue could lead to the loss of unique cultural perspectives and diversity. Each language carries with it a rich tapestry of beliefs and customs that contribute to the global narrative. Consequently, disregarding these languages in pursuit of uniformity could impoverish the world's cultural landscape.In conclusion, while the implementation of a single international language could indeed foster economic cooperation and enhance communication, it is crucial to strike a balance. Every country should prioritize the preservation of its cultural heritage alongside the adoption of a universal language. Embracing both the advantages of global communication and the richness of cultural identity may enable a world where diverse languages coexist, each contributing to a vibrant global society.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;Fashion trends have become a pervasive and influential aspect of modern society. While some individuals advocate for a personal dressing style that reflects one's individuality, I contend that fashion trends play a more essential role in our lives than merely serving as a means to sell clothes. Following these trends allows individuals to remain engaged with the dynamic transformations of the world around them.Firstly, fashion is an ever-evolving reflection of cultural, social, and artistic movements. By keeping abreast of current trends, individuals can stay connected with the zeitgeist—often enhancing their social interactions and networks. Fashion trends often act as a common language, facilitating connections among diverse groups of people. When someone dons a trendy outfit, they project a level of awareness of contemporary culture, signaling to peers that they are in tune with the world.Moreover, trends often serve as a source of inspiration for personal style rather than a strict guideline to follow. Many successful individuals have utilized trends to enhance their unique identity. For instance, trends can encourage experimentation with colors, textures, and silhouettes that individuals might not otherwise consider. In this light, following trends can be viewed as a way to refine personal style rather than abandon it altogether. Additionally, the fashion industry plays a significant role in the economy, providing jobs and stimulating creativity. By engaging with trends, individuals contribute to a cycle that supports artisans, designers, and brands, fostering a vibrant fashion ecosystem.In conclusion, while there is merit in advocating for personal dressing styles, I believe that fashion trends have a more vital role in allowing individuals to connect with broader cultural narratives and maintain relevance. Embracing trends enhances not just individual expression but also fosters community and economic vitality in the ever-changing landscape of fashion.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";The debate on whether wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations often vacillates between moral imperatives and questions of sovereignty. However, there are compelling reasons for wealthy nations to assist those in need, beyond mere altruism. It is fundamentally inhumane to witness fellow humans grappling with famine, poverty, and lack of access to education while others enjoy vast resources. Every day, countless individuals in poorer nations face dire circumstances, and human compassion should stir a sense of urgency for action among those who can help.Prominent among the reasons for wealthy nations to lend a helping hand is the potential for economic mutual benefit. Providing food and education to impoverished regions can foster economic development, creating new markets for goods and services. As these nations improve their socio-economic conditions, they can contribute to the global economy, leading to increased demand for products from wealthier countries. This creates a “win-win” scenario where aid transforms into sustainable growth, benefiting both the giver and the receiver in the long run. For instance, education initiatives can empower local populations, equipping them with skills necessary to participate in global markets.Furthermore, moral responsibility transcends national borders. The interconnectedness of our global society means that the consequences of inaction are felt universally, impacting security, economic stability, and humanitarian issues worldwide. Instead of placing the onus solely on the governments of poorer nations, which may lack the resources or infrastructure for effective governance, collaborative efforts can foster real change. In conclusion, while governments of poorer nations have a crucial role in aiding their citizens, wealthy nations possess both the means and moral obligation to share their fortune. Cultivating a spirit of generosity can ultimately lead to a more equitable and prosperous world for all.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;In the ongoing debate surrounding the allocation of health budgets, there is a compelling argument for diverting a significant portion of funds from treatment to health education and preventative measures. I firmly agree with this statement for several important reasons.Firstly, investing in health education has the potential to create long-term positive effects on future generations. By equipping children and young adults with essential knowledge about nutrition, exercise, and the dangers of substance abuse, we instill healthy habits that can last a lifetime. This proactive approach empowers individuals to make informed choices, thereby reducing the risk of chronic diseases that could burden the healthcare system in the future.Moreover, health education provides individuals with the necessary knowledge to protect themselves from various health risks. For instance, understanding the importance of vaccinations, sanitation, and personal hygiene significantly lowers the rates of infectious diseases. When people are aware of how to avoid health pitfalls, the overall incidence of illnesses decreases, which ultimately minimizes the burden on healthcare facilities.Preventative measures, such as regular health screenings and community health initiatives, contribute significantly to improving the general health state of all citizens. By identifying health issues before they escalate into severe conditions, these measures not only enhance individual well-being but also promote a healthier society as a whole.Finally, the cost-effectiveness of prevention cannot be overstated. The expense of treating advanced diseases is often exorbitant compared to the relatively modest investment required for preventative programs. By rebalancing our health budget, we can significantly reduce long-term healthcare costs and alleviate pressure on medical services.In conclusion, diverting a substantial portion of our health budget towards health education and preventative measures is a strategic approach that promises lasting benefits. By nurturing a well-informed populace, we can lower disease incidence and foster a healthier future for generations to come.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;The influence of news media on people's lives is undeniable and multifaceted. While some observers argue that the pervasive nature of news media has negative consequences, it is essential to recognize the merits it brings to society. Although many people contend that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits, a more nuanced view reveals that news media plays a crucial role in both entertainment and education.One of the primary arguments against the news media's influence is the tendency for sensationalism and misinformation. The rapid dissemination of information, often prioritizing speed over accuracy, can lead to widespread misunderstanding and fear. Moreover, the relentless focus on negative news can contribute to a pessimistic worldview, affecting mental health and societal morale. Critics are right to point out that these aspects can lead to a toxic public discourse, where sensational headlines overshadow factual reporting.However, to dismiss the entire spectrum of news media's contributions would be a misunderstanding of its potential. On a positive note, news media serves as a vital tool for entertainment, providing a diverse range of content that caters to various interests. In addition to entertainment, news media enhances public knowledge and awareness, keeping individuals informed about local and global issues. This access to information fosters critical thinking and encourages civic engagement, allowing people to participate knowledgeably in societal debates.Furthermore, in our increasingly interconnected world, news media brings people together, creating a shared understanding of events and cultures. This sense of community can be a powerful force for social cohesion and collaboration.In conclusion, while it is crucial to remain vigilant about the pitfalls of news media, it would be unfair to characterize its influence solely in negative terms. The entertainment and educational value it provides indicates that its development is largely positive, enriching society and empowering individuals in their everyday lives. Balancing criticism with appreciation for its benefits is essential in understanding the complexity of news media’s role in modern life.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;International sporting occasions, such as the football World Cup, serve as vital platforms for easing international tensions and channeling patriotic sentiments in a manner that fosters healthy competition and camaraderie. The phenomenon of nations uniting to celebrate their athletes reflects a shared appreciation for the spirit of sportsmanship, which emphasizes healthiness, honesty, and fairness. This spirit not only showcases the best of athletic prowess but provides a constructive outlet for pride and rivalry that can counterbalance broader political discord.When nations come together for an event like the World Cup, the atmosphere is often imbued with a sense of shared purpose and mutual respect. The event draws diverse crowds, each displaying their national colors and cheering for their teams, which can transcend political disagreements and foster understanding among different cultures. Such occasions symbolize the potential for unity, as athletes become ambassadors of their countries, promoting ideals of peace and friendship.Moreover, the emotional investment of both athletes and spectators can significantly elevate patriotic feelings. Fans passionately support their teams, expressing national pride in a way that is both positive and inclusive. The experience of witnessing competition on an international stage can galvanize national spirit, providing citizens with a sense of belonging and identity that is both exhilarating and safe.In conclusion, international sporting events play an essential role in alleviating international tensions and fostering positive patriotic emotions. By promoting values of fairness and healthiness, these occasions not only celebrate athletic achievement but also encourage dialogue and friendship among nations, transforming competitive rivalry into a collective celebration of human endeavor. Therefore, I strongly agree that such events are crucial in navigating and perhaps mitigating global discord, creating pathways for unity and understanding through the universal language of sport.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;In many countries, the phenomenon of children engaging in paid work has sparked a significant debate. While some argue that such practices are detrimental and exploitative, others see them as valuable opportunities for learning and personal growth. From my perspective, the benefits of children participating in paid work outweigh the potential drawbacks.In many cultures, children are educated from a young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Engaging in paid work can serve as a practical extension of this education, allowing children to develop essential life skills. By managing their time, earning money, and understanding the value of hard work, children can cultivate a sense of responsibility and maturity that formal education may not fully provide. Such experiences can also instill a strong work ethic, resilience, and the ability to interact with others in a professional setting.However, it is critical to differentiate between suitable work and exploitative labor. Work that is age-appropriate, safe, and structured can offer invaluable lessons. For instance, a child working in a family business or a community garden can learn the fundamentals of teamwork, problem-solving, and financial literacy. Moreover, under proper regulations, these work experiences can complement their education and encourage the development of practical skills.Critics often contend that paid work distracts from academic pursuits and interferes with childhood, yet many children can successfully balance both. Still, it is essential to monitor their work hours and ensure that school remains a priority. Hence, while some forms of child labor are indeed harmful, when approached correctly, engaging children in paid work can foster a strong sense of independence and prepare them for future responsibilities. Ultimately, with appropriate oversight and emphasis on education, I firmly believe that the positive aspects of children participating in paid work significantly outweigh the potential drawbacks.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;In recent years, taking a gap year between high school graduation and the commencement of university studies has become an increasingly common trend, especially in various countries. Young people utilize this time in diverse ways, with many opting to travel the world, while others seek employment opportunities. This practice offers both advantages and disadvantages, which are worth exploring.One significant advantage of taking a gap year is the invaluable life experience that students gain. Traveling exposes young individuals to different cultures, lifestyles, and perspectives, fostering a greater understanding of the world and its diversity. Such exposure can cultivate empathy and adaptability, qualities that are increasingly essential in today's interconnected global landscape. Furthermore, students who travel often develop essential life skills, such as problem-solving and time management, which can significantly enhance their confidence and sense of independence.Similarly, those who choose to work during their gap year can reap substantial benefits. Employment not only provides financial independence but also helps young people acquire practical skills and work experiences that can be advantageous in their future studies or careers. Engaging with the demands of a job environment teaches responsibility, enhances collaboration skills, and improves communication abilities.However, the gap year also has its disadvantages. It can lead to a lack of continuity in academic learning, making it challenging for some students to re-integrate into a structured educational environment after an extended break. For others, the year away may lead to distractions, making it difficult to stay focused on their educational goals. Additionally, financial concerns can become a barrier, as travel and living expenses during this time may not be feasible for every individual.In conclusion, while taking a gap year presents adventure and growth opportunities, it also comes with potential pitfalls. Ultimately, the decision to take a break before university should be carefully considered, taking into account individual circumstances and future aspirations. The right balance can result in a well-rounded and enriching experience, laying a solid foundation for a successful academic and professional life.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills to succeed. Traditional academic institutions, such as universities, provide a structured environment for learning and awarding degrees that are often prerequisites for many careers. However, I agree with the assertion that the qualities a person needs to become successful cannot solely be acquired within these walls. To some extent, formal education lays a foundation for critical thinking, cultural understanding, and technical proficiency, which are invaluable in many fields. These institutions can foster communication skills, analytical abilities, and even networking opportunities that can prove vital in today's job market. Yet, they often focus narrowly on theoretical knowledge, which may not translate into practical skills or adaptiveness to rapidly changing industry demands. As a result, many individuals thrive outside the confines of conventional education. This notion is particularly evident in sectors such as entertainment and sports, where success often relies on talent, creativity, and hard work rather than formal qualifications. Icons ranging from athletes to musicians have shown that persistence, passion, and innovative thinking can propel one to success, often without a university degree. The entertainment industry, in particular, celebrates unique skill sets, which can sometimes exceed what is taught in academic settings.Moreover, self-directed learning through online resources, internships, or hands-on experiences can often equip individuals with practical skills that universities may overlook. Networking, emotional intelligence, and adaptability are crucial qualities that can be nurtured outside traditional academic environments and are equally important for success today.In conclusion, while formal education provides foundational knowledge and skills, it is not the exclusive pathway to success. Therefore, I contend that personal drive, practical experience, and innovation play equally significant roles in shaping a successful individual in today’s world.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";The emergence of technology and the internet has undoubtedly transformed the way people access information and experience art. While it is true that individuals can now view historical objects and artworks through various online platforms, I argue that public museums and art galleries will remain essential even in this digital age.Firstly, the convenience that the internet offers cannot be denied. Many people prefer researching artworks or historical artifacts from the comfort of their homes, allowing them to engage with a vast array of information at their fingertips. Websites and virtual tours have democratized access to culture, making it easier for individuals who may not have the opportunity to visit physical museums due to geographical or financial constraints. This accessibility is a commendable advancement in how society engages with art and history.However, the online experience pales in comparison to the immersive and spiritual experience found in physical museums and galleries. Viewing art from behind a screen limits the audience’s ability to appreciate the nuances of size, texture, and technique. The impact of standing in front of a large painting or an ancient artifact, experiencing it in person, and absorbing the atmosphere of the venue cannot be replicated online. The physical presence of an artwork can evoke emotions and reflections that a mere digital image cannot match, allowing for a deeper connection with the pieces.Moreover, museums and galleries serve as communal spaces where people come together to appreciate culture, participate in discussions, and attend events or workshops. This social interaction enriches the overall experience and fosters a sense of community that cannot be achieved through solitary online exploration.In conclusion, while the internet provides a valuable resource for accessing art and history, public museums and art galleries will continue to play an indispensable role in society. They offer unique, holistic experiences that the digital world simply cannot replicate, ensuring their relevance in our culture for years to come.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;"The role of a jury in a criminal trial is paramount in ensuring justice, and the jury's ability to reach an unbiased verdict hinges on the information presented to them. In jurisdictions like the UK and Australia, the law prohibits jurors from accessing a defendant’s past criminal record. This practice is designed to uphold the principle that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, some lawyers argue that juries should be privy to previous convictions, positing that past behavior can inform future actions.It is crucial to recognize that courts in many countries allow jurors to consider a defendant’s criminal history, which can sometimes lead to a more informed decision. However, this approach carries significant risks, primarily the potential for bias. Many people hold the belief that past actions are indicative of future behavior; this perspective can lead jurors to unfairly prejudge defendants based solely on their prior records. Such biases can undermine the objectivity essential to the jury's deliberation and could result in wrongful convictions.While past behavior may provide context, the particulars of each case should remain the focal point of the jury's considerations. In order to deliver a fair verdict, a jury must base its decision solely on the evidence pertaining to the current charges. Introducing past offenses may cloud this judgment, as jurors might disproportionately weigh the defendant’s history rather than the facts of the current crime.In conclusion, I disagree with the suggestion that juries should have access to a defendant’s past criminal record. Maintaining the principle of a fair trial demands that jurors focus on the case at hand, ensuring that their decisions are rooted in the evidence presented, rather than swayed by prior transgressions. This safeguards the integrity of the judicial process, fostering a justice system that is both fair and impartial."
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;The impact of the Internet on formal education remains a provocative topic, eliciting diverse opinions from educationists. With the ability for university lecturers to upload lectures online, the relevance of attending face-to-face classes has arguably diminished. While some may suggest that this shift is detrimental, I assert that the integration of the Internet into academic study offers considerable advantages that will ultimately shape the future of education.In the near future, the Internet is poised to become an indispensable tool in academic training due to the vast array of benefits it offers. Students now have access to an extensive repository of knowledge, enabling them to supplement their learning with resources beyond the traditional curriculum. Online platforms promote flexible learning arrangements, allowing students to access lectures from anywhere at any time, accommodating diverse learning styles and schedules. This democratization of education is particularly beneficial for non-traditional students who may balance work, family, and study.However, critics of this digital transformation caution against the potential drawbacks. They argue that the reliance on online resources can lead to decreased student engagement and interaction, essential components of a comprehensive educational experience. Additionally, the lack of a structured classroom environment may lead to difficulties in time management and self-discipline among students. Concerns regarding the quality of online content and the risk of misinformation also add weight to the argument against excessive reliance on digital materials.Despite these concerns, the overall impact of the Internet on schooling is largely positive. As technology continues to evolve, it will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping academic discourse and learning methodologies. The challenge lies in finding a balance between traditional and digital approaches to education, ensuring that the benefits of both can be harnessed to create a more effective learning environment. Ultimately, the thoughtful integration of the Internet into formal education promises to enhance the academic experience and better prepare students for a rapidly changing world.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;In the modern world, it is disheartening to acknowledge that a significant number of individuals in undeveloped countries succumb to preventable diseases due to the unaffordability of curative medications. Many patients are not dying from inherently dangerous diseases, but rather from a lack of access to life-saving treatments that are readily available in developed nations. This tragic reality prompts a critical question: should pharmaceutical companies in the developed world be obliged to make medications available at reduced prices to avert unnecessary deaths in poorer countries?Proponents of this idea argue that the disparity in medication access is a moral failing of global health care systems. They contend that no person should suffer or die due to financial constraints, especially when effective treatments exist. By lowering prices, drug companies could significantly alleviate the burden of disease in underserved populations, saving countless lives. The principle of equity in healthcare suggests that everyone, irrespective of their economic standing, should have access to essential medicines.However, critics emphasize that the current pricing of medications reflects the extensive research and development costs, as well as the need for pharmaceutical companies to sustain operations and fund future innovations. The effectiveness and potential benefits of a drug are often accompanied by considerable investments. Thus, it is argued that while affordability is crucial, drug companies must also be incentivized to continue creating new therapies.In conclusion, while the ethical imperative to reduce medicine prices for the sake of saving lives is compelling, it is essential to consider the financial realities surrounding drug development. A balance must be struck where life-saving medications are accessible to those in need without compromising the incentives for pharmaceutical innovation. Collaborative approaches, such as tiered pricing and international partnerships, may offer a viable solution to ensure that no one suffers from a lack of access to essential healthcare.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;In recent years, the awareness regarding the harmful effects of smoking has significantly increased among the general public. This newfound knowledge has placed considerable pressure on both government entities and private sectors to take action against this habit, which is considered one of the leading causes of preventable diseases and premature death worldwide. As a result, many businesses have enacted policies prohibiting smoking within their offices, while several governments have imposed bans on smoking in public places. I fully support these efforts, as they contribute positively to both individual health and the overall image of a nation in the long run.The decision to prohibit smoking in workplaces reflects a commitment to ensuring a healthier environment for employees. Studies have shown that exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to serious health issues, including respiratory diseases and cardiovascular problems. By banning smoking in office premises, businesses not only demonstrate care for their employees' well-being but also reduce the financial burden associated with health care costs in the long term. Moreover, a smoke-free workplace enhances productivity and employee morale, creating a more conducive atmosphere for collaboration and innovation.On a broader level, government restrictions on smoking in public areas help cultivate a society that prioritizes health. These policies discourage smoking behaviors and contribute to a culture of wellness, which can lead to improved public health outcomes. As nations adopt smoke-free laws, they enhance their global image by portraying a commitment to health and social responsibility. Clean public spaces free from smoke can attract tourism and foster community pride.In conclusion, the prohibition of smoking in offices and public areas is a necessary step toward promoting a healthier society. As awareness grows about the dangers of smoking, these measures not only protect individuals but also enhance the collective well-being and reputation of a nation, ensuring a healthier future for generations to come.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";"The debate surrounding the human impact on Earth is both intricate and pressing. While some argue that our activities are detrimental to the planet, I firmly believe that we are harming the Earth through our actions. The phrase ""Save the planet Earth"" becomes increasingly relevant as we witness environmental degradation manifest in alarming ways.One of the most critical concerns is the significant emissions of carbon monoxide and other greenhouse gases from various sources, including refrigerants from air conditioners. The widespread use of these devices has been linked to the depletion of the ozone layer, which serves as a protective shield against harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. By compromising this layer, we not only endanger countless species but also threaten our own health and well-being. Increased UV exposure can lead to higher rates of skin cancer and other health issues, showcasing a direct link between our comfort and our environmental responsibility.Furthermore, our relentless consumption and production patterns contribute to pollution, deforestation, and climate change. The extraction of natural resources for industrial purposes leaves scars on the landscape, disrupts ecosystems, and diminishes biodiversity. This not only harms wildlife but also destabilizes the delicate balance that sustains life on our planet. As habitats are destroyed, species are driven to extinction, ultimately diminishing the quality of life for future generations.While some may argue that technological advancements and urban development improve living conditions, these benefits often come at a steep environmental cost. We must critically evaluate whether our pursuits truly enhance life on Earth or simply offer short-term conveniences that threaten the long-term viability of our planet.In conclusion, the evidence is overwhelming that human activities are causing irreparable harm to Earth. It is imperative that we prioritize sustainability and environmental stewardship to ensure a healthier planet for ourselves and generations to come. ""Saving the planet Earth"" is not just a slogan; it is a call to action that we must heed before it is too late."
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The debate surrounding the retirement of older employees to create opportunities for younger generations is a contentious one. While some argue that companies should encourage employees over 55 to retire, I firmly disagree. Sacrificing the experience and wisdom of senior members can lead to several negative consequences, both in terms of workplace culture and broader societal impacts.First and foremost, the mass retirement of older employees can foster a sense of unfairness between generations. It creates a narrative of ageism, where the value of an employee is determined solely by their age rather than their skills, knowledge, or contributions to the company. This perception not only demoralizes older workers but also sets a troubling precedent for younger employees. Instead of cultivating an environment where everyone can learn from one another, it engenders a divide, breeding resentment and competition rather than collaboration.Moreover, encouraging senior employees to retire prematurely might place a significant financial burden on local governments. Many older workers contribute to social security and other local programs through their taxes. Forcing them out of the workforce can diminish the tax base and increase the strain on pension funds. The influx of newly unemployed older individuals may also lead to higher unemployment rates and increased reliance on social services, ultimately impacting the economy as a whole.In conclusion, while the intention to provide opportunities for younger generations is commendable, promoting policies that disproportionately affect older employees is not the solution. Rather than pushing them toward retirement, businesses should focus on fostering a culture of mentorship, where the expertise of older professionals can be shared, benefiting both younger workers and the organization itself. Embracing diversity in age can lead to a more inclusive and productive workplace for all.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;"The debate surrounding the appropriate level of control exerted over mass media—including newspapers, television, and the internet—has gained significant traction in recent years. Advocates for tighter media control argue that such measures are necessary to shield the public from harmful content, while opponents argue for greater freedom of access to information. One of the prominent arguments in favor of stricter media regulation is to limit the exposure of audiences, particularly impressionable youths, to violent and sexual content. In an age where television and online platforms deliver an overwhelming amount of media, unchecked exposure can have detrimental effects on viewers, leading to desensitization towards violence or the normalization of inappropriate sexual behavior. Proponents maintain that regulations can mitigate these risks, fostering a healthier cultural environment.Furthermore, the influx of foreign programming into local media landscapes raises concerns about the susceptibility of audiences to adopt alien ideologies. As television companies import various foreign shows, they often come with cultural narratives and perspectives that may not align with local values. This cross-cultural influence could inadvertently lead to shifts in societal norms that may not be beneficial for the audience.On the flip side, the major argument for loosening media controls is the necessity of protecting citizens' right to access information freely. An informed populace is foundational to a vibrant democracy, and imposed restrictions can lead to a slippery slope of censorship, where information deemed ""inappropriate"" is suppressed regardless of its actual impact. Additionally, unrestricted access to diverse viewpoints encourages critical thinking and fosters a well-rounded understanding of global issues.In conclusion, while there are valid points on both sides, I align more with the argument for lesser controls on media. The benefits of protecting freedom of expression and access to information far outweigh the potential risks, provided that media literacy and responsible consumption are encouraged within society."
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;The debate surrounding the role of citizenship and its responsibilities is a complex issue that elicits diverse opinions. Some individuals maintain that paying taxes is the sole responsibility of citizens, asserting that financial contributions to the government suffice in supporting societal functions. However, I align with those who argue that citizenship encompasses a broader range of responsibilities that go beyond mere monetary contributions.Fundamentally, paying taxes is a vital aspect of civic duty as it allows the government to fund essential services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. However, taxation alone does not encapsulate the essence of being a good citizen. True contribution to society requires adherence to laws and regulations imposed by the government. Laws are designed not only to maintain order but also to protect the rights and welfare of all individuals within a community. By obeying these laws, citizens actively foster a stable and harmonious environment that benefits everyone.Furthermore, citizens have a responsibility to protect and cherish the culture and history of their country. Cultural heritage shapes national identity and fosters a sense of belonging and unity among people. By engaging in community events, supporting local traditions, and promoting cultural awareness, citizens can contribute to the preservation of their nation's legacy. This active involvement enriches society and ensures that future generations remain connected to their roots.In conclusion, while paying taxes is undoubtedly an essential component of citizenship, it is not sufficient on its own. Being an engaged citizen involves a broader commitment that includes obeying laws and actively participating in cultural preservation. Engaging in these responsibilities fosters a vibrant, cohesive society that ultimately contributes to the development and well-being of a nation.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;The debate surrounding animal testing is a contentious one, with proponents arguing for its necessity in scientific advancement, while opponents contend that it is unethical and should be made illegal. I firmly agree that animal testing should be banned due to the ethical implications and the inefficacy of this practice.While it is true that numerous medical treatments, including breakthroughs in cancer and HIV drugs, have been discovered through animal testing, this should not overshadow the moral considerations involved. The fundamental issue lies in the fact that animals used in testing often endure severe suffering and are kept in unnatural and stressful conditions. These environments fail to replicate the animals' natural habitats, leading to psychological and physical distress.Moreover, the assertion that animal testing is indispensable disregards the advancements in alternative research methods. Technologies such as in vitro testing, computer modeling, and organs-on-chips offer more humane and relevant ways to study disease and test drug efficacy. These methods not only eliminate the ethical concerns associated with animal suffering but also often yield results that are more applicable to human health. Indeed, significant discrepancies exist between animal models and human responses, which raises serious questions about the reliability and applicability of animal testing results.Additionally, the costs associated with maintaining animal testing facilities, as well as the ethical and legal ramifications of using sentient beings for experimentation, suggests that the overall benefits do not justify the ongoing practice. The scientific community should focus on transitioning to modern methodologies that align with ethical standards while still promoting medical and scientific advancements.In conclusion, the practice of testing on animals should be banned. The moral implications, combined with the emergence of alternative research techniques and the ethical ramifications associated with animal suffering, render animal testing an outdated and unnecessary practice in today’s society. It is time for progress to move forward without the exploitation of sentient beings.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";"Examinations have long been a cornerstone in educational systems worldwide, serving as a key method for assessing student learning and achievement. However, ongoing debates suggest that the traditional approach of formal ""pen and paper"" examinations may not be the most effective means of evaluating a student's capabilities. While exams have distinct advantages, it is prudent to reconsider their role in education.One of the primary benefits of examinations lies in their ability to create standardized conditions for all candidates. By administering tests under uniform circumstances, exams promote fairness and equality. Every student is given the same opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, which is crucial for maintaining academic integrity. This standardization can help ensure that assessments are based on merit rather than subjective interpretations of performance.However, there are substantial drawbacks to relying solely on examinations. They often emphasize rote memorization rather than critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are vital in today's rapidly changing world. Students may become adept at ""cramming"" for tests, leading to superficial learning that does not translate to long-term knowledge retention. Furthermore, exams can induce significant stress and anxiety, hindering performance and discouraging a genuine love for learning. Additionally, the emphasis on a single assessment can overlook diverse talents and learning styles. Students who may excel in practical applications or creative thinking might struggle in formal exam settings, which can perpetuate a narrow definition of success. In conclusion, while formal examinations provide a standardized method for assessing educational achievement, it is essential to recognize their limitations. Educational systems should consider incorporating alternative assessment strategies, such as project-based evaluations, collaborative group work, and oral presentations. By diversifying assessment methods, we can create a more holistic understanding of student achievement, fostering a learning environment that nurtures both knowledge and critical thinking skills."
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;Improvements in health, education, and trade are crucial for the development of poorer nations. These factors are interlinked and play a fundamental role in establishing a foundation for sustainable growth. A healthy population is more productive and better able to contribute to economic development. Similarly, education equips individuals with the skills necessary for participating in an increasingly complex global economy. Trade enhances income opportunities and fosters connectivity with other markets, all of which are fundamental for improving the standard of living in developing regions.However, impoverished nations often lack the resources required to implement substantial improvements in these areas. Therefore, it falls upon the governments of richer nations to take more responsibility for facilitating growth and development. One tangible way they can contribute is by delegating healthcare professionals, such as doctors and nurses, to work in under-resourced areas. This would not only address immediate health care shortages but also provide valuable training and mentoring for local healthcare workers. Furthermore, donations for building hospitals and healthcare facilities in poorer regions can significantly improve health outcomes.In the realm of education, richer nations can extend their support by offering scholarships and loans to qualified students from developing countries. This would provide these individuals with the opportunity to access higher education, equipping them with the necessary skills to contribute to their nation's development. Through such scholarships, students can attain knowledge and qualifications that are often unavailable in their home countries, fostering a new generation of educated professionals ready to lead economic and social advancement.In conclusion, while improvements in health, education, and trade are vital for the development of poorer nations, richer countries must embrace their role in fostering this growth by providing essential resources, knowledge, and opportunities. Through collaboration and support, the global community can work towards a more equitable and prosperous world for all.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;"As computers become increasingly integrated into education, the role of teachers is often called into question. While technology undoubtedly enhances the learning experience, asserting that teachers will soon become obsolete is an oversimplification. I firmly disagree with the notion that educators will have no role in the classroom in the near future. Firstly, teachers fulfill multifaceted roles that extend far beyond merely delivering content. They act as friends and confidants, offering emotional support and guidance to students during critical developmental stages. The relationship between a teacher and a student fosters a sense of security and belonging, which a computer cannot replicate. While digital platforms can provide information and resources, they lack the capability to understand and respond to the nuanced emotional and social needs of individual students. This human connection is vital for effective learning, as it encourages students to engage more deeply with the material and to seek help when needed.Moreover, teachers serve as role models, imparting values and life skills alongside the subject matter. They inspire, motivate, and challenge students to realize their potential, which is a profoundly human interaction rooted in personal experience and empathy. A computer may assist in the dissemination of knowledge, but it cannot provide the same level of mentorship or nuanced guidance that a trained educator offers.In addition, classrooms are dynamic environments where collaboration, discussion, and critical thinking thrive. Teachers facilitate these interactions, prompting students to engage with one another in ways that foster teamwork and communication skills. Computers may aid in administering lessons, but the unpredictable and rich nature of human interaction is irreplaceable.In conclusion, while technology will continue to play a vital role in education, teachers' unique abilities to connect with, inspire, and guide students cannot be replaced. They are not just dispensers of knowledge; they are mentors, friends, and catalysts for personal growth in the classroom. The presence of teachers remains essential for a holistic educational experience."
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;The advent of advanced fertilizers and state-of-the-art machinery has revolutionized agricultural practices, promising a means of significantly reducing production costs. The incorporation of improved plant foods along with newly developed devices has led to increased crop yields, enabling farmers to produce more food at lower expenses. This trend is essential in meeting the growing global demand for food, particularly in regions experiencing rapid population growth. However, while the financial benefits are undeniable, the ramifications of relying heavily on these high-tech solutions warrant serious consideration.One of the primary concerns surrounding the use of high-tech fertilizers is their potential threat to human health. Many synthetic fertilizers contain harmful chemicals that can contaminate soil and water supplies, posing risks to those who consume the products grown using these methods. The long-term effects of exposure to such substances can lead to severe health issues, including respiratory problems, allergies, and even cancer.Moreover, an excessive dependence on electronic machinery for harvesting and other agricultural tasks can have detrimental impacts on local communities. As automation replaces traditional farming practices, there is a potential for significant job losses. Many rural workers are left without employment, which can lead to economic instability and increased inequality within these communities. Furthermore, the increased use of technology may diminish traditional knowledge and practices that are culturally significant and sustainable.In conclusion, while improved fertilizers and sophisticated machinery can lead to cost-effective food production, it is paramount to balance these advancements with considerations for human health and community welfare. Sustainable agricultural practices should be prioritized, integrating modern innovations without sacrificing the well-being of individuals or the social fabric of local communities. Moving forward, a holistic approach that safeguards both health and employment is essential for the future of agriculture.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;The debate regarding governmental funding for the arts often yields divided opinions. Some argue that public money would be better spent on more pressing issues, such as healthcare, education, or infrastructure. However, I firmly disagree with this perspective for several compelling reasons.Firstly, art significantly enhances the quality of life in society. It surrounds us in various forms—visual arts, music, literature, and performance—enriching our daily experiences and nurturing our well-being. Art has the power to provoke thought, evoke emotions, and foster a sense of community and belonging. It can elevate public spaces, creating environments that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and inspiring. By investing in the arts, governments help cultivate a culture that values creativity and expression, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and engaged society.Moreover, the arts play a crucial role in attracting tourists. Cities known for their artistic heritage, such as Paris, Florence, and New York, draw millions of visitors each year, significantly boosting local economies. Tourists seek cultural experiences that often revolve around museums, galleries, and live performances. Consequently, government support for the arts can yield substantial financial returns through tourism, creating jobs and supporting local businesses, which can, in turn, alleviate some of the challenges in other areas such as unemployment and economic stagnation.In conclusion, while it is essential for governments to address critical social issues, neglecting the arts is not a viable solution. The impact of art on our lives, society, and economy is profound. Cultivating a vibrant artistic culture is a responsibility that should be shared, as it enriches the human experience and fosters a thriving community. Therefore, I believe that continued funding for artists is not only justified but also essential.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The rapid development of technology over the past few decades has played a crucial role in shaping modern society. However, it has also led to significant environmental challenges, prompting diverse opinions on the best way to address these issues. Some advocate for a return to simpler living, arguing that a reduction in technological dependence is essential for environmental preservation. Others, however, contend that further advancements in technology itself can provide the solutions needed to combat these environmental problems.Proponents of a simpler lifestyle often believe that reducing our reliance on technology can mitigate its negative impact on the environment. They argue that by embracing minimalism and nature-centric practices, society could decrease resource depletion, pollution, and carbon emissions. This viewpoint emphasizes a more sustainable way of living that respects natural ecosystems and fosters a profound connection with the environment. In their view, reverting to simpler methods might allow for a healthier planet and a more fulfilled human experience.Conversely, many believe in technology’s inherent capacity to address environmental concerns. Innovations in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and waste management have already shown promise in combating climate change and reducing ecological harm. For instance, advancements in solar and wind energy technologies have the potential to significantly lower carbon footprints and replace fossil fuels. Supporters of this view argue that by investing in engineering and tech solutions, we can create a more sustainable future without sacrificing modern conveniences.In my opinion, while adopting a simpler lifestyle may contribute to mitigating environmental issues, it is not a feasible solution for the broader population in today’s context. Instead, harnessing the power of technology presents a more practical path forward. By continuing to innovate and implement eco-friendly technologies, society can work towards sustainable development that addresses environmental challenges while maintaining quality of life. Balancing both approaches—promoting a conscious lifestyle alongside leveraging technological advancements—might indeed be the most effective way to combat environmental problems.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The debate over whether professional athletes and entertainers are overpaid has been a contentious issue in society. On one hand, some argue that their extravagant salaries, often reaching into the millions each year, are justified by their exceptional talents and the entertainment they provide. These individuals possess skills that are rare and often the result of years of hard work and dedication. For example, a football star might spend countless hours training to excel at their sport while also handling the pressures that come with fame and high expectations. Fans find emotional and social connections through these athletes and entertainers, making their income feel somewhat justifiable.However, the other side of the argument posits that the compensation these individuals receive is disproportionate to their contributions to society. Critics highlight that while athletes and entertainers certainly bring joy and entertainment, their impact on social development may be minimal compared to professions such as teachers, healthcare workers, or scientists. A school teacher, for instance, plays a vital role in shaping future generations and often earns a fraction of what a top athlete makes in a single game. The prioritization of entertainment over education and essential services raises questions about societal values.Moreover, some contend that excessive salaries are indicative of a society that overly values recreation and spectacle at the expense of meaningful contributions. For example, when a million-dollar contract is signed for a single athlete, many question the rationale behind such financial disparities, particularly in contexts where many individuals are struggling to make ends meet. In conclusion, while the exceptional abilities of athletes and entertainers may warrant high incomes, the disparities between their earnings and those of essential workers challenge the fairness of their compensation in relation to their societal contributions.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;The debate regarding the significance of computers and the Internet in children's education compared to traditional schooling is increasingly relevant in our technology-dominated era. Proponents of digital education argue that computers and the Internet are poised to supplant the traditional role of teachers in the near future. Central to their argument is the notion that the global online network serves as an inexhaustible reservoir of information. With just a few clicks, students can access vast resources spanning every conceivable subject, making learning more flexible and personalized. This accessibility encourages self-directed learning, allowing children to explore topics that interest them at their own pace.However, critics of this perspective assert that, while the educational benefits of the Internet are substantial, there remain critical shortcomings that cannot be overlooked. For one, the vast amount of information available online can be overwhelming and difficult to navigate, leading to information overload or the spread of misinformation. Furthermore, the Internet cannot replicate the social interactions and collaborative learning experiences that occur in a traditional classroom setting. Schools provide structured environments where students learn not only academic content but also essential life skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.In my opinion, a balanced approach that combines the strengths of both traditional schooling and digital resources is optimal for children's education. While computers and the Internet undoubtedly enhance learning opportunities, they should complement rather than replace the essential role of teachers. Educators are indispensable in guiding students through the wealth of information available online, fostering critical thinking, and nurturing social skills. Thus, the future of education should embrace technology while ensuring that the human element remains at the core of learning experiences.
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";"Capital punishment, or the death penalty, has long been a topic of fierce debate among nations and societies. Proponents argue that it serves as a deterrent to violent crimes, while opponents emphasize the ethical implications and potential for wrongful convictions. In examining the necessity of the death penalty in controlling violent crime, one must consider both its retributive aspects and the evolving perceptions of human rights.Supporters of capital punishment often contend that the ultimate punishment for heinous crimes serves to dissuade potential offenders from engaging in violent behavior. In a world rife with brutal crimes, many believe that the death penalty acts as an effective deterrent. The idea is simple: if individuals know that the consequence of their actions could ultimately lead to their own death, the fear of such a fate may prevent them from engaging in criminal activities. This argument, while germane, does not take into account the complexity of human behavior and the myriad reasons behind criminal acts, which might not be effectively addressed by fear alone.However, as society evolves, so do its values. Human rights and the sanctity of life have become paramount in modern discourse. The notion of ""murdering"" criminals, regardless of their offenses, raises profound ethical questions. Is it morally justifiable for the state to take a life, even in retribution for brutal crimes? Furthermore, the risk of executing an innocent person – a reality highlighted by numerous cases of wrongful convictions – underscores the inherent flaws in a system that allows for capital punishment.In conclusion, while there may be arguments supporting the death penalty as a means to control violent crime, it is necessary to weigh these against the moral considerations and potential injustices involved. As a society, we must strive for justice that respects human rights and seeks rehabilitation over retribution. The future of criminal justice should prioritize preventing crime through sociocultural reforms rather than resorting to capital punishment."
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;The statement that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit raises important ethical questions regarding the balance between profit-making and ethical responsibility. While it is undeniably true that companies, factories, and businesses are established to meet the needs of consumers while generating profits for their owners and managers, unchecked pursuit of profit can have detrimental consequences for society and the environment.Without appropriate oversight and regulation, businesses may engage in harmful practices that threaten not only human health but also the well-being of animals and the natural world. For instance, companies may prioritize short-term financial gain over sustainable practices. This could lead to excessive pollution, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor. A notable example is the textile industry, where fast fashion brands may resort to environmentally damaging production methods and exploit workers to minimize costs and maximize profits. Additionally, if companies are allowed to operate without limits in their pursuit of profit, they may produce products with substandard quality, putting consumers at risk. In many instances, businesses may capitalize on the lack of stringent regulations to offer lower-quality goods at higher prices, leading to consumer deception. This not only damages public trust but also creates a cycle where consumers are forced to spend more money on replacements for defective products.In conclusion, while the primary goal of businesses is to generate profits, it is vital to recognize that they must also adhere to ethical standards and environmental considerations. A balanced approach that prioritizes not only profits but also social responsibility is essential for the long-term sustainability of businesses. Hence, I disagree with the idea that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit, as this could lead to significant harm to individuals and the planet.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;The recent announcement regarding the construction of a new high school in our neighborhood is an exciting opportunity for our community, and I wholeheartedly support this plan. Our current high school, while historically significant to our district, is aging and falls short when it comes to essential amenities and resources that are vital for modern education. Students today require facilities that foster innovation, creativity, and collaboration. Regrettably, the old high school often struggles to provide adequate technology, safe spaces for group work, and updated classrooms that reflect current educational standards.The establishment of a new high school not only promises to address these pressing deficiencies but also serves as a catalyst for fostering connections between students from different communities and districts within our city. A contemporary school building can become a melting pot of diverse backgrounds, where students can interact, learn from one another, and develop a broader understanding of the world. This diversity will enrich the educational experience, helping to cultivate tolerance and mutual respect among peers.Moreover, a new high school can offer extracurricular activities and programs that our current institution cannot fully support due to its limitations. Facilities such as science laboratories, art studios, and sports complexes can enhance students' opportunities to explore their interests and talents. Additionally, leveraging modern technology and learning environments will better prepare our youth for the dynamic demands of the 21st-century workforce.In conclusion, I firmly believe that building a new high school in our neighborhood will yield significant benefits not only for the students but for the entire community. It represents a proactive step toward improving educational standards, fostering inclusivity, and shaping a brighter future for all students in our city. Therefore, I am in full support of this plan.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;The debate over whether parents or adult relatives should make important decisions for their teenage children, particularly those aged 15 to 18, is a contentious one. While striving for independence is a significant aspect of this age group, I agree that parental involvement is crucial for several reasons.Firstly, teenagers are still in a transitional phase, requiring guidance in navigating the complexities of life. Adolescence is marked by heightened emotions and uncertainties regarding identity, relationships, and future aspirations. In comparison to older adults, teenagers often lack the experience necessary to make informed decisions, which can lead to costly mistakes, both financially and emotionally. For instance, decisions regarding education, friendships, and career paths can be critically impactful, and having adult relatives to assist in this process can provide necessary stability.Moreover, parents and guardians possess a wealth of experience and knowledge that can serve as a valuable advisory resource. They have often faced similar challenges during their youth and can offer insights that are applicable to their children’s circumstances. By making decisions collaboratively or guiding their teenagers through the decision-making process, parents can help them identify potential pitfalls and consider the long-term implications of their choices.In addition, parental involvement can lead to the conservation of valuable resources such as time and money. For example, parents may have a clearer understanding of educational routes that lead to sustainable careers, helping their children avoid academically or financially detrimental paths. With the rising costs of education and living expenses, making informed decisions early on is essential for ensuring a solid foundation for the future.In conclusion, while fostering independence is essential for teenagers, the insightful guidance of parents and adult relatives is invaluable. Their experience can illuminate the right path and ultimately equip teens with the skills necessary to make informed decisions as they transition into adulthood.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;"Childhood is often described as the happiest time of a person's life, and I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment for two primary reasons. Firstly, children experience a remarkable sense of freedom that is rarely matched in later stages of life. Unlike adults, who grapple with responsibilities and societal expectations, children can explore their interests freely. Their days are filled with play, creativity, and imagination, allowing them to engage in activities purely for enjoyment. This unrestricted freedom fosters a sense of adventure and discovery, as they can dive into anything from riding bikes to crafting elaborate stories or simply playing with friends. Such liberating experiences contribute significantly to their happiness and overall emotional well-being.In addition to the freedom they enjoy, children are blessed with an abundance of time. Unlike adults, who often juggle educational and career responsibilities, children are primarily focused on learning through play and exploration. They do not have the added stress of work or extensive commitments; their main obligation is often simply to learn and grow. This lack of external pressures allows children to savor the moments of life, cultivating a carefree attitude that many adults long for. Whether it's spending hours at a park, devouring books, or engaging in imaginative play, the ample free time that children possess enables them to create joy and fond memories.In summary, childhood stands out as a truly exceptional phase of life. The unmistakable freedom from constraints and the luxury of time to explore and enjoy life contribute to an unparalleled sense of happiness during these formative years. As we transition into adulthood, the responsibilities and complexities of life can overshadow these simple pleasures, making childhood memories even more precious."
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;Attending college and university is a pivotal chapter in many individuals’ lives, serving as a foundational step toward personal and professional development. While the motivations for higher education may vary widely among students, several key reasons are commonly cited.First and foremost, universities are ideal environments for cultivating an individual's understanding of various subjects. Here, students are introduced to complex theories and diverse perspectives across a multitude of disciplines. For instance, a student studying environmental science may engage in critical discussions about climate change, enhancing their comprehension of the intricate relationship between society and the environment. This intellectual development fosters critical thinking skills that are essential in today’s fast-paced, ever-changing world.Another essential function of university education is career preparation. Higher education institutions equip students with not only theoretical knowledge but practical skills that are crucial for success in the job market. Programs are designed around industry needs, thus ensuring that students are well-prepared for their chosen careers upon graduation. For example, a student pursuing a degree in nursing will gain hands-on experience through clinical placements that help bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application.Moreover, engagement in volunteer work and internships is increasingly recognized as integral to a comprehensive university experience. While completing homework and attending lectures form the academic backbone, participating in volunteer activities allows students to develop soft skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication. Internships, on the other hand, provide invaluable on-the-job experience, making students more competitive candidates for employment after graduation. In conclusion, people attend college and university for a multitude of reasons, primarily to enhance their understanding of various subjects, prepare for future careers, and actively engage in real-world experiences through internships and volunteer work. This multifaceted approach to education not only enriches students academically but also cultivates well-rounded individuals ready to contribute to society.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;The debate surrounding the value of close friendships versus having a large number of casual acquaintances is a topic that often elicits varied opinions. However, I firmly agree that it is better to have one or two close friends than to maintain a large circle of casual acquaintances. The significance of a friend lies not merely in the number of connections one has but in the depth of those relationships. A close friend is someone with whom you can share your innermost thoughts, fears, and aspirations. This level of intimacy fosters a strong emotional bond and provides a sense of security and trust that is often missing in casual friendships. When life presents challenges, having a friend to rely on can be invaluable. They can offer support, advice, and perspective during difficult times, helping to lighten burdens that might feel insurmountable on one’s own.In contrast, while numerous casual acquaintances can provide a wide array of social interactions, these relationships often lack the emotional depth necessary for true companionship. Casual acquaintances may be enjoyable to engage with in light-hearted conversations, but they usually do not offer the support or understanding that comes from a deep friendship. Moreover, maintaining superficial relationships can be exhausting and might leave an individual feeling isolated, despite being surrounded by many.Ultimately, the true essence of friendship lies in mutual care and understanding. A close friend invests time and emotions into the relationship, creating a bond that can withstand the test of time. While social networks may vary, I believe that the quality of friendships trumps quantity. One or two close friends can provide a sanctuary of understanding and unconditional support, making them far more valuable than a multitude of casual acquaintances. This deeper connection enriches life experiences, making them more fulfilling and meaningful.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";The statement that life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when our grandparents were children is frequently debated. While advancements in technology and convenience have transformed how we live, I disagree with this assertion. In my opinion, life in the old days brought more happiness to people for several reasons, including simplicity, environmental integrity, and the pace of life.First and foremost, life was simpler in the past. Our grandparents experienced a world where basic needs were prioritized, often leading to meaningful interactions and deeper connections within their communities. They engaged in face-to-face conversations, participated in communal activities, and were more closely knit with family. In contrast, today's digital age, while offering vast information and instant communication, often results in superficial connections that can leave individuals feeling isolated.Moreover, the environment today is seriously damaged due to industrialization, pollution, and climate change. Our grandparents interacted with nature differently, often spending time outdoors and appreciating their surroundings in ways that many people today may not. The nostalgia for simpler, cleaner environments cannot be underestimated, as nature has the power to rejuvenate the spirit and promote mental well-being. The degradation of our planet not only impacts our physical world but also contributes to growing anxiety and a sense of urgency that many people feel today.Lastly, the pace of life has become frenetic. In the past, daily life allowed for a slower, more reflective existence. Our grandparents were accustomed to taking the time to savor moments, whether through family dinners or leisurely walks. In today's fast-paced environment, we are often overwhelmed with responsibilities, schedules, and the relentless demands of work and technology, leaving little room for relaxation and introspection.In conclusion, life today, despite its conveniences, is marked by complexity, environmental degradation, and a frantic pace that can detract from true happiness. The simplicity, environmental integrity, and slower rhythm of life experienced by our grandparents resulted in a profound sense of fulfillment and joy that is often lacking in the contemporary world.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;High school is a crucial period in a student's life, as it serves as a foundation for future career choices and personal interests. Allowing students to select the courses they wish to study is essential for several reasons. I firmly agree that high schools should provide this freedom of choice, as it promotes student engagement, improves academic performance, and helps individuals discover their true aptitudes.First and foremost, giving students the autonomy to choose their own courses fosters a sense of responsibility and ownership over their education. When students have the opportunity to study subjects that resonate with their interests, they are more likely to engage actively in class, participate in discussions, and complete assignments with enthusiasm. This intrinsic motivation can transform learning from a mere obligation into an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.Moreover, when students are allowed to select courses aligned with their passions, it often leads to better academic performance. Students are more likely to excel in subjects they find intriguing, translating to higher grades and a deeper understanding of the material. This, in turn, can boost their confidence, paving the way for future academic pursuits and career opportunities. A curriculum that respects student choice ultimately creates a more dynamic and stimulating educational environment.Additionally, high school is an essential time for students to explore their strengths and weaknesses. By offering a variety of course options, students can narrow down their interests and discover aptitudes they may not have realized they possessed. This exploration provides invaluable insights into potential career paths, allowing them to make informed decisions about their future.In conclusion, permitting high school students to choose their courses fosters a more engaging and effective educational experience. It promotes personal responsibility, enhances academic performance, and encourages students to explore their potential. By allowing freedom of choice in their education, we empower young individuals to chart their own paths and ultimately prepare them for successful futures.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";In today’s fast-paced world, individuals often find themselves divided into two distinct categories: those who are always in a hurry to complete tasks and those who prefer to take their time and savor life at a slower pace. After deeply pondering this issue, I find myself gravitating towards the first group, appreciating the benefits of urgency and efficiency in our daily lives.The first and foremost reason for my preference is the inevitable need to save time in order to accomplish significant tasks. Life is filled with responsibilities, deadlines, and commitments that demand our attention. In a world that often prioritizes productivity, being in a rush can enable us to maximize our time and accomplish more. For instance, in my academic life, I often prioritize completing assignments promptly to allow for revision and a deeper understanding of the material. This efficiency not only helps me maintain high grades but also equips me with the skills to manage multiple commitments, such as extracurricular activities or part-time jobs. Another equally important aspect is that keeping a high pace can prevent me from becoming complacent or lazy. Embracing a hurried mentality encourages a sense of vitality and motivation that propels me to achieve my goals. The adrenaline rush from pressing deadlines often enhances my focus, inspiring creative problem-solving. For example, during a particularly demanding week, I’ve found that maintaining a busy schedule helps me prioritize my time better and leverage moments of downtime for relaxation, rather than engaging in overly leisurely distractions.In conclusion, while some people find peace in a slower lifestyle, I prefer the energizing pace of urgency. The ability to accomplish important tasks efficiently while staying motivated ensures I remain productive and engaged in life’s myriad opportunities. Ultimately, embracing a hurried mindset allows us not just to get things done, but to do so with purpose and intention.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;"Tourism is indeed a multibillion-dollar industry that plays a crucial role in spurring economic development worldwide. It offers substantial financial benefits to local economies by attracting visitors who spend money on services like hotels, restaurants, and entertainment. In many regions, particularly those rich in natural beauty or cultural heritage, tourism can be a primary source of income. The influx of tourists creates direct jobs in retail, hospitality, and transport, while also generating indirect employment in sectors such as agriculture and the service industry. This interconnectedness significantly enhances the livelihoods of local communities.However, the rapid growth of tourism often raises concerns about environmental and cultural degradation. Critics argue that the surge in visitors can lead to overexploitation of natural resources, harming ecosystems and wildlife. For example, places like the Galápagos Islands and Venice are grappling with the adverse effects of mass tourism, including pollution and habitat destruction. Furthermore, the cultural impact of tourism cannot be overlooked; the commercialization of local customs and traditions can dilute the authentic identity of communities. In some cases, cultural sites may be altered or exploited to cater to tourist expectations, which can lead to the loss of heritage and local pride.In conclusion, while tourism undeniably contributes to economic development and job creation, it is essential to balance these benefits against the potential harm to the environment and local culture. Sustainable tourism practices should be prioritized to minimize the negative impacts. This approach can involve promoting eco-friendly travel options, enforcing limits on visitor numbers in sensitive areas, and respecting local customs and practices. By striking this balance, we can ensure that tourism supports economic growth without compromising the integrity of local environments and cultures."
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;"The issue of governmental financing for aesthetic features in society has sparked a heated debate. Some argue that budget allocations to the arts, including music, painting, and other creative disciplines, represent a waste of national resources that should instead be dedicated to essential public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. While I understand the arguments made by proponents of this position, I contend that investing in the arts is not only valuable but also in the best interest of society as a whole.Firstly, the arts contribute significantly to the cultural and emotional fabric of society. They foster creativity, encourage critical thinking, and allow individuals to express themselves in unique ways. A society that values artistic expression is likely to be more open-minded and innovative in its approaches to various challenges. Furthermore, exposure to diverse art forms can cultivate empathy among citizens, promoting social cohesion and reducing cultural divides.Secondly, investment in the arts can yield substantial economic benefits. Arts and culture generate jobs and stimulate local economies, often attracting tourism and boosting related industries. For instance, vibrant art scenes can revitalize communities, making them more attractive to businesses and residents alike. Therefore, the argument that funding for the arts is a financial burden neglects the potential for economic growth and community development that can stem from such investments.Lastly, public services and the arts are not mutually exclusive; they can coexist and support one another. A well-rounded society benefits from access to both essential services and cultural enrichment. By funding the arts, the government not only enhances public life but also empowers citizens, giving them a sense of pride and identity.In conclusion, rather than viewing funding for the arts as a diversion of resources, we should recognize it as an essential component of a flourishing society. The enrichment of cultural life complements and enhances public services, creating a holistic approach to fostering a robust and thriving community."
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";The notion of a single, steadfast career path has increasingly become a relic of the past, giving way to a more fluid model of employment characterized by multiple careers and ongoing education. A growing number of individuals, particularly from younger generations, are re-evaluating their professional trajectories, recognizing that adaptability is crucial in an ever-evolving job market. The desire to engage in various roles not only fulfills personal ambitions but also provides opportunities for financial stability.Historically, a full-time job with a reliable income was perceived as the ultimate goal for any potential employee. This conventional model allowed individuals to support themselves and their families adequately. However, the recent economic downturns, punctuated by global recessions, have significantly altered this landscape. With many industries experiencing volatile shifts, depending on a single source of income has become increasingly precarious. Today’s workers are more acutely aware of the risks involved in a singular career path, prompting them to seek out multiple avenues of income.Moreover, the pursuit of higher education is no longer confined to the early years of one’s life. The new working paradigm stresses the importance of lifelong learning, urging individuals to acquire multiple higher educational certificates. This not only enhances their employability but also equips them with a diverse skill set that can adapt to various industries. By blending education with practical experience through several jobs, individuals can create a more robust profile that appeals to a competitive job market.In conclusion, the traditional model of a single career is being replaced by a more dynamic framework where multiple careers and continuous education play pivotal roles. As economies fluctuate and job security becomes less predictable, the trend toward portfolio careers will likely shape the future of work, offering individuals both financial security and personal fulfillment.
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;The debate over the role of computers in today’s society is increasingly relevant as technology becomes integral to our daily lives. On one hand, some people argue that computers are more of a hindrance than a help. They contend that reliance on technology has led to diminished face-to-face interactions, which are vital for building genuine relationships. The proliferation of social media platforms, while enhancing communication across distances, has reportedly contributed to feelings of isolation and mental health issues among users. Critics also highlight concerns regarding privacy, the potential for cyberbullying, and the general erosion of personal privacy, as individuals' lives are often laid bare online.Conversely, many believe that computers are indispensable tools that enhance productivity and facilitate everyday tasks. In the world of work, computers streamline operations, allowing individuals to handle complex data analysis and communication tasks quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, they serve as conduits for education, providing access to vast resources and knowledge, enabling online learning and remote work. In a globalized world, the internet removes geographical barriers, connecting people and fostering collaborations that would have been impossible in earlier times.I strongly believe that computers have a profound influence on society, and it is undeniable that our lives have become significantly intertwined with these devices. The convenience and efficiency they offer are difficult to overlook. For example, personal tasks such as banking, shopping, and communication have all been revolutionized by technology. While some may argue for the detrimental effects of increased screen time and social disconnect, it is essential to recognize that the world operates on a digital framework. Thus, rather than viewing computers solely as hindrances, we should navigate their challenges while embracing the benefits they bring to our work, education, and communication.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;In today’s rapidly evolving workplace, the criteria for employee selection continue to be a topic of heated debate. On one hand, a growing number of employers are prioritizing social skills alongside traditional qualifications. On the other hand, many still argue that formal qualifications remain the most critical aspect of hiring. This essay will discuss both perspectives and present my own view.Proponents of emphasizing social skills argue that interpersonal abilities are vital for team cohesion and effective communication. As organizations grow increasingly collaborative, employees must not only possess technical expertise but also the capacity to engage, empathize, and adapt within diverse groups. A candidate with strong social skills can navigate office politics, inspire colleagues, and contribute positively to a workplace culture. For instance, professionals in customer-facing roles require excellent communication and conflict resolution skills to meet client needs swiftly and satisfactorily.Conversely, some employers remain steadfast in their belief that qualifications should take precedence over social skills. They argue that expert knowledge and technical proficiency are essential for task execution and that formal education and certifications provide evidence of a candidate’s capabilities and dedication. This view is particularly strong in industries such as healthcare and engineering, where specific qualifications are pivotal for critical tasks.In my opinion, while qualifications are important, the increasing complexity of the modern workplace necessitates a balance between technical expertise and social skills. As teamwork and collaboration become more prevalent, fostering interpersonal abilities is equally crucial for sustained organizational success. Therefore, I believe employers should adopt a holistic approach in their selection criteria that evaluates both qualifications and social skills. This way, they can ensure they hire well-rounded individuals who not only perform their duties effectively but also enhance the workplace environment.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;The debate surrounding the focus of charitable organizations is complex and multifaceted, with valid arguments on both sides. On one hand, advocates for international aid argue that charities should direct their resources to those facing the most severe hardships, regardless of geographic boundaries. This perspective is underscored by the dire circumstances many individuals endure in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where millions live below basic living standards. Issues such as famine, disease, and lack of access to clean water are rampant, and humanitarian aid can be critical in alleviating suffering in these areas. By distributing resources where they are most desperately needed, charities can have a significant impact on global health and socioeconomic stability.Conversely, there is a compelling argument for charities to focus their efforts within their own countries. Proponents of this view contend that domestic issues, such as homelessness, unemployment, and access to education and healthcare, require immediate attention and resources. Many citizens in developed nations face economic challenges and social disparities that demand support. By prioritizing local needs, charities can strengthen their communities, build trust among their constituents, and ensure that all individuals within their borders have access to essential services. In my opinion, while both perspectives hold merit, a balanced approach may be the most effective. Charitable organizations should indeed provide assistance to those in international crisis situations, as the severity of suffering in some parts of the world can far exceed that of domestic issues. However, they should also allocate resources to address pressing social problems within their own nations. This dual approach allows for the addressing of immediate global needs while fostering community well-being. Ultimately, the goal of charity should be to create a more equitable world, both at home and abroad.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;In today's educational landscape, the methods by which students at schools and universities acquire knowledge have undergone radical transformation compared to previous generations. Enhanced access to modern technology, including the internet and digital media, has revolutionized the way children study. This shift has led to the contention that lessons with teachers are less crucial than they once were, but I argue that both traditional teaching methods and alternative sources of information play essential roles in children's education.The vast availability of information at the fingertips of students represents a significant change from the past. With a simple click, learners can access a plethora of resources, ranging from academic articles to video lectures. This democratization of knowledge, augmented by relatively low-cost technology, provides students with diverse perspectives and a more comprehensive understanding of subjects beyond the confines of the classroom.However, while alternative sources can enhance learning, the role of teachers remains indispensable. Educators not only impart knowledge but also cultivate critical thinking, encourage discussions, and provide personalized guidance, which are often lacking in self-led learning experiences. The nuanced understanding of complex topics, the development of social skills, and the ability to engage in discourse are best facilitated through direct interaction with knowledgeable instructors.Moreover, the effectiveness of learning is not merely determined by the source of information but also by the ability to synthesize and apply that knowledge. Teachers foster an environment that encourages inquiry and helps students make connections that are often missed when studying independently. Therefore, both traditional methods and alternative sources contribute to the holistic acquisition of knowledge.In conclusion, while modern technology has transformed education, the importance of lessons with teachers remains paramount. The synergistic relationship between educators and various learning resources ultimately enhances the educational experience, ensuring that students are well-equipped for the challenges of the future.
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";International sporting events, particularly the football World Cup, are watched by millions across the globe, serving as a significant social stimulus that fosters community, unity, and sometimes even national pride. They offer a unique platform where countries compete not just for medals or trophies but also for admiration and recognition on an international stage. During these grand occasions, supporters gather in stadiums or watch together in homes, bars, and public places, creating shared experiences that can transcend cultural and political boundaries. One could argue that these events play an essential role in easing international tensions. By providing a common interest, they can shift focus from political differences to the celebration of athletic prowess and sportsmanship. The competition serves as a temporary detour from the complexities of real-world conflicts, allowing nations to engage in goodwill gestures, such as shared celebrations or collaborations during tournaments. For instance, diplomatic relations can soften as athletes and fans interact, fostering conversations and connections that might not occur in everyday scenarios.Nevertheless, while many view sports as a tool for fostering international unity, detractors argue that events like the World Cup are merely forms of entertainment that distract people from pressing social and political issues. Critics contend that these sporting occasions divert attention from significant global challenges, allowing governments to sidestep accountability by directing public focus toward the games. This perspective maintains that while national pride is invigorated, the underlying issues of international conflict might continue unaddressed.In conclusion, I maintain that while international sporting events like the football World Cup provide a valuable means of easing tensions and fostering camaraderie, they also risk serving as mere distractions from more significant issues. The balance between celebration and awareness is crucial, and ideally, these events should inspire both national pride and a commitment to addressing global challenges.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;In recent years, distance-learning programs have gained significant popularity, allowing students to acquire knowledge from the comfort of their homes using various mediums such as the Internet, television, and printed study material. While some individuals argue that these online platforms cannot match the benefits of traditional college or university education, I firmly disagree. Distance learning offers unique advantages that can enhance educational experiences and access.First and foremost, distance-learning programs significantly reduce commuting time and costs associated with attending physical classrooms. Traditional education often necessitates long hours spent traveling, which can be a hindrance for many students, especially those managing work or family commitments. With distance learning, students can allocate this time towards studying or engaging in other productive activities, thereby maximizing their learning potential.Additionally, the financial aspects of distance education make it a more appealing alternative. Students can save on tuition fees, which tend to be lower for online courses compared to their in-person counterparts. Furthermore, the elimination of commuting costs and expenses related to purchasing textbooks—many of which are available online for free or at significantly reduced rates—makes this mode of learning even more financially viable.Moreover, distance learning provides students with access to vast knowledge resources and diverse teaching approaches. Online platforms often offer a wealth of materials, from interactive videos to scholarly articles, allowing students to explore topics more comprehensively than they might in a traditional classroom. This wealth of resources can accommodate various learning styles, fostering a more personalized educational experience.In conclusion, while traditional education has its merits, distance-learning programs offer substantial benefits, including time and cost savings, along with access to a broader range of knowledge resources. As technology continues to evolve, the effectiveness and appeal of distance education will likely grow, making it an increasingly valid alternative to traditional college or university experiences.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;"The debate over the importance of protecting extinct species versus focusing on human-driven issues is multifaceted and evokes strong opinions on both sides. On one hand, animal protectionists argue vehemently that preserving biodiversity is essential for maintaining the ecological balance of our planet. Different species interact in complex ways within ecosystems, and the loss of one can have cascading effects that disrupt food webs, climate regulation, and overall biodiversity. Thus, by protecting endangered species, we contribute to the health of our environment, which, in turn, supports human life.Conversely, many argue that efforts to save extinct species should not overshadow pressing human issues such as poverty, healthcare, or education. They assert that resources spent on conservation could instead be used to address these humanitarian concerns, which often affect millions of people worldwide. Their viewpoint is grounded in a pragmatic approach to resource allocation, suggesting that in an era of limited resources, humanity's immediate challenges should take precedence.From a scientific perspective, extinction is a natural process that has characterized the Earth’s history. The theory of evolution posits that species have come and gone over millions of years, adapting to changing environments or succumbing to natural selection. Furthermore, the environment itself has undergone transformations that have led to mass extinctions, which suggests that while we may desire to protect certain species, extinction is not inherently unnatural.In my personal view, while it is crucial to address human issues, we should not neglect the importance of preserving biodiversity. Both human welfare and environmental health are interconnected; a healthy planet can contribute to improved quality of life for humans. Thus, a balanced approach that recognizes the intrinsic value of all species, along with the pressing needs of humanity, is essential in creating a sustainable future."
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;In today's context, education stands as a critical pillar that shapes an individual's future, influencing career opportunities, income potential, and overall quality of life. The debate over whether universities should maintain a gender parity in student admission remains a complex issue surrounded by varying opinions. In my personal view, there should not be any room for partiality based on gender in the allocation of seats for students across university courses.The notion of enforcing equal numbers of male and female students in every subject detracts from the core purpose of education, which is to cultivate talent and nurture ability irrespective of gender. Education should be a meritocratic process, where admission decisions are based on academic qualifications, skill sets, and potential contributions to the field rather than demographic characteristics. Imposing quotas based on gender can undermine this meritocracy, resulting in less qualified candidates occupying seats that could be filled by more capable individuals. Moreover, implementing gender quotas may diminish the achievements of both male and female students. Female students may feel their accomplishments are overshadowed by the notion that they were admitted to fulfill a quota rather than on the basis of merit. Similarly, male students might perceive their female counterparts as receiving preferential treatment, which could breed a sense of resentment. While promoting gender equality is an important goal, striving for absolute parity in every academic discipline may not be practical or beneficial. Instead, universities should focus on creating an inclusive environment that encourages diverse participation in traditionally male-dominated fields, such as STEM, through support programs, scholarships, and mentorship, rather than simply imposing equal admissions based on gender.In conclusion, while gender equality in education should be a priority, enforcing equal numbers of male and female students in every subject is not the appropriate approach. Instead, universities should prioritize merit and foster a culture of inclusivity that supports all students in achieving their academic and professional aspirations.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;The advent of advanced medical care has markedly transformed society, leading to increased life expectancy worldwide. This development, although beneficial, sparks a debate about whether its advantages outweigh any potential disadvantages. Firstly, the improvement in medical care is pivotal in enhancing life expectancy. Innovations such as telemedicine, robotic surgeries, and personalized medicine have revolutionized the healthcare landscape. As a result, individuals now receive better care, enabling them to lead healthier lives. Adequate healthcare not only alleviates suffering but also prevents minor health issues from escalating into more severe conditions. Consequently, people can enjoy longer lifespans, enriched by the quality of life brought forth through effective medical interventions.The main advantage of this extended life is the overall wellbeing of the elderly population. Healthy seniors contribute significantly to the community by sharing their wisdom and experience, thus promoting sustainable development. They can engage in volunteer work, mentor younger generations, and support community initiatives. Furthermore, with appropriate health management, older adults are less dependent on social services, easing the economic burden on society. However, the increasing number of elderly individuals does pose challenges. Healthcare systems must adapt to accommodate the growing demand for age-related, chronic care. Additionally, the pressure on pension systems and social services may lead to increased taxes or reduced benefits for younger generations. In conclusion, while the rise in life expectancy due to advanced medical care is accompanied by economic and social challenges, the benefits largely outweigh the drawbacks. A healthy elderly population can lead to vibrant communities and promote sustainable development. As society learns to navigate the complexities of an aging population, the focus should remain on enhancing healthcare systems to continue reaping the advantages of extended lifespans.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, sparking debates on its accessibility and the criteria for admission into institutions of higher learning. Two predominant views emerge: one argues that college education should be available to all students, while the other maintains that it should be reserved for those who demonstrate strong academic abilities. In my opinion, it is better to focus on a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.Restricting access to higher education for only talented individuals can help maintain the high quality of education offered by universities. When institutions emphasize the admission of capable students, they cultivate an environment of excellence that can lead to advanced research and innovative thinking. These students are often more engaged and motivated, contributing to collaborative learning experiences that benefit not only themselves but also their peers. This competitive atmosphere can inspire all students to strive for greater academic achievement.Furthermore, prioritizing good students creates a stronger foundation for generating skilled human resources for sophisticated purposes. In our increasingly complex world, the demand for highly educated professionals is steadily growing. By ensuring that universities produce graduates with a strong academic background, we can equip society with individuals capable of navigating and solving pressing global challenges. Skilled professionals in fields such as science, technology, and healthcare are crucial for advancements that drive societal progress and well-being.In conclusion, while the idea of providing equal access to higher education is commendable, I support the viewpoint that academic institutions should focus on admitting only good students. This policy not only upholds educational quality but also ensures the development of a competent workforce capable of meeting society's sophisticated demands, ultimately leading to a more prosperous future.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The debate surrounding whether universities should prioritize spending on improving facilities or hiring renowned faculty members is a contentious one. On one hand, proponents of investing in modern labs and general infrastructure argue that improved facilities significantly enhance the learning environment. On the other hand, some believe that having famous teachers is critical in providing high-quality education and inspiring students. Despite the merits of both perspectives, I firmly believe that universities should allocate resources toward improving facilities, as the advantages of this investment outweigh those of hiring famous educators.Investing in updated facilities not only enhances the overall educational experience but also fosters a conducive learning environment. Modern laboratories equipped with advanced technology enable students to engage in innovative research and practical applications, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world experiences. Furthermore, well-maintained classrooms and common areas can significantly affect students’ motivation and overall academic performance. A comfortable and stimulating environment encourages active participation and collaboration among students, which is essential for effective learning.Additionally, while renowned teachers may bring prestige to an institution, their impact is often limited to the courses they teach. In contrast, improved facilities benefit the entire student body, creating an inclusive environment where all students can thrive. A single renowned professor cannot reach every student, but a state-of-the-art laboratory or a well-furnished study space can accommodate countless learners and facilitate their growth.In conclusion, while hiring famous teachers may have its advantages, the long-term benefits of investing in university facilities are significantly greater. Enhanced facilities create a more enriched and collaborative academic environment, fostering student engagement and success across the board. Therefore, universities should prioritize facility improvements to ensure that all students receive the best possible educational experience.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;I strongly agree that high schools should allow students to study courses of their choosing. This approach not only nurtures individual interests but also promotes a more engaged and proactive learning environment.High school is a pivotal time when students begin to explore their passions and interests. By allowing them to select courses that resonate with them, schools help students to find fields of study that spark genuine enthusiasm. For example, a student passionate about the arts might thrive in a creative environment that allows for exploration in visual and performing arts. Such a focus not only enhances their skills but also boosts their confidence, preparing them for future opportunities.Moreover, before committing to a major in tertiary education, students should have the chance to experience a wide range of subjects. A well-rounded education facilitates informed decision-making. For instance, a student initially inclined toward science may discover an unexpected affinity for literature or sociology through elective courses. Such diversity in learning ensures that students can select majors that not only align with their interests but also leverage their strengths.Additionally, high schools should serve as stepping stones towards specialization in university. Allowing course selection fosters skills like critical thinking and independence, thereby molding students into active learners who are better equipped for higher education’s demands. When students engage deeply with subjects they are passionate about, they are more likely to excel in their studies and remain motivated throughout their university careers.In conclusion, enabling students to choose their own courses in high school cultivates individuality, encourages broad exploration of knowledge, and prepares them for specialized study in university. Such autonomy in education is crucial for developing well-rounded and fulfilled individuals ready to contribute meaningfully to society.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;The debate over the importance of games for adults compared to children is a nuanced one, with opinions varying widely. Some people believe that adults need games just as children do, arguing that play is essential for development at any age. While there are merits to this viewpoint, I contend that games are not as crucial for adults, primarily due to the pressures of work and family commitments that lead many to abandon their lifelong hobbies.Firstly, adults often face immense pressure in their professional lives, where responsibilities and deadlines take precedence over leisure activities. The ambition to climb the corporate ladder or maintain job stability can leave little room for the relaxation that games provide. For instance, a working parent may find themselves prioritizing work deadlines over a weekend soccer match or board game night, as they seek to fulfill critical obligations that do not leave space for play.Moreover, family commitments significantly alter the landscape of leisure for adults. Many find themselves consumed by the responsibilities of raising children, attending to household chores, and managing finances. In these circumstances, the opportunity to engage in games diminishes. Instead of playing for fun, adults often feel compelled to focus on familial duties, pushing aside their interests and hobbies, including games they once enjoyed.Additionally, as adults mature, their need for play changes. While games in childhood foster social skills and cognitive development, adults often find value in different forms of relaxation, such as reading, exercising, or engaging in social gatherings that do not involve traditional gaming. This shift in focus indicates that, while games can still be a source of enjoyment for adults, they do not carry the same level of necessity as they do for children.In conclusion, while the benefits of play are recognized across all ages, the intense demands of adult life often necessitate a reevaluation of how and when individuals engage in games. The reality of adult responsibilities largely diminishes the importance of games for adults in comparison to their vital role in childhood development.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";Modern technology is undeniably playing a significant role in shaping a single world culture, as evidenced by the growing similarities among various cultures. From communication to education, technology has woven an intricate tapestry that connects individuals globally, often leading to the homogenization of cultural practices and values. One of the most apparent impacts of modern technology is the way students across the globe share similar educational experiences. For instance, students in Iran and Canada, despite their geographical separation and diverse cultural backgrounds, frequently use the same software, like Microsoft Office, to complete their homework and deliver presentations. This reliance on common technological tools fosters a shared method of learning and expression, contributing to the emergence of a uniform educational culture.Furthermore, the rise of the internet and social media platforms has amplified this cultural convergence. Today, diverse groups access similar content, whether through global streaming services, online gaming, or social networks. Youth in various countries are now exposed to similar influences such as music, fashion, and entertainment, often leading to shared trends and tastes that transcend traditional cultural boundaries. For instance, the popularity of K-pop, originating from South Korea, is evident in countries far removed from its origin, illustrating how modern technology facilitates cultural exchange and adoption.Moreover, the accessibility of information fosters dialogue and collaboration among diverse populations, creating a shared space for cultural synthesis. As individuals share ideas, values, and beliefs through technology, they become influenced by one another, gradually leading to the formation of a more unified global culture.In conclusion, modern technology promotes the creation of a single world culture by fostering connections and similarities among different societies. As students and individuals engage with similar technological tools, content, and platforms, cultural lines blur, leading to an increasingly interconnected global community.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;In today’s fast-paced and highly interconnected world, the role of family in achieving success has become increasingly significant. While some may argue that success is often a solitary journey, I firmly believe that, nowadays, receiving assistance from family is an essential factor in attaining success. Several reasons support this notion, highlighting the enhanced influence families have on individuals’ achievements.Firstly, modern families often provide emotional and psychological support, which is crucial in navigating the challenges of today’s competitive environment. With the pressures of academic performance, career choices, and social media expectations, individuals frequently rely on their families for guidance and encouragement. This unwavering support system can instill a sense of confidence and resilience, empowering individuals to pursue their goals more vigorously than they might without such backing. This emotional scaffolding is instrumental in equipping people to face failures and obstacles, ultimately aiding them in their quest for success.Secondly, families now tend to have more resources and connections than in the past, due in part to advancements in technology and globalization. These resources can range from financial backing to access to networks that can facilitate job opportunities and mentorship. For instance, families often leverage their professional connections to help the younger generation secure internships or job placements, openings that may be challenging to attain through conventional means. This not only accelerates the path to success but also enhances the prospects of achieving it in more favorable conditions.In conclusion, I assert that the assistance from family plays a more pivotal role in paving the way for success in contemporary society compared to earlier times. Emotional support and resource accessibility have become integral components that empower individuals to navigate their paths effectively in an era brimming with possibilities yet fraught with challenges.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";In the ongoing debate about whether reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies, I firmly believe that reading offers a deeper and more immersive experience. This preference stems from two main reasons: the attention to detail in fiction and the convenience that reading provides.Firstly, fiction books often immerse readers in elaborate details that movies simply cannot match. As readers delve into a novel or short story, they engage their imaginations, picturing settings, characters, and emotions as described by the author. This level of detail allows readers to cultivate their own interpretations and mental imagery, leading to a more personalized experience. For instance, when reading a fantasy novel, the intricate world-building and nuanced character development can evoke a sense of wonder that is often diluted in film adaptations. Movies tend to condense plotlines or simplify characters to fit within a limited timeframe, sometimes sacrificing the depth that readers find in the written word.Secondly, reading a novel is often more convenient for those with busy lifestyles. Many novels are comprised of around 100 pages, allowing readers to engage with a story at their own pace. Unlike movies, which typically require a dedicated block of time, readers can savor chapters at intervals that fit into their schedules. For example, I frequently find myself caught up in study sessions, where I can enjoy a few pages of a novel in just 15 minutes, rather than committing to an entire movie that demands over an hour of uninterrupted attention. This flexibility allows readers to enjoy literature throughout their day without the pressure of finishing a lengthy viewing.In conclusion, for those who appreciate the subtleties of storytelling and seek a flexible form of entertainment, reading fiction often proves to be a more enjoyable experience than watching movies. The detailed narratives and adaptable reading times create a fulfilling and personal escapade into the world of literature.
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";"The decline of languages is a complex issue that brings forth a range of opinions. While some assert that a world with fewer languages promotes harmony and understanding, others emphasize the importance of linguistic diversity and the cultural richness that comes with it.Proponents of a single global language argue that it simplifies communication, thereby fostering better interpersonal relations among individuals from different backgrounds. A common language can eliminate the barriers travelers face in daily activities, such as ordering food in a restaurant or navigating public transportation. By having a universal language, misunderstandings could be significantly reduced, leading to smoother interactions. Furthermore, the ease of communication may promote collaboration and unity in a world that is increasingly interconnected through technology and global trade.However, the argument for linguistic homogenization overlooks the profound cultural significance that languages hold. Each language embodies the history, traditions, and identity of its speakers. The loss of a language can lead to the erasure of unique worldviews and perspectives. When languages die out, we risk losing invaluable knowledge about human experiences, local ecology, and traditional practices that cannot be captured in a single global dialect. Moreover, linguistic diversity promotes cognitive flexibility; bilingual or multilingual individuals often exhibit greater problem-solving skills due to their ability to think in multiple linguistic frameworks.In my opinion, while having a common language can facilitate certain interactions, the preservation of linguistic diversity is crucial. Promoting multilingualism is a more balanced approach, allowing people to communicate effectively while still honoring their cultural identities. Rather than mourning the loss of languages, society should strive to celebrate and protect the numerous languages that reflect humanity's rich tapestry, cultivating both understanding and respect among diverse communities. Ultimately, a harmonious world should not come at the cost of cultural loss."
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;Many elderly individuals often reflect on their past, asserting that life was simpler and better than it is today. While it is understandable that nostalgia can color our perceptions, I believe this view does not fully appreciate the remarkable advancements that define our current era.In today's world, technology is developing at an unprecedented pace, transforming our daily lives into a more convenient experience. For instance, tasks that once required significant time and effort, such as shopping or communication, have been revolutionized by the internet and mobile technology. With just a few clicks, we can order groceries and connect with loved ones across the globe in real-time. This newfound accessibility and efficiency allows individuals to spend their time more wisely on pursuits that matter most to them, be it building relationships, learning, or enjoying leisure activities.Furthermore, the phenomenal progress in medical science over the last decade cannot be overlooked. Breakthroughs in areas such as telemedicine, personalized medicine, and advanced treatments for life-threatening diseases have significantly enhanced the quality of life for many. For example, today’s elderly population has access to treatments for ailments that were previously untreatable, allowing them to live longer, healthier lives. Consider the development of minimally invasive surgeries and robotic-assisted procedures. These advancements not only reduce recovery times but also improve outcomes, transforming elderly care into a more compassionate and effective process.While it is natural for older generations to romanticize the past, the present offers a wealth of benefits that can contribute to a more fulfilled and healthier existence. As we harness the potential of ongoing technological and medical enhancements, we are paving the way for a brighter future. Therefore, rather than seeing the past as inherently better, it is essential to embrace the progress we have made and continue to strive for a life that is not only simpler but also richer and more rewarding.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;The necessity of teaching financial management to secondary and higher school students has been a topic of heated debate. Some argue that introducing financial concepts at a young age could lead to detrimental effects, potentially burdening students with adult responsibilities too soon. Despite this concern, I firmly believe that educating students about money management is an essential life skill that can empower them for the future.Financial literacy is critical in today’s complex economic landscape. Young adults often step into a world filled with financial decisions—whether it’s budgeting for college expenses, understanding credit, or making informed choices about loans. Without a foundational knowledge of money management, students may find themselves ill-prepared to navigate these challenges, which can lead to harmful financial practices, such as accruing excessive debt or falling victim to fraud.Moreover, teaching financial management can cultivate responsibility and independence among students. It encourages them to develop a budget, saving techniques, and investment understanding. These skills not only help them become financially astute as adults but also instill a sense of accountability regarding their economic choices. By addressing these concepts in school, educators can provide a structured learning environment where students can engage with real-life scenarios in a supportive setting.While the concern that exposing students to financial matters may overwhelm them is valid, educators can mitigate this risk by incorporating age-appropriate, practical lessons into the curriculum. The focus should not be on making students experts overnight, but rather on providing them with tools to make informed decisions as they grow.In conclusion, I advocate for the inclusion of financial management education in secondary and higher school curricula. By doing so, we equip our youth with essential skills that will serve them well into adulthood, fostering a generation of financially literate individuals who can confidently navigate the complexities of the modern economic world.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;I strongly agree that smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. This stance is rooted in the need to create a comfortable and safe dining environment for all patrons. Restaurants are places where individuals come to enjoy their meals, socialize with friends and family, and create memorable experiences. Allowing smoking in these establishments compromises this atmosphere, forcing non-smokers to breathe in secondhand smoke, which can be both uncomfortable and harmful to their health.The health risks associated with secondhand smoke are well-documented. Non-smokers exposed to smoking in restaurants may experience short-term discomfort such as coughing or a sore throat, as well as long-term risks, including respiratory diseases and even cancer. It is fundamentally unfair for passive smokers—those who do not smoke but are nonetheless subjected to the same harmful toxins—to face these health threats simply because others choose to smoke in their vicinity.Furthermore, allowing smoking in restaurants sends a troubling message to vulnerable populations, including children, grandparents, and pregnant women. Young children, who are impressionable and in their formative years, may view smoking as socially acceptable behavior simply because they witness it in public spaces. This normalizes a habit that poses significant health risks. Grandparents, who may already have existing health conditions, are particularly susceptible to the dangers of secondhand smoke. Pregnant women face the risk of serious complications, including low birth weight and developmental issues for their unborn children. In conclusion, prohibiting smoking in restaurants is a necessary measure to protect public health, ensure a comfortable dining experience, and set a positive example for future generations. Upholding state laws that enforce this ban is essential for promoting a healthier, smoke-free environment for everyone.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;The prevalence of violence in films has become increasingly pronounced over the last two decades. As filmmakers seek to attract audiences, many have resorted to graphic depictions of violence as a means of advertisement. This trend raises significant concerns, particularly regarding its impact on young viewers. From my perspective, the growing violence in movies has detrimental effects on youngsters, primarily influencing their behavior, emotions, and academic performance.Firstly, an increase in violence in films often desensitizes young audiences to aggressive behavior. When children and teenagers are exposed to violent scenes repeatedly, they may come to view such behavior as acceptable or even normative. Research indicates that prolonged exposure to violent media can lead to an increase in aggressive thoughts and actions among youngsters, potentially resulting in real-life conflicts and behavioral issues. The imitation of violent acts portrayed on screen could manifest in bullying, fighting, or other forms of aggression during their formative years.Secondly, the emotional consequences of consuming violent media cannot be overlooked. Young viewers may struggle with anxiety, fear, or even apathy as they process violent imagery. Over time, this could lead to emotional numbness or difficulty in forming empathetic responses towards others, eroding their emotional intelligence. Moreover, cultivation of these reactions can hinder healthy social interactions and relationships, creating a further divide from their peers.Finally, the time young individuals dedicate to watching violent films could detract from their academic pursuits. Engaging with violent media may attract their attention to the detriment of more productive activities, such as studying, reading, or participating in physical exercise. This misallocation of time could adversely affect their academic performance and overall intellectual development.In conclusion, the increasing violence depicted in films presents multifaceted challenges for young audiences. It not only influences their behavior negatively but also impacts their emotional health and academic success. To foster a healthy environment for youngsters, it is crucial for parents, educators, and policymakers to actively monitor and discuss the media they consume.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";"In the modern age, the adage ""information is power"" has never been more applicable. A well-informed individual possesses the ability to make educated decisions, engage in meaningful discussions, and understand the complexities of the world. To attain such an informed perspective, it is essential to draw from a multitude of news sources rather than rely on a singular outlet. In this essay, I will discuss my agreement with the notion that diverse sources are necessary for a comprehensive understanding of current affairs.One significant advantage of consulting various news sources is the enhancement of reliability. Different media organizations often have varying editorial slants and reporting styles. By comparing information from reputable sources—whether they be print, television, or online platforms—individuals can discern facts from biases. This approach mitigates the risk of being misled by sensationalized or skewed narratives. Furthermore, engaging with multiple perspectives on a topic allows for a more nuanced understanding and promotes critical thinking.Moreover, the digital age has made information more accessible than ever. Through the internet, individuals can easily seek out independent journalists, alternative news platforms, and international outlets. This breadth of information enables a deeper exploration of events or problems, grounding opinions in factual evidence rather than assumptions or estimations. For instance, understanding global issues such as climate change or political conflicts requires insight from multiple angles, ensuring a more holistic viewpoint.In conclusion, to be truly well-informed, one must actively seek information from a variety of news sources. The reliability of information is bolstered by diverse perspectives, thereby enabling individuals to engage with current events meaningfully and accurately. In a world brimming with misinformation, this pursuit becomes not only important but essential for informed citizenship."
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;The debate surrounding the preservation of old buildings in urban settings highlights a significant conflict between the pressing need for housing and the desire to protect cultural heritage. On one hand, proponents of demolishing old structures argue that land in cities is increasingly valuable. As urban populations swell, the demand for housing rises, leading many to advocate for the conversion of historical sites into modern accommodations. This perspective often emphasizes the practicality of using available land to meet the immediate needs of citizens, suggesting that prioritizing residential development over preservation is a necessary step toward alleviating housing shortages.Conversely, advocates for the preservation of old buildings assert that these structures play a crucial role in maintaining a society's historical narrative and cultural identity. Old buildings provide a tangible connection to the past, enriching the fabric of city life and offering residents a sense of belonging and continuity. Historic sites often serve as reminders of a city's heritage, attracting tourists and generating economic benefits through cultural tourism. Therefore, destroying these buildings can lead to a loss of unique character and identity within communities. In my opinion, it is essential to conserve all old buildings that contribute to our sense of culture and community. Not only do these buildings encapsulate the stories of those who lived before us, but they also foster a sense of pride among current residents. While the need for housing is pressing, innovative solutions such as adaptive reuse can allow cities to balance development needs with the preservation of cultural heritage. Ultimately, by valuing and protecting our historical sites, we nurture a richer, more diverse urban landscape that honors our past while accommodating future growth.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;In today’s tech-driven world, mobile phones have become an essential part of young people's lives, often regarded as their most important possession. While they offer numerous benefits, I believe the prevailing popularity of mobile phones among the youth reflects a troubling development.One significant drawback is the distraction factor. Many young students find themselves struggling academically because they are constantly glued to their screens. During class, it's common to see students distracted by notifications, social media, or gaming apps instead of focusing on lectures. For instance, in my classroom, I’ve observed peers scrolling through their phones instead of participating in discussions. This lack of engagement not only hampers their learning but also limits their social interactions in face-to-face settings.Moreover, the prevalence of mobile phones contributes to an increasing sense of materialism among young people. With easy access to platforms that emphasize wealth and consumerism, many adolescents begin to associate self-worth with the latest gadgets or social media status. I’ve noticed friends who feel inadequate or anxious if they don’t own the newest smartphone model or receive a certain number of likes on their posts. This obsession with material possessions can lead to unhealthy desires for validation and status, overshadowing the importance of genuine relationships and experiences.While mobile phones undoubtedly serve as valuable communication tools and sources of information, their overwhelming presence in the daily lives of the youth tends to cultivate distractions and materialistic values. Instead of enhancing their lives, these devices can hinder personal growth and academic performance. In conclusion, despite their utility, the immense popularity of mobile phones among young people poses significant challenges that warrant concern.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";"The debate over whether to implement fixed punishments for specific crimes or to consider individual circumstances during sentencing presents compelling arguments on both sides. Proponents of fixed punishments assert that such an approach offers clarity, efficiency, and fairness. However, it also carries significant drawbacks, especially concerning criminal behavior.One of the main arguments for fixed punishments is that they streamline the judicial process, allowing judges to deliver sentences more swiftly and thereby reducing the court's backlog. This efficiency could lead to economic savings for the government, as fewer resources would be devoted to lengthy trials and deliberations. Moreover, having predetermined penalties can create a sense of deterrence; potential offenders might rethink their actions if they know the exact consequences they will face for certain crimes.However, an indiscriminate application of fixed punishments risks inadvertently increasing crime rates. Professional criminals, in particular, may exploit the predictability of these predetermined sentencing structures. If they understand the consequences of their actions clearly, they may resort to tailored crime strategies that allow them to evade harsher penalties, thus diminishing the deterrent effect of the law. The rigidity of fixed punishments can fail to account for varying motivations behind criminal acts – for example, crimes of desperation or necessity can differ starkly from premeditated offenses.Moreover, the legal system's ability to exercise compassion and consider mitigating factors may be undermined by a policy of fixed punishments. Sentencing should take into account the motivations and circumstances that led to the crime, allowing for a more nuanced response to wrongdoings that acknowledges not only the act but also the context, which can be essential in promoting rehabilitation over mere retribution.In conclusion, while fixed punishments present advantages in terms of efficiency and clarity, they risk oversimplifying the complexities of human behavior and the underlying motivations for crime. A balanced approach that incorporates both consistency in sentencing and consideration of individual circumstances may ultimately lead to a more just and effective legal system."
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap air travel has revolutionized the way people explore the world, providing unprecedented opportunities for ordinary individuals to travel to distant locations. This accessibility has particularly benefited lower-income groups, allowing them to venture beyond their local confines and experience diverse cultures, landscapes, and adventures that were previously financially out of reach. With low-cost airlines proliferating, flying has become a commonplace mode of transport, contributing to the democratization of travel and enriching people's lives.However, this increase in air travel comes with a significant downside: the adverse environmental impact. The surge in flight availability inevitably leads to busier airports and more frequent flights, which contributes to the deterioration of air quality for those living and working near these facilities. Furthermore, the burning of aviation fuel during flights releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming and climate change. As the Earth’s temperature continues to rise, the repercussions for ecosystems and human populations become ever more severe.In my opinion, while cheap air travel has undeniably expanded the horizons for many, the environmental costs cannot be overlooked. Striking a balance between accessibility and environmental responsibility is essential. One potential solution could be to implement a pricing structure that encourages responsible travel. For instance, raising the costs of flights during peak travel times could help mitigate the surge of travelers while still allowing people to enjoy affordable fares during off-peak seasons. Ultimately, fostering a more sustainable approach to air travel can ensure that future generations retain the freedom to explore the globe without compromising the health of our planet.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;Living in a small town or a big city presents distinct experiences, each with its own advantages and challenges. While small town life has its charm, I prefer to live in a big city for several compelling reasons.One of the most significant factors influencing my preference for city life is the proximity to job opportunities. In today's competitive job market, securing employment can greatly depend on location. Big cities are often hubs for diverse industries, which means a plethora of job options ranging from technology and finance to arts and education. Access to these opportunities significantly reduces commuting time, allowing me to maintain a better work-life balance. For instance, if I were to work in a vibrant urban setting, the convenience of a shorter commute would afford me more time for leisure and personal growth.Moreover, big cities are synonymous with modern living and advanced facilities. In an urban environment, I can take advantage of various conveniences such as public transportation, healthcare, and education systems that are often superior to those found in smaller towns. For example, cities typically host state-of-the-art hospitals and universities, offering higher quality services and more diverse programs. This access enhances the overall quality of life and personal development.Furthermore, living in a big city provides a rich tapestry of cultural experiences and stimulation. City life is dynamic, filled with numerous events, exhibitions, and entertainment options. This constant flow of information and interaction with a diverse population broadens my horizons, enabling me to learn from various cultures and perspectives. The availability of art galleries, theaters, and music festivals fosters creativity and inspires new ideas.In conclusion, while small towns may offer tranquility and a close-knit community, my preference leans toward big city living due to the abundance of job opportunities, advanced facilities, and stimulating experiences. City life, with its myriad possibilities, represents not just a place to live, but a chance to thrive.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;"While salary increases and promotions are widely recognized and traditional methods for rewarding employees for their hard work, there exist various alternative strategies that can be just as effective in encouraging further excellence in the workplace. Beyond the common monetary rewards, organizations can leverage professional training opportunities to boost employee motivation and productivity.Providing professional training is a powerful tool to reward employees. When organizations invest in training programs, they signal that they value their workforce and are committed to their employees' growth. For instance, offering opportunities for skill development through workshops, online courses, and certifications allows employees to enhance their capabilities and expand their professional horizons. A company that sponsors employees to attend a relevant industry conference not only rewards their hard work but also positions them to return with fresh insights and inspiration that can greatly benefit the organization.Another effective non-monetary reward is public recognition. Celebrating employees’ accomplishments in team meetings or through company-wide newsletters can foster a culture of appreciation. For example, recognizing ""Employee of the Month"" or highlighting specific projects that have exceeded expectations promotes a sense of pride and belonging, motivating others to strive for similar acknowledgment. This recognition can be further enhanced by peer-to-peer recognition programs, which can create camaraderie and strengthen workplace bonds.Furthermore, flexible working arrangements can serve as a significant reward for good work. Allowing high-performing employees to choose their own work hours or work remotely can contribute to a better work-life balance. For instance, an employee who consistently meets their targets could be rewarded with the option to work from home one day a week, thereby promoting loyalty and job satisfaction.In conclusion, while salary increases and promotions are important, alternative rewards such as professional training, public recognition, and flexible work arrangements can effectively encourage employees to maintain and elevate their performance. These strategies not only promote a positive organizational culture but also help in fostering the continuous development and engagement of employees in their roles."
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;"The debate surrounding whether university students should be required to attend classes or have the option to attend is an intriguing one. I firmly believe that attendance should be optional for students. This perspective is rooted in the understanding that university education is not a one-size-fits-all experience; students often learn effectively through various means outside the traditional classroom setting.Firstly, the advent of technology has revolutionized how information is disseminated and consumed. Students can access a wealth of knowledge online, including recorded lectures, educational videos, and interactive learning platforms. These resources allow for a more personalized and flexible learning environment. For many students, self-directed learning proves to be more effective, as they can engage with the material at their own pace and revisit complex concepts when needed.Moreover, libraries and study groups provide conducive environments for focused learning. By utilizing these spaces, students can not only delve deeper into subjects they find challenging but also collaborate with peers for a richer educational experience. This kind of interaction fosters a sense of community and mutual support that is sometimes lacking in traditional lecture formats. Furthermore, the option to forego class attendance can also encourage students to take ownership of their education. Building the ability to manage one’s own learning path is a vital skill that extends beyond university. It empowers students to explore their interests more deeply, pursue internships, work part-time, or engage in extracurricular activities that contribute to their overall development.In conclusion, while attending classes can be beneficial for some, the flexibility of choosing when and how to learn is essential for fostering individual growth and fostering a love for knowledge. Making class attendance optional allows students to cultivate their learning experiences in a manner that suits their unique needs and preferences."
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;As I approach the completion of my studies at university, the decision regarding where to live becomes increasingly significant. While small towns offer charm and a slower pace of life, I find myself more inclined toward the vibrant opportunities that a big city presents.One compelling reason for my preference is the professional prospects available in a metropolitan area. As an engineering student, I recognize that cities are often the hubs of innovation and industry. The likelihood of securing a job in my field is considerably higher in an urban environment, where numerous companies are striving to stay ahead in technology and infrastructure. Living in a big city would not only facilitate my job search but also provide a dynamic work environment that fosters growth.Moreover, the plethora of recreational activities in cities is undeniably appealing. In a big city, I can immerse myself in a diverse cultural scene, visiting art galleries, attending concerts, or exploring vibrant neighborhoods. The abundance of bars, cafes, and restaurants offers countless opportunities to socialize with friends and meet new people. This social aspect is crucial for me as I hope to build a strong network both personally and professionally.Lastly, the quality of medical facilities in urban areas is another vital consideration. Access to advanced healthcare services and specialists is significantly better in cities, providing peace of mind regarding health emergencies and ongoing medical care. This aspect is particularly important as I establish my independence after university.In conclusion, while small towns have their allure, the advantages of living in a big city – from career opportunities to social activities and superior healthcare – align more closely with my aspirations and lifestyle. Thus, I envision my future flourishing in the bustling environment of a big city.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;The advent of computer technology has undoubtedly transformed our lives, marking a significant milestone in the development of advanced technology. While some argue that computers have complicated life and increased stress levels, I firmly believe that they have made life easier and more convenient, primarily by enabling easier access to information and enhancing the quality of communication.Firstly, the accessibility to information in the digital age is unprecedented. With a few clicks, we can access an infinite pool of knowledge on virtually any topic. For instance, students can conduct research, consult academic resources, and connect with experts from around the world, all from the comfort of their homes. This has not only streamlined the learning process but has also democratized education, allowing individuals from various backgrounds to expand their understanding and skills without the geographic and financial constraints of traditional education.Moreover, computers have revolutionized communication. Social media platforms, emails, and video conferencing tools have significantly bridged gaps between people, allowing for instant communication regardless of distance. Families separated by oceans can now readily share their lives through video calls, and businesses can operate on a global scale by connecting with clients and partners across continents. This connectivity fosters collaboration, innovation, and the sharing of ideas, leading to enhanced social interactions and economic growth.Critics may argue that the digital world brings complexities and stresses, such as information overload or multitasking demands. However, these challenges can often be managed with the development of digital literacy and effective time-management skills. Ultimately, when we weigh the advantages and conveniences against the potential drawbacks, it becomes clear that computers have enriched our lives, making them more manageable rather than overly complex. Thus, in my opinion, the benefits of computers significantly outweigh the negatives, contributing to a more connected, informed, and convenient way of living.
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;The rise of computers and modems has transformed the way we approach work, especially with the advent of remote working. Many advocate for this shift, asserting that working from home provides unparalleled convenience and flexibility. However, I disagree with this notion, as I believe that working remotely can also lead to significant drawbacks that are often overlooked.One of the key arguments in favor of working from home is the convenience it brings. Employees can save time on commuting, enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere, and create a personalized workspace. While these benefits are appealing, they can also lead to a false sense of productivity. In a home environment, distractions abound—whether they be household chores or family obligations—that can hinder performance. The absence of structured hours can blur the lines between work and personal life, potentially leading to burnout rather than the anticipated work-life balance.Furthermore, working remotely often limits essential workplace interactions. Collaboration, brainstorming sessions, and team building are easier to foster in a traditional office where spontaneous communication is possible. The lack of face-to-face interaction can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection among coworkers. This not only affects team dynamics but can also diminish the overall workplace culture—a crucial component for employee satisfaction and retention.Additionally, without the pressure and accountability that come with an office environment, some individuals may struggle to maintain motivation and discipline in their work. This self-management challenge can result in a decline in work quality and productivity, contrary to the expectations that remote work can deliver.In conclusion, while the prospect of working from home offers undeniable advantages, it is crucial to recognize the potential pitfalls associated with this arrangement. In my opinion, fostering a balanced approach that incorporates both remote work and in-office collaboration may be the most effective strategy for maximizing productivity and employee well-being.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;The role of a university professor has long been a topic of debate, particularly regarding the balance between research and teaching. While both aspects are vital to the academic environment, I believe that professors should prioritize course preparation over research. The implications of their focus have a profound impact on students’ learning experiences and the overall reputation of the university.Primarily, a professor’s primary responsibility is to educate students. If professors dedicate too much time to their research and neglect the preparation of lectures and course materials, the quality of education suffers. Well-prepared courses enhance student engagement and comprehension, which are crucial for cultivating a productive learning atmosphere. When professors invest time in developing their curricula and teaching methodologies, they directly contribute to the intellectual growth of their students. Conversely, a lack of focus on curriculum design can lead to disenchanted students, resulting in diminished institutional reputation.Moreover, while research is essential to the advancement of knowledge, it can be integrated effectively into the educational framework. Professors can engage students through hands-on projects and research-oriented assignments. This method allows students to learn in a practical, interactive manner while simultaneously benefiting from the professors’ research expertise. When professors involve students in their research initiatives, it fosters a collaborative academic environment where students gain invaluable experience and insight, bridging the gap between theoretical learning and practical application.In conclusion, while research is a significant component of a professor’s career, teaching should remain at the forefront of their responsibilities. Prioritizing course preparation ensures a higher quality of education, which ultimately strengthens a university’s reputation. An effective balance can be achieved where research complements education, but it is crucial that the primary focus remains on nurturing and developing students.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;Technological progress in the past century has undeniably transformed the way we live, work, and interact, contributing significantly to economic growth and improvements in living standards. Innovations in various fields, including information technology, medicine, and transportation, have driven productivity and efficiency, resulting in higher GDPs and the creation of new job opportunities. Moreover, advancements in healthcare technologies have vastly improved treatment options, leading to increased life expectancy and a better quality of life for millions worldwide. For instance, the development of telemedicine and precision medicine has revolutionized patient care, making it more accessible and effective.However, while the benefits of technological advances are substantial, it is essential to acknowledge their negative effects on the environment and social structures. The rapid industrialization spurred by technological innovation has contributed to ecological degradation, including deforestation, pollution, and climate change. Manufacturing processes and increased consumption of resources have resulted in significant environmental footprints, raising concerns about sustainability. As a result, the consequences of these practices often lead to health problems and environmental disasters that disproportionately affect marginalized communities.Furthermore, technology can exacerbate social inequalities. The digital divide highlights how access to technology is not uniform across different strata of society, often leaving underprivileged groups further behind. Automation and artificial intelligence threaten job security in various sectors, as machines replace human labor, leading to unemployment and economic displacement.In conclusion, while technological progress has brought about remarkable advancements in economic growth, living standards, and healthcare, it is crucial to consider its detrimental impact on the environment and societal dynamics. A balanced approach, focusing on sustainable practices and equitable access to technology, is essential to mitigate the negative consequences while harnessing its benefits for future generations.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The maxim ""prevention is better than cure"" holds significant weight, especially in the context of modern healthcare systems and the welfare state model, where governments are expected to ensure the well-being of their citizens. In today’s world, where rising healthcare costs and the prevalence of non-communicable diseases place immense pressure on health budgets, shifting a substantial portion of financial resources from treatment to health education and preventative measures is not only wise but essential.A proactive approach to health management can yield tremendous benefits. By investing in public health education, governments can equip individuals with the knowledge and tools necessary to adopt healthier lifestyles, thereby reducing the incidence of lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Educational campaigns that promote healthy eating, regular physical activity, and mental well-being can foster a culture of health that mitigates the need for extensive medical interventions later. Preventative measures, including vaccinations and screenings, also play a crucial role in early detection and exposure reduction, which ultimately save both lives and healthcare costs.Moreover, the sustainability of healthcare systems hinges on their ability to evolve from reactive treatment paradigms to proactive prevention-focused strategies. Countries that prioritize education and preventive healthcare often see improved public health outcomes, resulting in an overall healthier population that requires fewer resources dedicated to treatment. This not only enhances the quality of life for citizens but also alleviates financial burdens on government health budgets, allowing for funds to be redirected towards enhancing and expanding health education programs.In conclusion, as we navigate the complexities of modern healthcare demands, it is imperative that a greater proportion of health budgets be allocated to education and preventive measures rather than treatment. By fostering a culture of prevention, governments can ensure a healthier future for their citizens, ultimately creating a more sustainable health system in line with the ideals of the welfare state."
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;When deciding where to live during university, students often face the choice between university dormitories and community apartments. Both options present unique advantages and disadvantages, catering to varying preferences and lifestyles.Living in university dormitories is advantageous for several reasons. Firstly, dormitories foster a close-knit community, allowing students to easily connect with peers and make lasting friendships. The communal environment often enhances the social aspect of university life, providing numerous opportunities for group study sessions and extracurricular activities. Additionally, dormitories usually offer convenient access to campus facilities such as libraries, dining halls, and recreational areas, thereby minimizing travel time and promoting a more engaged academic life.Conversely, living in an apartment located in the community offers a different set of benefits. One significant advantage is the level of freedom and independence that comes with renting an apartment. Students have greater control over their living environment, including the ability to choose roommates, decorate their space, and establish personal routines. Furthermore, off-campus apartments often provide quieter surroundings, conducive to studying, which is particularly advantageous for students who need focused environments for their academic work. Additionally, depending on the area, living in an apartment might offer more economical options, as shared-leases can reduce overall housing costs.After considering factors such as freedom, study conditions, and economic implications, I would prefer to live in an apartment. The independence of choosing my living arrangement and the ability to create a personalized study space are compelling aspects that align with my academic goals. Moreover, having a quieter environment away from the bustling dormitory life would likely enhance my concentration and productivity, supporting my overall success during university. Ultimately, while dormitories foster community, the benefits of off-campus living better suit my personal and academic preferences.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"In the realm of cinema, two predominant categories emerge: serious films that provoke thought and comedic movies aimed at entertainment. While both types hold intrinsic value, I personally prefer serious movies for their ability to engage viewers on a deeper intellectual and emotional level. Nonetheless, I acknowledge the charm of comedies, such as the film ""Click,"" which stands out for its unique blend of humor with an underlying serious message about the importance of balance in life.""Click,"" starring Adam Sandler, is a compelling example of a comedy that exemplifies the importance of prioritizing family over relentless work commitments. Through its humorous narrative, the film plunges into the existential dilemma many individuals face in today’s fast-paced society. It cleverly showcases the consequences of neglecting personal relationships in favor of career ambitions. The comedic approach paradoxically highlights a profound truth: life is not solely about climbing the corporate ladder, but about nurturing connections and enjoying life’s fleeting moments. This juxtaposition beautifully illustrates that even comedic films can deliver powerful lessons about love and humaneness.Conversely, serious films have their own significance as they frequently tackle challenging themes such as societal issues and moral dilemmas. They compel audiences to reflect on the darker facets of human existence, urging viewers to think critically about the world around them. Films like ""Schindler’s List"" and ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" confront themes like suffering, humanity, and resilience, sparking deep conversations long after the credits roll.In conclusion, while entertaining films like ""Click"" can inspire laughter and convey important messages, I lean towards serious movies for their capacity to provoke thought, challenge perceptions, and foster empathy. Ultimately, both genres provide rich experiences, yet the contemplative nature of serious cinema resonates with my desire to explore the complexities of life and society."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;In my point of view, the disadvantages of media's overemphasis on the personal lives of famous individuals vastly outweigh any potential advantages. While public interest in celebrities is undeniable, the obsession with their personal lives often leads to negative consequences that detract from more substantial topics of discussion.First and foremost, the sensationalism surrounding celebrity gossip tends to create misleading narratives. Media outlets are often more focused on boosting sales and attracting attention than on delivering accurate representations of public figures' lives. This not only misrepresents the truth but can also damage the reputations of the individuals involved. Sensational stories, embellished for the sake of excitement, transform ordinary events into grand spectacles, leading the public to form distorted views about these individuals. The consequence is a society that values spectacle over substance, prioritizing drama over real achievements or contributions.Moreover, the relentless focus on celebrities and their personal affairs serves as a significant distraction from pressing public and social issues. Important topics such as climate change, economic inequality, and political corruption are frequently overshadowed by tabloid headlines detailing the latest celebrity breakups or fashion faux pas. This diversion can hinder public discourse, as individuals become more consumed with the lives of the rich and famous rather than engaging with the realities that affect their communities.In conclusion, while there may be some appeal to following the lives of public figures, the negative impacts of media sensationalism are profound. The focus on celebrity gossip misleads the public and diverts attention from critical social issues. In an age where information and awareness are paramount, it is essential to prioritize substantive reporting over sensational storytelling.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;As a lover of travel, I find that visiting museums is often the quintessence of any tour, serving as a bridge between the past and present and allowing travelers to connect deeply with new cultures. There are numerous reasons why people prioritize museum visits when exploring unfamiliar destinations, but two primary motivations stand out: the ability to understand the history and customs of a place, and the opportunity to broaden one’s horizons.Firstly, museums serve as repositories of a region's history, art, and culture. For instance, when visiting the Louvre in Paris, one can immerse oneself in centuries of French history, from ancient artifacts to Renaissance masterpieces. This deep dive into a place's heritage allows travelers to appreciate the cultural context that has shaped modern society. By learning about local traditions, historical events, and artistic movements, visitors gain a comprehensive understanding of their destination, enriching their travel experience.Secondly, museums foster personal growth by expanding visitors' perspectives. Ever since I visited the British Museum, I have been captivated by the immense diversity of human experience it showcases. Encountering artifacts from different civilizations not only highlights our similarities but also emphasizes the uniqueness of varied cultures. Museums spark curiosity and provoke thought, encouraging travelers to reflect on their own beliefs and values while challenging their preconceived notions.In conclusion, people visit museums because they offer invaluable insights into the history and customs of new places and provide opportunities for personal and intellectual growth. Each museum visit becomes not just a simple excursion but a meaningful experience that enhances our understanding of the world and our place within it. By appreciating the richness of human culture, we not only enrich our travels but also expand our own horizons, making every trip a transformative journey.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";In the evolving landscape of education, the choice between studying at home using technology and attending a traditional school presents distinct advantages and challenges. While studying at home offers unrivaled convenience with resources easily accessible via computers or televisions, I would prefer the traditional school experience for several compelling reasons.The allure of online education lies in its flexibility, allowing students to learn at their own pace and accommodate personal schedules. However, this flexibility often comes with significant drawbacks. Completing a course at home can pose difficulties, particularly for students who thrive in structured environments. Home studying lacks the immediate support that classroom settings provide, where educators can share their expertise and offer real-time feedback. The isolation of distance education can hinder motivation and engagement, as students might find it challenging to maintain discipline without the external structure of a school environment.Moreover, traditional schools foster vital socialization opportunities that are essential for holistic development. In a classroom, students are surrounded by peers and teachers, facilitating the establishment of meaningful relationships. These interpersonal interactions teach essential life skills, such as teamwork, empathy, and conflict resolution. Computers and televisions, while powerful learning tools, cannot replicate the nuances of human interaction. They do not teach us how to communicate effectively or interact with diverse perspectives, both of which are critical skills in today's interconnected world.In conclusion, while technological advances may simplify many aspects of learning, the traditional school setting offers irreplaceable social experiences and supports academic success. The opportunity to engage with teachers and classmates in a shared physical space is invaluable, making the traditional approach to schooling the preferred choice for a well-rounded educational journey.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;The announcement of a large shopping center being built in our neighborhood has generated significant discussion among residents. I support this plan for several compelling reasons that directly benefit our community.Firstly, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide residents with a much more convenient place to shop. Currently, many of us must travel considerable distances to find essential goods and services, often facing traffic and long lines. With a shopping center nearby, we would have immediate access to a variety of stores, ranging from grocery outlets to clothing retailers, all in one location. This convenience is especially important for families, elderly residents, and those with busy schedules who may not have the time or means to travel far for shopping. Additionally, a shopping center is likely to stimulate competition among retailers, which can lead to lower prices for consumers. With multiple stores offering similar products, customers can compare prices and choose the best deals, fostering an environment where affordability is prioritized. As a result, our community members could save money when purchasing everyday items, which is particularly beneficial during financially challenging times. Moreover, a shopping center can help save time for residents. Rather than making multiple trips to different locations, they can accomplish all their shopping in one visit. The time saved can then be redirected towards other important aspects of life, such as spending time with family or engaging in community activities. In conclusion, while there may be concerns about increased traffic and noise that come with a new shopping center, the advantages of convenience, lower prices, and time savings significantly outweigh these potential drawbacks. A shopping center would enhance our neighborhood by improving our overall shopping experience and contributing to a more vibrant and accessible community.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";"In today’s fast-paced world, the ability to manage stress effectively has become an indispensable skill for achieving success. Stress, the body's response to any form of demand, can arise from both positive and negative experiences. In the frenetic environment that characterizes our lives — from the pressures of academic expectations to the demands of professional commitments — stress management is crucial for maintaining mental health and achieving sustained productivity.One notable reason why stress management is essential is that chronic stress can lead to burnout, anxiety, and depression, which affects individuals of all ages. Young students face mounting pressures to excel academically, while professionals grapple with the demands of tight deadlines and workplace dynamics. The consequences of unmanaged stress can be devastating, leading to decreased motivation and a decline in physical health. For example, a study may reveal that professionals who develop effective stress management strategies, such as mindfulness and time management techniques, report higher levels of job satisfaction and productivity than those who do not.Moreover, learning to manage stress equips individuals with the resilience needed to navigate challenges. For instance, when faced with setbacks, those who practice stress management techniques are better positioned to bounce back and focus on solutions rather than succumbing to negativity. This resilience is not only integral for personal well-being but is also attractive to employers who seek adaptable and proactive team members. In conclusion, in a world where stress is ubiquitous, mastering the art of managing it is not just beneficial; it is vital for success. Individuals who invest time in developing this skill will find themselves better prepared to tackle challenges and ultimately enjoy a more fulfilling and productive life. Stress management, therefore, stands as a foundational skill in our contemporary society."
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";"Groups and organizations play a vital role in many people's lives, fulfilling diverse needs in personal development, socialization, and skill enhancement. The significance of being part of a collective experience cannot be understated; these entities provide individuals with opportunities to gain meaningful experiences and achieve their goals.Firstly, engagement in groups or organizations offers a structured environment where people can pursue their ambitions. For instance, joining a professional organization can help individuals network, gain mentorship, and access resources that facilitate career advancement. Similarly, clubs or sports teams enable members to hone their skills while achieving specific objectives, such as winning a championship or completing a community project. This not only encourages personal growth but also fosters a sense of accomplishment that can significantly boost self-esteem.Moreover, groups play an essential role in the socialization process, initiating individuals into the norms and values of their respective cultures. From childhood through adulthood, these interactions shape personalities and influence behaviors. For example, children learn cooperation and empathy in group settings such as schools and sports teams, which are fundamental social skills. As adults, participation in community organizations allows them to engage in discussions that broaden their perspectives and deepen their understanding of diverse viewpoints, essential for navigating a multicultural world.Finally, a solid group can provide an appropriate environment for self-improvement and expanding horizons. Whether through book clubs, study groups, or volunteer organizations, these settings encourage individuals to challenge themselves and embark on journeys of personal and intellectual growth. Members are often inspired by each other’s talents and passions, which ignites a desire to pursue new interests or develop new skills. In conclusion, groups and organizations are pivotal in individual lives by creating opportunities for goal achievement, facilitating socialization, and fostering environments that enhance personal development. Their impact is profound, shaping not only the identities of the individuals involved but also the communities in which they reside."
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;The announcement of a new university to be constructed in our community has sparked considerable debate among residents. While many view this initiative as a significant opportunity for growth and development, it is essential to weigh both the advantages and disadvantages that accompany such a project.One of the most compelling advantages of establishing a university in our community is the increased access to higher education. Currently, many residents have limited options for pursuing their studies. A local university would provide numerous educational opportunities, enabling students to remain close to home while obtaining degrees in various fields. This accessibility could lead to a more educated workforce, attracting businesses and stimulating the local economy. Moreover, the university could foster a culture of learning and innovation, encouraging lifelong education among community members.Additionally, the university may enhance community spirit by serving as a hub for social interactions, cultural events, and research initiatives. It can facilitate collaborations with local schools, businesses, and governments, further enriching the community experience.However, the establishment of a university is not without its drawbacks. One potential disadvantage is the increase in social problems typically associated with a student population. For example, there may be a rise in noise pollution, unofficial housing arrangements, and partying, which could disrupt the peaceful environment that residents currently enjoy. Additionally, the influx of students may strain local resources, such as housing, transportation, and essential services, possibly leading to higher living costs for long-standing residents.Moreover, there could be concerns regarding the potential construction disruption, with noise and traffic congestion affecting daily life during the building phase. In conclusion, while the prospect of a new university presents valuable opportunities for our community, it also raises concerns that need to be addressed. Careful planning and collaboration between the government, university officials, and community members will be essential for maximizing the benefits while mitigating the potential downsides.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";The debate over whether the government should provide free college education to every citizen is a contentious issue that generates diverse opinions. Proponents argue that access to education is a fundamental right that should be available to all, regardless of financial background. They believe that free tuition would promote equality, reduce student debt burdens, and ultimately lead to a more educated workforce that can benefit society. However, I contend that individuals should be responsible for financing their own college education, as this approach addresses financial feasibility and promotes personal accountability.Firstly, the financial implications of implementing a nationwide free college education system would be enormous. Funding such a program could lead to a significant increase in government spending. To sustain this initiative, taxes would likely have to be raised, resulting in a burden on taxpayers, including those who do not attend college or who have already paid for their education. These continuous tax hikes could foster widespread discontent and hinder economic growth.Moreover, viewing college education as a personal choice emphasizes personal responsibility and commitment. Education is a valuable investment, and individuals need to recognize the importance of funding their own aspirations. Paying for one's education can instill a greater sense of accountability, encouraging students to take their studies seriously and be mindful of their financial commitments. It also fosters a culture of hard work and perseverance, traits essential for success in both academic pursuits and later in life.In conclusion, while the idea of free college education is appealing and rooted in ideals of equality, the potential financial consequences and the importance of personal responsibility outweigh the perceived benefits. Individuals should be empowered to take charge of their educational choices and bear the financial responsibility that accompanies them.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";The statement that television has destroyed communication among friends and family is a contentious one, reflecting the dual nature of this powerful medium. While I recognize the concerns surrounding television's impact on interpersonal relationships, I ultimately disagree with the notion that it has irrevocably damaged communication among friends and family.Television offers several benefits that can enhance rather than hinder communication. For instance, it provides an avenue for relaxation, allowing individuals to unwind after a long day. This shared experience can foster discussions among family members about what they have watched together, transforming passive viewing into an engaging dialogue. Moreover, television serves as a vital source of information, keeping viewers informed about local and global events. Such knowledge can stimulate conversations and encourage family members to discuss their views, thereby enhancing their understanding of one another’s perspectives.Furthermore, television broadens our horizons by introducing us to diverse experiences and cultures. Shows that depict different lifestyles can prompt important conversations about life choices, values, and societal issues, thereby encouraging families to explore and appreciate diversity together. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that television can negatively influence behavior, particularly in children. It is true that children often emulate what they see on screen, sometimes mimicking behaviors that are not aligned with parental values. This highlights the need for parental guidance and involvement in television consumption. Parents can use television as a tool to teach their children critical thinking skills, emphasizing the distinction between entertainment and reality.In conclusion, while television does present challenges to communication among friends and family, it also offers numerous opportunities for connection and engagement. Rather than solely attributing the destruction of communication to television, it is essential for families to find a balance, harnessing its potential as a catalyst for meaningful discussions while remaining mindful of its pitfalls.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life.";"I wholeheartedly agree that attending a live performance, such as a football match, is far more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. My profound love for football, particularly for my home team, accentuates this sentiment. The experience of being in the stadium, surrounded by thousands of passionate fans, creates an atmosphere of camaraderie and excitement that television simply cannot replicate.First and foremost, attending a live football match is incredibly fulfilling. The thrill of witnessing the game unfold right before my eyes, as football stars demonstrate their skills, is a privilege that brings immense joy. I remember the last match I attended, where I could feel every tackle, every goal, and every cheer from the crowd as if it were happening directly to me. The visceral excitement is intense; with each goal scored, the roar of approximately 40,000 fans erupting in unison is electrifying, creating an unparalleled sense of shared victory or despair.Moreover, the emotional highs and lows of the game are magnified in a stadium setting. Cheering alongside devoted fans fosters a sense of community that enriches the experience. Together, we laugh, shout, and react collectively to the game’s twists and turns. There is a unique joy in high-fiving a stranger when our team scores, something that feels hollow when watching alone at home.While tickets to these events can be costly, the value derived from the experience far exceeds the financial investment. The live atmosphere, the shared moments of joy and sorrow, and the palpable energy of the crowd elevate the enjoyment of the sport to new heights. In conclusion, witnessing football live is not just about the game; it’s about the feeling of being part of something greater, making every moment spent in the stadium a treasured memory."
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";"Renewable resources of energy, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, are increasingly recognized as vital components of both current and future energy strategies. Many proponents argue that these sources will soon replace fossil fuels like oil, coal, and natural gas. While it is clear that renewables have a key role to play in reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainability, I contend that they cannot replace fossil fuels in the immediate future primarily due to technological limitations and relative costs.Technological advancements in renewable energy have made significant strides in recent years; however, they are still in nascent stages compared to the long-established fossil fuel industry. The infrastructure required for harvesting, storing, and distributing renewable energy remains inadequate in many regions. Solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric systems can be intermittently inefficient, depending on geographic and climatic conditions. For example, solar energy is less effective during cloudy days or at night, while wind energy relies heavily on the availability of wind. This inconsistency can lead to challenges in maintaining a stable energy supply, necessitating the reliance on fossil fuels during periods of low renewable generation.Moreover, the initial investment for renewable technologies can be considerably high. Although the costs of solar and wind energy technologies have been decreasing, they are still relatively expensive compared to fossil fuels, especially in areas where fossil resources are abundant and economically accessible. This financial barrier inhibits many regions, particularly developing countries, from fully embracing renewable energy solutions at a pace that would enable them to replace fossil fuels quickly.In conclusion, while renewable energy sources are essential for a sustainable future, they are unlikely to replace fossil fuels in the short term due to technological constraints and economic factors. A balanced approach that includes the gradual integration of renewables, coupled with the continued use of fossil fuels during the transition phase, may be the most pragmatic way forward."
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;The debate over the prioritization of human needs for farmland, housing, and industry versus the necessity of preserving land for endangered animals is becoming increasingly prominent in today’s society. While it is understandable that some people believe the development of land for agricultural and industrial purposes is more beneficial for humanity, I respectfully disagree with this viewpoint. Protecting endangered species and their habitats is crucial for maintaining ecological balance, which ultimately supports human life as well.Supporters of prioritizing land for human use often argue that agricultural expansion and industrial development provide tangible benefits to society. For instance, cultivating more farmland can lead to increased food production, meeting the demands of a growing population, while real estate development addresses the urgent need for housing. Moreover, industry growth can stimulate local economies, creating jobs and reducing unemployment rates, which in turn can mitigate crime rates associated with economic despair.While these points are indeed valid, they overlook the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the vital role that biodiversity plays in human survival. Healthy ecosystems provide essential services such as clean air and water, pollination of crops, and natural pest control. The extinction of endangered species and habitat degradation can result in adverse consequences that threaten food security and human health in the long run.Furthermore, the argument about job creation often fails to consider the sustainable job potential in conservation and ecotourism. By protecting endangered species and their habitats, communities can develop alternative economic opportunities that foster environmental stewardship while still providing employment.In conclusion, while it is crucial to address human needs for agriculture, housing, and industry, prioritizing the preservation of endangered animals and their habitats ultimately serves humanity best. A balanced approach that considers ecological sustainability will yield long-term benefits for both society and the planet.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;The debate over whether learning a foreign language in its native country is more beneficial than studying it elsewhere has garnered considerable attention. While both approaches have merits, I strongly agree that immersing oneself in the culture and environment of the language yields deeper and more nuanced understanding compared to learning it in a country where another language predominates.Language acquisition is intricately tied to culture. When individuals learn a foreign language in its country of origin, they are exposed to authentic contexts in which the language is used daily. This immersive experience allows learners to develop not just linguistic skills, but also cultural knowledge. They engage with native speakers, experience local customs, and navigate real-life scenarios, enhancing their ability to use the language effectively and appropriately. For instance, a person living in Spain while studying Spanish will internalize colloquialisms, nuances, and accents that would be challenging to grasp in a classroom setting in their own country.Conversely, a learner like person 'A', who studies a foreign language in their native country, may benefit from structured, step-by-step teaching methods. This approach can lead to a clear understanding of grammar and vocabulary. However, despite these foundational skills, person 'A' may struggle with practical application. The limitations of a classroom setting can hinder the development of conversational fluency and cultural understanding, which are critical for true language mastery. Without the opportunity to practice daily in real contexts, learners may find themselves ill-prepared when conversing with native speakers.In conclusion, while structured classroom learning has its advantages, the immersive experience of learning a foreign language in its native country fosters a deeper understanding of linguistic and cultural complexities. Thus, the benefits of cultural immersion and real-life practice make learning a foreign language in its original territory an unparalleled approach to truly mastering that language.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";"The debate over whether physical exercise should be a mandatory component of every school day or if students should concentrate solely on academics is complex. However, I firmly believe that incorporating exercise into the daily routine of students is essential for both their physical and mental well-being.Physical exercise is crucial not only for maintaining a healthy body but also for enhancing mental health. Engaging in regular physical activity helps reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, which are increasingly prominent issues among students. Exercise stimulates the release of endorphins, often referred to as ""feel-good"" hormones, which can elevate mood and improve overall emotional resilience. Furthermore, studies have shown that physical activity has a positive impact on cognitive function, aiding in memory retention, focus, and critical thinking. This means that students who incorporate exercise into their daily routine may actually enhance their academic performance.Moreover, establishing a routine that includes exercise from an early age instills in children the importance of incorporating physical activity into their lifelong habits. By making exercise a priority during school days, we teach students to value not just academic achievements but their physical health as well. As young people develop this balance, they are more likely to continue prioritizing exercise in their adult lives, which can lead to healthier lifestyles overall.In conclusion, having physical exercise as a required part of the school day is essential for fostering both physical health and cognitive development in students. The benefits go beyond just fitness; they encompass improved mental well-being and life skills that children will carry into adulthood. Therefore, schools should embrace the importance of physical activity as an integral part of the educational experience, ensuring that future generations can thrive both academically and physically."
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;In some countries, the trend of teenagers taking on jobs while they are still in school has become increasingly common. However, in my opinion, this practice is not a good idea for several reasons, as it can interfere with their lives in significant ways.Firstly, balancing a job and academic responsibilities can negatively impact a teenager's health. When students work long hours, they often sacrifice sleep and leisure time, which are crucial for their physical and mental well-being. A lack of sleep can lead to exhaustion, reduced cognitive function, and even stress-related illnesses. The pressure of juggling work and studies can lead to anxiety and burnout, ultimately affecting their overall health and academic performance.Moreover, taking on a job can divert a teenager's focus from their studies. Education should be a priority during these formative years, as it lays the foundation for future success. When students dedicate time to work, they may find it challenging to complete assignments and prepare for exams, leading to lower grades. This distraction can diminish their enthusiasm for learning, making it difficult for them to fully engage in their education and extract the maximum benefit from their schooling.Lastly, working at a young age can rob teenagers of their childhood phase, an essential period for personal development. This stage is meant for exploration, friendship, and learning without the burdens of adult responsibilities. Jobs often demand a level of maturity and commitment that can stifle a teenager’s ability to enjoy life’s simple pleasures and foster creativity.In conclusion, while having a job might seem like a way for teenagers to gain experience and independence, the potential negative consequences on their health, academic focus, and personal development far outweigh the benefits. It is crucial for teenagers to prioritize their education and enjoy their youth, setting the stage for a successful future without the pressures of early work commitments.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;Zoos have been a part of human culture for centuries, serving as places where people can observe animals from various parts of the world. Over time, they have evolved into institutions that offer entertainment and educational resources. While some people vehemently argue that the existence of zoos is a brutal practice that confines animals unfairly, I believe that, if managed ethically, zoos can serve a useful function for both humanity and wildlife conservation.First and foremost, zoos provide a unique opportunity for people to connect with animals they might never encounter in their natural habitats. For many, especially children, visiting a zoo can be a thrilling experience that fosters a love for wildlife and nurtures an understanding of different species. Educational programs offered by reputable zoos can deepen awareness about biodiversity and the challenges faced by various species in the wild, such as habitat destruction and climate change. This educational aspect is crucial for promoting conservation efforts and encouraging future generations to engage in protecting our planet.Moreover, zoos often play an essential role in species conservation. Many modern zoos actively participate in breeding programs for endangered species, which can help prevent their extinction. Controlled environments allow for the study of animal behavior and health that would be difficult to conduct in the wild, further contributing to conservation strategies.Despite these benefits, it is essential to acknowledge the ethical concerns regarding animal welfare in captivity. Critics argue that confinement can lead to stress and suffering for animals. However, well-managed zoos strive to create environments that prioritize the animals' well-being and replicate their natural habitats to the best of their abilities.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns surrounding the ethics of keeping animals in captivity, I believe that zoos, when operated responsibly, can be instrumental in entertainment, education, and biodiversity conservation. It is crucial for society to focus on improving these institutions to ensure they align with ethical standards and contribute positively to both animals and people.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;When it comes to studying, students often have differing preferences based on their personality and learning style. Personally, I strongly prefer studying in a group with my friends, as it provides numerous advantages that enhance my educational experience.One of the primary benefits of group studying is the opportunity to receive help from my peers. When tackling complex subjects, I often encounter concepts that are challenging to grasp on my own. In a group setting, I can turn to my friends for clarification or different perspectives. For instance, while studying calculus, a friend explained a particularly complicated theorem in a way that made it much easier for me to understand. This collaborative learning not only helps me absorb the material more effectively but also allows me to assist others, reinforcing my own knowledge in the process.Moreover, studying with a group enhances my learning skills. Group study sessions often entail discussions, debates, and explanations, which sharpen my critical thinking and communication abilities. These skills are not only beneficial for my academic performance but also invaluable in real-world scenarios. For example, when conducting group projects or preparing presentations, the experience I gain from collaborative studying equips me with the tools needed to articulate my thoughts clearly and engage in constructive dialogues.In addition to these academic benefits, studying with friends creates a sense of camaraderie and motivation. The social aspect of learning fosters an enjoyable environment where we can share ideas, resources, and even a few laughs. This supportive atmosphere decreases stress and can make challenging subjects more approachable.In conclusion, while studying alone has its merits, I am convinced that studying in a group with my friends offers rich opportunities for academic assistance and skill development. It not only enriches my learning experience but also prepares me for future challenges in both my studies and life beyond the classroom.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;Friendship is undoubtedly one of the most important values in our lives, fostering connections that enrich our experiences and provide support. However, individuals have varying preferences when it comes to social interactions. Some people prefer to spend time with just one or two close friends, while others thrive in the company of a larger circle. Each choice has its unique advantages.Spending time with a few close friends can lead to deep, meaningful relationships. This intimacy allows for open communication, trust, and emotional support that often cannot be replicated in larger groups. Close friends are usually more aware of each other’s feelings and can provide specialized help during difficult times. Additionally, these smaller interactions often lead to shared activities that can strengthen bonds, such as exploring common interests and creating memories together.On the other hand, spending time with a larger number of friends allows for a broader range of experiences and perspectives. Engaging with diverse individuals exposes one to varying viewpoints and life stories, enriching one's understanding of the world. It can stimulate personal growth as different friends might introduce new ideas, hobbies, or challenges. Furthermore, larger social circles can also enhance opportunities for networking, offering social support during significant life events, such as career changes or relocations.In my view, I prefer the latter approach of maintaining a larger circle of friends. Engaging with many different people provides a wealth of learning experiences derived from their diverse backgrounds and insights. Each friend brings their unique attributes that can shape my worldview and enhance my personal development. Through these interactions, I not only gain knowledge, but I also cultivate a rich tapestry of relationships, each contributing to my life in different, valuable ways. Thus, embracing a broader circle of friends fosters a fulfilling social life that encourages continuous learning and growth.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The debate regarding whether government funds should prioritize improving roads and highways or enhancing public transportation is significant in addressing environmental and societal needs. With the gradual depletion of natural resources, especially fossil fuels, a focus on public transportation emerges as the more sustainable choice.Investing in public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and subways, allows for a more efficient use of resources. Public transit options can accommodate a significantly larger number of passengers than individual private cars, thereby reducing the overall consumption of oil and gasoline. For instance, a single bus can replace dozens of cars on the road, leading to a remarkable decline in fuel consumption per capita. This is crucial as rising fuel use is directly linked to global warming and increased air pollution. Each car on the road emits harmful pollutants that contribute to climate change and deteriorate air quality. By transitioning more people to public transport, we can decrease these emissions and maintain a healthier environment.Moreover, public transportation fosters social interaction, as it encourages individuals to travel together rather than isolating them in personal vehicles. This promotes a sense of community, as people from diverse backgrounds share spaces and experiences during their commutes. Enhanced public transit systems can become the backbone of urban life, promoting inclusivity and sustainable urban development.In conclusion, while maintaining and improving road infrastructure is important, prioritizing funding for public transportation presents a more sustainable path for both environmental conservation and social interaction. Investing in public transit represents a commitment to reducing pollution, conserving resources, and fostering stronger community ties, making it the clear choice for government spending.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;The debate surrounding the existence of zoos often hinges on contrasting perspectives about the treatment and care of animals. Some proponents argue that zoos serve as vital institutions for the conservation of endangered species and the education of the public. They believe that by keeping animals in controlled environments, we are safeguarding their survival, conducting vital research, and fostering an appreciation for wildlife. However, others maintain that animals, as sentient beings, possess an inherent right to freedom and dignity, suggesting that zoos inherently compromise these rights for the sake of human entertainment and education.In my opinion, we must prioritize the well-being of animals by helping them live safely and comfortably in their natural habitats. The argument that animals are inferior creatures—dismissing their emotional and social complexities—leads to a devaluation of their intrinsic worth. Animals have evolved over millennia to thrive in specific ecosystems, where they establish connections with their environments and fellow species. Keeping them in captivity can lead to psychological distress, as evidenced by behaviors like pacing or self-harming observed in many zoo animals.Moreover, conservation efforts do not necessarily require the confinement of animals in zoos. Modern technology allows us to study and protect wildlife directly in their habitats. Initiatives such as wildlife reserves, sanctuaries, and field studies provide vital support to endangered species while respecting their freedom. Programs that focus on habitat preservation, anti-poaching efforts, and community involvement yield more effective and ethical results.In conclusion, while some argue that zoos contribute positively to animal welfare and conservation, I firmly believe that true respect for animals and their rights lies in allowing them to live freely in their environments. Instead of caging animals for observation, we should redirect our efforts towards protecting their natural habitats and ensuring their long-term survival.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;In considering the establishment of a new research center in my country, I firmly recommend the development of a center for research in agriculture. This decision is rooted in the pressing need to better exploit our land resources and the potential for significant economic improvements through advancements in the agricultural sector.First and foremost, a center dedicated to agricultural research can provide our citizens with the knowledge and tools necessary to optimize land use. Given that many rural communities still rely heavily on traditional farming practices, there's a vast opportunity to educate farmers on sustainable methods, crop rotation, pest management, and innovative agricultural technologies. By enhancing their skills and using scientific research, farmers can increase their yields and improve the overall quality of their produce, making more efficient use of our country's arable land.Moreover, the agricultural sector is underrepresented in our national economy, accounting for only thirty percent of market participation. Investing in agricultural research could stimulate growth in this critical area, leading to job creation and increased food security. Research initiatives could focus on developing high-yield crop varieties, improving irrigation systems, and introducing climate-resilient practices. Such advancements can not only help in increasing productivity but also in diversifying the country's agricultural output, which is crucial in a world facing unpredictable climate changes.Additionally, enhanced agricultural methods can have a ripple effect on other sectors. When farmers succeed, they contribute to local economies, leading to better livelihoods for families and increased spending in local markets. This, in turn, creates a cycle of economic growth that benefits the entire nation.In conclusion, while both centers for business and agricultural research hold merit, establishing a center focused on agriculture is the more strategic choice for my country. It can drive innovations that leverage our natural resources, transforming the agricultural landscape and, ultimately, boosting our economy.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;Learning is an integral part of human life, and each individual has a unique approach to acquiring knowledge and skills. While some people find solace in reading or listening to lectures, I firmly believe that learning by doing is the most effective method for my personal growth and development. Engaging actively in tasks not only enhances my understanding but also fosters a sense of independence and maturity.When I tackle a new project, whether it be cooking a complex recipe or building a model, I always prefer to dive in headfirst. For example, when I decided to learn how to fix bicycles, I didn't start by reading chapters from manuals or listening to experts. Instead, I obtained a flat tire and set about repairing it on my own. Every mistake taught me an invaluable lesson about mechanics, and I quickly became adept at both fixing bikes and troubleshooting problems.Learning through doing cultivates a sense of responsibility and self-reliance that is often absent in more passive forms of education. When I face a challenge and find a solution, I gain confidence in my abilities. For instance, during a group project in school, my role involved coordinating tasks. Rather than simply listening to my classmates' ideas, I took the initiative to organize the project hands-on, which not only led to a successful outcome but also honed my leadership skills.In conclusion, while reading and listening are valuable tools for learning, I find that engaging directly with tasks provides a more profound understanding and equips me with skills essential for real-world applications. Learning by doing encourages introspection and maturity, enabling me to grow both personally and academically. Through this active method, I not only expand my knowledge but also develop a sense of autonomy that is crucial for my future endeavors.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The debate surrounding cheap air travel often hinges on two contrasting viewpoints. Proponents assert that affordable airfare has revolutionized travel for ordinary people, allowing individuals from lower-income backgrounds to explore new horizons. The democratization of air travel has enabled families to take vacations, friends to visit each other more easily, and adventurers to experience global cultures that might have been inaccessible due to cost constraints. This has undoubtedly enriched lives and broadened perspectives, fostering a sense of global community among diverse populations.However, critics argue that the rise of cheap air travel comes at a significant environmental cost. The aviation industry emits a substantial amount of carbon dioxide, primarily due to the burning of jet fuel. This release of greenhouse gases contributes to the overall warming of the planet, exacerbating climate change. As affordable flights increase in frequency, so do the associated carbon emissions, leading to detrimental effects on ecosystems, weather patterns, and public health. These environmental ramifications raise critical questions about the sustainability of maintaining low-cost travel options.In my opinion, while the accessibility of cheap air travel opens valuable opportunities, it is essential to consider its impact on the environment. We should strive for a balance that allows people to travel economically while also encouraging greener practices within the aviation industry. For instance, investing in fuel-efficient aircraft and promoting carbon offset programs could mitigate some of the environmental damage caused by air travel. Moreover, creating policies that encourage travelers to choose more sustainable modes of transport for shorter distances could reduce the reliance on flying. Ultimately, the challenge lies in finding a solution that continues to empower people while protecting our planet for future generations.
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;"As urban populations continue to grow, the necessity for effective transportation solutions has never been more pressing. Governments face a significant dilemma in allocating resources—should they invest more in improving roads and highways or enhance public transportation systems such as buses, trains, and subways? I firmly believe that governments should prioritize spending on public transportation. One of the foremost reasons for this is the pressing issue of resource allocation. As the number of private vehicles on the roads increases exponentially, it strains our infrastructure and depletes natural resources. Public transportation offers an efficient alternative by accommodating a higher volume of passengers while using substantially less energy per person compared to private cars. By investing in public transit systems, governments can mitigate the overuse of resources associated with a car-centric culture, leading to a more sustainable future.Moreover, air pollution is a critical concern exacerbated by the proliferation of private vehicles. Exhaust emissions from cars contribute significantly to poor air quality and various health issues. Enhancing public transportation can alleviate these problems by reducing the number of cars on the road. A shift to buses and trains means fewer emissions per passenger—leading to cleaner air and healthier communities. Additionally, safety is a paramount consideration; the National Safety Council indicates that riding the bus is over 170 times safer than commuting in personal vehicles. By promoting public transport, governments not only ensure a reliable means of travel but also protect citizens from the risks associated with road traffic accidents.In conclusion, investing in public transportation is a solution that addresses multiple urban issues—from resource depletion and air pollution to safety concerns. Rather than focusing solely on expanding roadways for private vehicles, governments should strategically allocate funds to develop and enhance public transit systems, paving the way for a more sustainable and livable future."
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;The debate over whether to study alone or in a group has long engaged students, and while many find significant benefits in collaborative learning, I personally prefer to study alone. This choice is rooted in my ability to concentrate deeply and the growth of my independence and responsibility.Studying in a group can certainly offer various advantages, such as enhanced motivation and diverse perspectives on challenging material. When students collaborate, they can pool their knowledge and clarify difficult concepts, benefiting from each other’s strengths. Group study sessions can also foster a sense of camaraderie and camaraderie, which can lead to a more enjoyable learning experience. However, these benefits do not outweigh the immense value I find in individual study.One of the primary reasons I prefer to study alone is my enhanced concentration. When I am by myself, I can create an environment tailored to my needs, eliminating distractions that might arise from group dynamics. I can set my own pace, delve into challenging topics without interruptions, and take breaks as needed. This solitary approach allows me to fully immerse myself in the material, resulting in a deeper understanding and retention of knowledge.Moreover, studying alone cultivates essential life skills such as responsibility and independence. When I tackle homework and assignments by myself, I am compelled to take ownership of my learning. This self-driven approach encourages me to seek out resources and solutions independently, promoting a sense of achievement. For instance, completing a difficult assignment without the immediate assistance of peers not only builds my academic skills but also bolsters my self-confidence.In conclusion, while group study may benefit some, I find that studying alone serves me best. The ability to concentrate effectively and the personal growth that comes from independence and responsibility are invaluable. Ultimately, my preference for solitary study aligns with my academic goals and personal development, making it the ideal choice for me.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";The debate surrounding the impact of human activity on the Earth is increasingly pertinent as our actions have profound consequences for the environment. I firmly believe that human activity is primarily harmful to our planet, leading to pollution, resource depletion, and the endangerment of numerous species.Firstly, pollution is one of the most visible manifestations of human activity harming the environment. Factories emit harmful gases, while vehicles contribute significantly to air pollution. In addition, the oceans are suffering from plastic waste, which not only clogs marine habitats but also endangers aquatic life. For instance, sea turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish, leading to fatal consequences. The rise of pollution levels has made various regions uninhabitable, impacting both human and wildlife populations.Moreover, humans are rapidly exhausting natural resources, such as oil and coal. Fossil fuels, once considered a boon for industrialization and technological progress, are now recognized as finite resources that contribute to environmental degradation through greenhouse gas emissions. The extraction processes of these resources also involve deforestation and habitat destruction, leading to a loss of biodiversity. As we continue to rely on these depleting resources, we compromise the planet’s ability to sustain future generations.Additionally, human activity poses a direct threat to other species. Habitat destruction due to urban development and agriculture has dramatically reduced available living spaces for wildlife. The alarming rate at which species are becoming extinct, often as a direct result of human interference, serves as a grim reminder of our impact. For example, the decline in bee populations, which are crucial for pollination, threatens food sources and ecosystems globally.In conclusion, while some argue that human activity contributes positively to the planet, the overwhelming evidence of pollution, resource depletion, and the endangerment of species suggests otherwise. It is imperative that we recognize these issues and take significant steps toward sustainable practices to preserve our Earth for the future.
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";In the discussion of whether a company should allocate funds to support the arts or protect the environment, the pressing condition of our ecosystem strongly favors the latter. Nowadays, the environment is in its most critical state, facing challenges like climate change, deforestation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. If we do not take harsh measures now, we risk irreparable damage. Therefore, it is imperative that companies prioritize environmental protection not only as a moral obligation but as an urgent necessity.Furthermore, investing in environmental initiatives serves as a more effective method of advertising. In today’s world, consumers are increasingly mindful of the ecological impact of their choices. When a company is seen as a leader in sustainability efforts, it not only enhances its public image but also attracts a customer base that is willing to invest in brands aligned with their values. For example, companies like Patagonia have thrived while promoting environmental stewardship, demonstrating that corporate responsibility resonates positively with consumers.Moreover, supporting conservation also leads to a higher standard of living for communities. By investing in environmental protection, businesses contribute to cleaner air, healthier ecosystems, and sustainable practices that enhance the quality of life. For instance, initiatives that protect waterways and forests not only preserve wildlife but also support tourism, agriculture, and recreation, which subsequently boost local economies.In conclusion, while support for the arts undoubtedly enriches culture, the urgent need to protect our environment must take precedence. Given the dire state of our ecosystem, the effective marketing potential of sustainability, and the resulting improvement in living standards, it is clear that the company should choose to support environmental protection. This decision not only addresses immediate challenges but also fosters a sustainable future for generations to come.
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;In any workplace, the dynamics between co-workers can significantly impact productivity and morale. Working closely with others necessitates a harmonious relationship, which is often built on three fundamental characteristics: cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship. Each of these traits plays an essential role in fostering a positive work environment and ensuring collective success.Cooperation is arguably the most critical characteristic of a good co-worker. When team members work collaboratively, tasks become more manageable, and goals are achieved more efficiently. For example, in a marketing team, if members actively share ideas and assist each other in project completion rather than competing, the outcome is often superior. Conversely, a lack of cooperation can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, resulting in wasted time and resources. When disputes arise, the workplace atmosphere becomes strained, ultimately diminishing overall productivity.Equally important is trustworthiness. A good co-worker should be someone whom others can rely on to complete their responsibilities and maintain confidentiality regarding sensitive information. For instance, if a colleague is entrusted with critical project details and respects the privacy of that information, it fosters a culture of reliability and accountability. On the other hand, a lack of trust can lead to a breakdown in communication and an increase in suspicion, negatively affecting team dynamics.Lastly, fellowship, or a sense of camaraderie, is vital in creating a supportive workplace. Good co-workers inspire a sense of belonging, making it easier for team members to communicate openly and share their thoughts without fear of judgment. A friendly atmosphere encourages collaboration and can lead to friendships that extend beyond the workplace, enhancing job satisfaction and reducing stress.In conclusion, cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship are essential characteristics of a good co-worker. Emphasizing these traits can lead to a more productive and harmonious work environment, ultimately benefiting both individuals and the organization as a whole.
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;In today's digital age, the prevalence of distance learning and online computer classes has surged, fundamentally transforming the educational landscape. As technology continues to evolve, online classes have become more appealing and accessible, making education possible for a wider audience. This shift raises an intriguing question: should online computer classes replace traditional classroom learning?One of the primary advantages of online education is its flexibility. Students can learn at their own pace and schedule classes around their personal and professional commitments. This adaptability is particularly beneficial for non-traditional students, such as working adults or parents, who may struggle to find time for conventional class schedules. Furthermore, online learning expands access to quality education, allowing individuals in remote or underserved areas to connect with institutions that would otherwise be unavailable to them.Additionally, online classes often incorporate diverse multimedia resources that can enhance the learning experience. Interactive modules, video lectures, and discussion forums foster engagement and provide various avenues for knowledge retention. The use of technology in education also encourages the development of essential digital skills that are increasingly necessary in today’s job market. However, traditional classroom settings offer important benefits that online learning may lack. Face-to-face interactions foster a sense of community and allow for immediate feedback from peers and instructors, which can significantly enhance the learning experience. Socialization and teamwork, crucial components of education, are often more readily cultivated in a physical classroom environment.In conclusion, while distance learning and online computer classes offer significant benefits in terms of flexibility, accessibility, and technology integration, it is essential to recognize the value of conventional classroom interactions. Rather than completely replacing classroom learning, a blended approach that combines the best elements of both can provide students with a well-rounded and effective educational experience.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes is a contentious one, with valid points on both sides. However, I firmly believe that students should be free to choose whether or not to attend classes. This freedom can enhance student life, boost learning motivation, and equip students with essential life skills. Firstly, allowing students the option to skip classes can significantly improve their overall quality of life. University is a time of immense pressure and transition, often leading to stress and burnout. When students have the autonomy to manage their schedules, they can better balance academic responsibilities with personal interests and self-care. This flexibility enables them to engage in extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, or internships, which contribute to personal growth and holistic development.Moreover, when attendance is optional, students are more likely to attend classes out of genuine interest rather than obligation. This intrinsic motivation fosters a deeper engagement with the material, leading to more meaningful learning experiences. Students who choose to attend classes because they see the value in doing so are likely to retain information better and apply their knowledge more effectively in real-world scenarios.In addition to enhancing learning motivation, the freedom to skip classes teaches vital life skills. Students must learn to prioritize tasks, manage their time, and take responsibility for their own education. These skills are crucial in the workforce, where self-direction and initiative are highly valued. When students are entrusted to make their own decisions regarding class attendance, they are developing the capacity to navigate challenges independently.In conclusion, while some may argue for mandatory class attendance, I believe that allowing students the freedom to choose fosters a more enriching educational environment. This flexibility improves student life, enhances motivation, and cultivates essential life skills, ultimately preparing them for success beyond university.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;When contemplating the ideal place to reside, I firmly believe that living in a small town is far more advantageous than settling in a bustling big city. This preference stems from several compelling factors, including favorable weather, a healthier lifestyle, manageable living costs, and the notion of community.Firstly, small towns often boast a more predictable and pleasant climate. Unlike big cities, which can experience extreme weather fluctuations and pollution, small towns typically enjoy a more temperate environment. This serene weather encourages outdoor activities and promotes a healthier lifestyle, allowing residents to engage more with nature and partake in recreational pursuits without the stress of urban congestion.Additionally, living in a small town fosters a healthier life. With less traffic, noise, and pollution, small towns provide an environment conducive to physical and mental well-being. Residents can partake in everyday activities like walking, cycling, or hiking without the looming threat of city commotion. This ensures a more balanced lifestyle that promotes relaxation and connection with one's surroundings.Economically speaking, living costs in small towns are significantly lower than those in large metropolitan areas. Housing, groceries, and services are often more affordable, relieving some financial pressure that can accompany city living. In smaller communities, residents tend to appreciate the importance of collaboration, often leading to better deals and a more comprehensive support network. This communal spirit contrasts sharply with the anonymity often felt in larger cities, where individuals may struggle to find meaningful connections and support.In conclusion, while both small towns and big cities offer unique experiences, my preference leans towards the tranquility, health benefits, lower living costs, and strong sense of community that small towns provide. Living in such an environment not only nurtures a fulfilling lifestyle but also creates lasting bonds with neighbors.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend of young people migrating from rural areas to urban centers in search of better job prospects and educational opportunities. This phenomenon is prevalent across many countries and can largely be attributed to a few key factors. Firstly, urban areas typically offer a wider range of job opportunities compared to rural regions. The growth of industries, services, and technology in cities provides young individuals with diverse career pathways that may not be available in their hometowns. Additionally, cities often host more educational institutions, allowing for greater access to higher learning and specialized training programs.However, while these opportunities seem appealing, I personally do not approve of this trend due to the negative outcomes it often entails. One significant issue is the lower quality of life that many young migrants experience once they move to cities. The fast-paced urban lifestyle can be overwhelming, and the high cost of living poses financial challenges that can lead to stress and dissatisfaction. In contrast, rural areas often offer a more peaceful environment, closer community ties, and a slower pace of life that many young individuals may miss once they relocate.Moreover, the mass movement of people from rural to urban areas has profound implications for the environment. As cities expand to accommodate the influx of residents, urban sprawl can lead to the destruction of natural habitats, increased pollution, and unmanageable waste. Additionally, this trend often results in the neglect of rural areas, contributing to economic decline and social disintegration in these communities.In conclusion, while the desire for better jobs and educational opportunities drives young people to cities, the disadvantages associated with this migration—such as diminished quality of life and environmental degradation—are concerning. Therefore, I believe that the drawbacks of this trend outweigh its advantages, and addressing the disparities between urban and rural areas should be a priority for policymakers.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;"In today's rapidly evolving society, an understanding of economics is not just beneficial; it is essential. I strongly agree that high school students should take a course in basic economics. As we navigate through an increasingly complex world where economic principles influence our daily lives, being well-versed in the fundamentals of economics equips young individuals with essential skills for the future.Economics is, in many ways, the order of the day. From the decisions we make about spending and saving to the choices we encounter in our career paths, economic principles underpin many aspects of our lives. Introducing economics at the high school level allows students to grasp vital concepts early on, fostering critical thinking about issues like supply and demand, inflation, and market dynamics. The earlier students delve into this subject, the more adept they will become, allowing them to make informed decisions that can significantly affect their personal and professional lives.Moreover, a foundational understanding of economics can play a crucial role in a student's success in college. Many college programs include courses that necessitate an understanding of economic principles, whether they are studying business, political science, or even the social sciences. By taking a basic economics course in high school, students will be better prepared for these advanced studies. They will have a leg up in understanding complex scenarios and can engage more thoughtfully in discussions about fiscal policies, economic theories, and societal impacts.In conclusion, incorporating a basic economics course into high school curricula is crucial. It fosters early engagement with essential economic concepts and dramatically enhances students' preparedness for both college and their future careers, enabling them to navigate the economic challenges of the world with confidence and skill."
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The debate surrounding the accessibility of university education often hinges on whether it should be exclusive to the most outstanding academic students or open to a broader demographic. While I acknowledge the merits of prioritizing exceptional scholars, I argue against restricting university education solely to high achievers, given the multifaceted nature of higher learning.Indeed, outstanding academic students possess an intellectual advantage that often makes them well-suited for the rigors of university studies. Their proficiency in critical thinking and problem-solving equips them to excel in an environment that thrives on intellectual challenge. However, limiting university education to only the top academic performers neglects the myriad talents and perspectives that contribute to a dynamic society.University serves as a venue not just for academic pursuits but also as a fertile ground for nurturing artistic talent and developing essential soft skills, such as teamwork, communication, and resilience. Many students may not excel in traditional academic settings yet possess remarkable creativity or practical skills that can enrich the university experience and benefit their peers. By embracing a wider range of talents, universities can foster a more inclusive environment that amplifies diverse voices and prepares students for the complexities of real-world challenges.In conclusion, while there are advantages to admitting only those with exceptional academic prowess—such as maintaining high educational standards—the restrictions on university access can have detrimental effects. A narrow focus risks stifling innovation and neglecting individuals who could contribute significantly in non-academic ways. Thus, rather than enforcing stringent admission criteria, universities should strive to balance excellence with inclusivity, ensuring that a broader spectrum of young people can take advantage of the transformative opportunities that higher education offers.
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The adage ""prevention is better than cure"" holds significant weight in today’s health discourse, particularly in the context of a welfare state where governments are tasked with the responsibility of safeguarding the health of their citizens. The allocation of a country's health budget is critical to the overall effectiveness of public health systems. I firmly believe that a substantial proportion of this budget should be diverted from treatment options to health education and preventative measures.In contemporary society, the increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular conditions, underscores the importance of preventive health strategies. By investing in health education, governments can empower citizens to make informed decisions about their lifestyle choices, leading to reduced incidences of preventable diseases. Preventative measures such as vaccination programs, regular health screenings, and public health campaigns can significantly reduce the burden on healthcare services, alleviating the need for costly treatments and hospitalizations later on.Furthermore, the principle of the welfare state extends beyond merely providing treatments when health issues arise; it calls for a more holistic approach to health that encompasses both physical and mental well-being. By prioritizing preventive health education, we can foster a healthier population that requires less medical intervention. This not only leads to better health outcomes but also significantly reduces healthcare costs in the long run, allowing resources to be more efficiently utilized.In conclusion, redirecting a greater proportion of the health budget towards education and preventative measures is essential for achieving sustainable healthcare. By prioritizing prevention, we not only improve the overall health of the population but also ensure that limited resources are utilized effectively, thus embodying the true spirit of a welfare state."
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;"In today's competitive educational landscape, there is immense pressure on young people to excel academically, leading some to suggest that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery, should be removed from the school syllabus to allow more time for academics. I firmly disagree with this notion, as non-academic subjects are essential for holistic development and play a critical role in shaping well-rounded individuals.Firstly, non-academic subjects contribute to students' physical and mental well-being. Physical education, for instance, encourages an active lifestyle, which is crucial in combating rising obesity rates and promoting overall health. If such classes were eliminated, students could face considerable negative effects on their health, both in the short and long term. Physical fitness is not solely about exercise; it fosters discipline, teamwork, and resilience—qualities valuable across various life contexts.Moreover, schools bear the responsibility of cultivating well-rounded individuals prepared for the multifaceted challenges of life. Success cannot be determined by academic achievements alone; practical life skills are equally vital. Subjects like cookery not only teach essential culinary skills but also promote healthy eating habits and self-sufficiency. By prioritizing academic subjects exclusively, we risk overshadowing the importance of emotional intelligence, creativity, and social skills that are developed through non-academic disciplines. Furthermore, many successful individuals in various fields attribute their achievements to both their academic foundation and the life lessons learned from engaging in physical education, arts, or home economics.In conclusion, while academic success is important, a well-rounded education that includes non-academic subjects contributes significantly to a student's overall development. Schools should not only prioritize academic excellence but also recognize the vital role of physical and practical education in preparing students for a balanced and fulfilling life."
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When people move to another country, they often encounter the pivotal decision of whether to embrace the customs of their new home or to maintain their original traditions. This choice can greatly influence their integration and sense of belonging in the new society. On one hand, adapting to the customs of the new country can facilitate smoother assimilation. By embracing local customs, individuals often find common ground with their new neighbors, fostering social relationships and reducing cultural barriers. For instance, participating in local celebrations or learning the language can enhance one's sense of belonging and open up opportunities for social and professional networking. Such experiences can ease the transition and help newcomers feel more comfortable in their new environments.Conversely, some individuals choose to preserve their original customs. This choice allows them to maintain their cultural identity and heritage. However, opting to keep one’s traditions can sometimes create a sense of separation from the local populace. By refusing to adapt, these individuals may be perceived as forming an insular community, which can hinder their ability to connect with others outside their cultural group. While this preservation of identity is legitimate and necessary for many, it may also lead to feelings of isolation or misunderstanding from the dominant culture.Personally, I prefer a balanced approach that incorporates aspects of both choices. While it is vital to honor one’s heritage, embracing and understanding the customs of the new country fosters a richer cultural experience. This hybrid approach can bridge differences and create a more inclusive environment where both original and new customs coexist. In essence, finding a middle ground not only satisfies the desire to retain one’s identity but also enhances the overall experience of living in a multicultural society.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;In today’s fast-paced world, the ability to collaborate with others while working in a team is often heralded as an essential skill. However, despite the importance of teamwork, I firmly believe that the capacity to work independently is even more significant. There are various reasons for this conviction, particularly the necessity of self-sufficiency in academic and professional success.One of the most compelling arguments for valuing independent work is that certain tests and evaluations do not permit collaboration. For instance, standardized exams and school finals are typically individual assessments. Students must demonstrate their personal understanding and mastery of the subject matter without relying on others. Excelling in these assessments is crucial, as they often play a decisive role in college admissions and future career opportunities. Thus, a student who has honed their ability to research, analyze, and synthesize information independently is better positioned to achieve academic success.Furthermore, working independently fosters essential life skills, such as self-discipline, time management, and critical thinking. These skills are invaluable as they empower individuals to tackle challenges and produce high-quality work on their own. For example, consider the case of a student preparing for a crucial exam. By studying alone, they are forced to confront their weaknesses and develop strategies to overcome them, rather than relying on group discussions for clarification.Moreover, independent work encourages creativity and innovation. When individuals explore ideas and solutions without the constraints of a group consensus, they can think outside the box and develop unique approaches to problems. This kind of original thinking can be instrumental in various fields, leading to groundbreaking discoveries and advancements.In conclusion, while teamwork undeniably plays a vital role in many aspects of life, the ability to work independently is ultimately more important. It is crucial for academic success, fosters personal development, and inspires creativity. Therefore, students should focus on cultivating their individual working skills to prepare for the demands of the future.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";In today's fast-paced society, some individuals argue that we should dedicate our time and energy solely to our jobs. However, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint. Engaging in hobbies and physical activities that differ from one's professional life is essential not only for personal well-being but also for enhancing overall productivity and creativity.Firstly, participating in hobbies and physical activities is vital for maintaining good physical health. Regular exercise and activities that engage our interests, such as sports, dancing, or gardening, help keep our bodies fit and reduce the risk of various health issues. When we prioritize these activities, we invest in our physical well-being, allowing us to perform better in our jobs due to increased energy levels and improved focus.Moreover, dedicating oneself to a single pursuit for an extended period can lead to monotony and burnout. Engaging in diverse activities can profoundly refresh our minds. Hobbies provide a creative outlet where individuals can explore new ideas and interests outside the constraints of their careers. This change of pace can help recharge our mental batteries, making us more effective and innovative in our professional roles.Furthermore, hobbies can also serve as an emotional outlet. For instance, playing a musical instrument can be an excellent way to express our feelings, especially during times of distress or pressure. Many individuals find solace in music, using it as a therapeutic practice to cope with stress and anxiety. This emotional release not only benefits personal mental health but can also translate into improved professional performance.In conclusion, while focusing on our jobs is important, it is equally vital to pursue hobbies and engage in physical activities that differ from our work. Such activities provide essential benefits for our physical and mental well-being, offering a balanced approach to life that fosters both personal fulfillment and professional success.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;The question of whether governments should prioritize spending on roads and highways or public transportation is critical in addressing urban challenges. Many countries have faced significant issues related to pollution, noise, and casualties from vehicular accidents. From my perspective, improving roads and highways is the most viable solution to these problems for three essential reasons: enhanced safety, reduced congestion, and economic growth.Firstly, improving roads and highways can lead to increased safety for all road users. Well-maintained roads reduce the likelihood of accidents, as they provide clearer signage, better lighting, and smoother surfaces. Enhanced safety measures, such as pedestrian crossings and bike lanes, can also be integrated into highway designs, minimizing casualties among vulnerable road users. By prioritizing road safety, governments can directly address the alarming rates of traffic-related injuries and fatalities that many communities experience.Secondly, improved road infrastructure helps alleviate traffic congestion. Many cities suffer from gridlock, which not only frustrates commuters but also contributes to air pollution due to idling vehicles. By upgrading existing roadways and expanding highway capacity where necessary, governments can create more efficient transportation networks, enabling faster and more reliable travel. This, in turn, can decrease the amount of time spent in traffic, significantly reducing emissions from vehicles, thus addressing pollution concerns effectively.Lastly, investing in roads and highways can stimulate economic growth. Efficient transport networks facilitate trade and the movement of goods, benefiting businesses and creating jobs. Improved road infrastructure also attracts investment in local communities, as companies seek locations with reliable access to transportation. This leads to a stronger economy and can eventually improve public transportation systems as tax revenues increase.In conclusion, while public transportation is crucial in mitigating long-term urban challenges, prioritizing the improvement of roads and highways offers immediate benefits in safety, congestion, and economic growth. By focusing on these areas, governments can create a healthier, more efficient, and economically vibrant society.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;Learning about life is a complex journey that can be approached in various ways. Two predominant methods are listening to the advice of family and friends and gaining insights through personal experience. Each approach offers distinct advantages that contribute to our understanding of life.Listening to the advice of family and friends is often regarded as a realistic way of learning. These close relationships provide a wealth of knowledge grounded in their experiences, mistakes, and lessons. They can offer guidance in navigating life's challenges, helping us avoid potential pitfalls. This method fosters a sense of community and support, as individuals can draw upon the collective wisdom around them. For example, a parent's advice on managing finances can help steer a young adult away from debt, potentially saving them from difficulties that might arise from poor financial decisions. On the other hand, personal experience holds unique value. Engaging with life directly allows us to develop a deeper understanding of ourselves and our surroundings. Learning from mistakes fosters resilience, adaptability, and critical thinking. When we face challenges head-on, we create lasting memories and insights that shape our identity. The lessons learned from personal experiences are often more impactful, as they are intimately tied to our emotions and consciousness. For instance, someone who takes a risk and starts a business will learn invaluable lessons about perseverance that advice alone may not convey.In conclusion, both listening to advice and learning through personal experience have their merits. While advice provides a practical roadmap that can help us navigate complex situations, personal experience cultivates resilience and self-discovery. Personally, I believe that combining both methods is preferable. Hence, one can benefit from external insights while also embracing the transformative power of lived experiences, creating a well-rounded approach to understanding life.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;In my opinion, childhood is indeed the happiest time of a person's life. This period is characterized by a unique blend of innocence, curiosity, and freedom that tends to diminish as one transitions into adulthood. Most people tend to recall their formative years as a time of joy, laughter, and wonder, often looking back on them with nostalgia.One primary reason childhood is often seen as the happiest time is due to the simplicity of daily life. Children are typically engaged in a routine that revolves around school, playing, and sleeping, which allows them to experience each day as an adventure. School introduces them to the world of learning but is often balanced with ample time for fun and creativity. The act of playing, whether it be outdoor games, imaginative role-play, or engaging with toys, fosters an environment of joy and spontaneity. In contrast, adulthood brings a multitude of responsibilities, pressures, and stressors that can overshadow the joy experienced in one's childhood.Moreover, creativity flourishes in childhood. Children possess an innate ability to imagine and create without the constraints that oftentimes accompany adult life. Their unfiltered thoughts and boundless enthusiasm lead to exploration of new ideas, experiences, and friendships. This creative spirit enriches their well-being and contributes to an overall sense of happiness. As adults, many find that the rigors of life can stifle this creative impulse, causing a longing for the carefree nature of childhood.In conclusion, while happiness can be found throughout life, childhood stands out as a truly unique and cherished time. The simplicity of life as a child, coupled with the innate creativity and unburdened joy that characterize those years, makes it the happiest period for many individuals.
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;In recent years, advances in technology have revolutionized how we prepare food, leading to significant improvements in the way people live. With the introduction of various kitchen appliances, such as microwave ovens and toasters, meal preparation has become quicker and much more convenient than ever before. This transformation not only streamlines cooking processes but also enriches the lives of individuals, especially those managing household responsibilities.One of the most significant benefits of these technological advancements is the liberation of housewives from the tedious and time-consuming nature of traditional cooking. In the past, preparing a meal often required hours of chopping, simmering, and boiling. The introduction of appliances like microwaves allows individuals to cook meals in just a fraction of the time, making it possible to heat ready-made dishes in minutes. Moreover, devices such as toasters and multi-cookers have simplified the process of making breakfast or other meals, enabling people to easily prepare healthy options without extensive effort.The time saved in the kitchen has opened up numerous opportunities for individuals, particularly homemakers, to engage in more meaningful activities. With less time devoted to meal preparation, housewives can pursue hobbies, spend quality time with family, or even further their education. This shift not only enhances personal satisfaction but can also contribute to improved mental health, as individuals feel less overwhelmed and more accomplished in various areas of their lives.Additionally, the ease of food preparation has fostered the potential for healthier eating habits. With ready access to quick and nutritious meal options, individuals can make better food choices that align with their health goals. This focus on nutrition further contributes positively to overall well-being.In conclusion, the advancements in food preparation technologies have significantly improved daily living. By streamlining cooking processes, these innovations have granted people more time to focus on personal growth and family, all while encouraging healthier dietary habits. The ease with which meals can now be prepared has brought about a positive shift in lifestyle, elevating the quality of life for many.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;The debate on whether young adults should seek independence from their parents or continue living with them for an extended period is complex and often hinges on individual circumstances. However, I firmly believe that staying at home longer can be more beneficial for young adults for several reasons, including the opportunity to create cherished memories, financial savings, and the valuable advice that parents can offer.First and foremost, living with parents allows young adults to forge lasting memories that can strengthen family bonds. Shared experiences, such as family dinners, celebrations, and even regular outings, contribute to a sense of belonging and togetherness. These memories are essential as they foster emotional support during transitional phases of life, enabling young adults to build a strong familial foundation before embarking on their independent journeys.In addition to emotional benefits, residing with parents often results in significant financial savings. Young adults can avoid burdensome expenses associated with housing, such as rent and utilities. This financial cushion can enable them to save for future endeavors, such as purchasing a home or pursuing higher education, which may have otherwise been difficult to achieve if they had rushed into independence. Without the looming pressure of managing bills, young adults can focus on career growth and personal development.Lastly, living at home allows young adults to benefit from the wisdom and advice of their parents. Parents, with their life experiences, can provide valuable guidance on various issues, ranging from career choices to personal relationships. This support can help young adults navigate the complexities of adult life more effectively and confidently.In conclusion, while the allure of independence might be tempting, staying at home longer offers unique advantages, including treasured memories, financial stability, and parental guidance. These benefits can provide a young adult with a more solid foundation for future independence, ultimately leading to a more successful and fulfilling life.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;The statement that a zoo has no useful purpose is one I strongly disagree with. Zoos play a vital role in education, conservation, and tourism, contributing significantly to both wildlife and human society. Firstly, zoos serve as essential educational platforms for people of all ages. They provide opportunities to learn about different animal species, their habitats, and the environmental challenges they face. Through interactive exhibits and educational programs, visitors can gain a deeper understanding of biodiversity and the importance of conservation efforts. For instance, many zoos offer behind-the-scenes tours and workshops that engage students and foster a love for wildlife and nature. This educational aspect is crucial in raising awareness about pressing conservation issues, ultimately inspiring future generations to take action.Secondly, zoos play a pivotal role in the conservation of endangered species. Many zoos are involved in breeding programs aimed at increasing the population of threatened animals, ultimately preventing their extinction. For example, successful breeding programs for species like the California condor and the Arabian oryx have allowed these animals to be reintroduced into their natural habitats. By participating in global conservation efforts, zoos contribute to the stabilization and recovery of vulnerable species, which is critical for maintaining ecological balance.Lastly, zoos are significant tourist attractions that generate economic benefits for local communities. They draw millions of visitors annually, providing jobs and stimulating the economy. This influx of tourists also helps raise funds for conservation programs, ensuring that zoos can continue their important work in animal care and habitat preservation.In conclusion, zoos serve multiple useful purposes, from educational outreach and conservation efforts to economic benefits. They not only enhance our understanding of wildlife but also play a crucial role in protecting endangered species and supporting local economies. For these reasons, I believe zoos are invaluable institutions in today’s society.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;The assertion that parents are the best teachers for young children holds substantial weight, as the influence of parents during the formative years is both profound and foundational. From the moment a child is born, parents serve as their first educators, guiding them through vital early milestones such as walking and speaking. These initial lessons are often laden with love and care, setting the stage for a child’s emotional and social development.Parents teach not only practical skills but also moral values, encouraging children to develop into good individuals. Through everyday interactions, parents instill important lessons about empathy, respect, and responsibility. For instance, a simple act of sharing between siblings or helping a neighbor can encapsulate complex moral teachings. Children learn by observing their parents’ behaviors, therefore, a parent’s own conduct becomes a crucial part of the educational process. Additionally, the nurturing environment that parents create plays a significant role in preparing children for future challenges. Parents strive to provide conditions conducive to their child's development, whether through fostering curiosity or nurturing talents. They often invest considerable time and resources into ensuring access to educational materials, extracurricular activities, and social experiences that promote learning and growth. This support not only equips children with the knowledge but also boosts their confidence, preparing them for the complexities of adult life.While formal education is undeniably important, the lessons imparted by parents lay the groundwork upon which all further learning is built. Ultimately, the unique combination of love, attention, and practical teaching makes parents the best teachers for young children. The enduring bond between parent and child enriches this educational journey, making it not just about learning facts or skills but about developing a well-rounded individual. Thus, I strongly agree that parents play an unparalleled role in shaping their young children's futures.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;"The debate surrounding the influence of television on young children has gained significant attention in recent years. While many argue that television has a detrimental effect on children, particularly due to violent or inappropriate content, I contend that when consumed wisely, television can yield more positive effects than negative.Critics of television highlight its potential risks, citing the prevalence of violent and inappropriate content that can negatively influence impressionable minds. Studies have shown that children exposed to violent programming may become desensitized to violence, exhibit aggressive behavior, and develop fear. Furthermore, the portrayal of unrealistic body images and lifestyles can contribute to issues like low self-esteem and unhealthy expectations among young viewers. These concerns are valid, and they warrant attention in discussions about children's media consumption.However, it is essential to acknowledge the positive aspects of television when used judiciously. Educational programs, documentaries, and shows that promote creativity can enhance learning experiences for children. For instance, programs like ""Sesame Street"" and ""Bluey"" not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons about social skills, problem-solving, and empathy. Such content can stimulate intellectual curiosity and foster critical thinking in young minds.Moreover, in today's digital age, parents have greater control over what their children watch. With the advent of streaming services, families can curate a selection of programs that align with their values and educational goals. By guiding children towards quality content and engaging in discussions about what they watch, parents can help counteract potential negative influences.In conclusion, while it is crucial to remain vigilant about the content children are exposed to, I believe that the negative effects of television can be mitigated through wise choices and active parental involvement. When approached thoughtfully, television has the potential to be a powerful educational tool that enriches children's lives rather than detracts from them."
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;"The proposition that businesses should hire employees for their entire lives is one that, while seemingly stable, neglects the dynamic nature of the modern job market and workforce needs. Many entrepreneurs argue that lifelong employment ensures productivity and efficiency; however, I contend that this perspective is not only conservative but also outdated. From my standpoint, businesses should refrain from committing to lifelong employment for their workers for three main reasons: the need for flexibility, the importance of innovation, and the evolving nature of job roles.First, flexibility is crucial in today’s rapidly changing economy. Industries evolve at an unprecedented pace, driven by technological advancements and shifting consumer demands. Employers who maintain a static workforce may struggle to adapt to these changes. By employing workers on a more flexible basis, companies can pivot and adjust their teams to reflect the skills currently needed for success.Second, fostering innovation requires a variety of perspectives and experiences. When businesses hire for a lifetime, they run the risk of stagnation, as long-term employees may become set in their ways and less open to new ideas. Fresh talent can bring innovative solutions and foster creativity, enhancing the organization’s ability to compete and thrive.Finally, the nature of job roles is continuously transforming. The skills that were relevant a decade ago may not suffice in today’s job market. By creating a culture of periodic hiring and retraining, businesses can ensure that their employees are equipped with the latest skills required to succeed. This approach not only benefits the company but also allows employees to continuously develop their careers rather than becoming complacent.In conclusion, while the idea of lifelong employment may seem appealing, it is essential to recognize the limitations it imposes on both businesses and employees. Flexibility, innovation, and the evolving nature of job roles support the argument that a more dynamic employment model is not just necessary but beneficial for all parties involved."
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";"Many people argue that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life, and I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. The unique experiences and characteristics of childhood contribute to an unparalleled joy that is often unmatched in later years.Firstly, childhood is characterized by a sense of wonder and surprise. As children navigate the world, everything is new and intriguing. Simple things, such as the first snowfall or a day at the zoo, can evoke immense joy and excitement. This sense of discovery fosters a positive outlook on life, as the world seems full of possibilities. I remember the first time I visited an amusement park; the thrill of the rides and the vibrant colors around me created lasting memories filled with happiness.Another significant aspect of childhood is the freedom of imagination. Children have an extraordinary capacity to dream and create. Whether it's pretending to be a superhero or envisioning a world where animals can talk, childhood is a time when imagination knows no bounds. This freedom allows children to express themselves authentically, leading to immense joy. I recall countless afternoons spent playing in my backyard, where the simplest stick became a sword or a magic wand. Such experiences fed my creativity and made me feel invincible.Additionally, children enjoy a unique freedom to voice their thoughts without the fear of judgment that often accompanies adulthood. Their honest, uninhibited expressions often lead to laughter and camaraderie. The whimsical conversations I had with friends during my childhood were filled with laughter and innocence, creating bonds that felt eternal.In conclusion, childhood, with its wonder, imaginative freedom, and carefree expression, is undoubtedly one of the happiest periods in life. These factors combine to create a joy that can be challenging to replicate in adulthood, making childhood a cherished and irreplaceable time in every person’s life."
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";"The assertion that learning about the past holds no value for those of us living in the present is a perspective that overlooks the profound insights history offers. Many people believe that “the past has nothing to do with the present, as time never stops,” suggesting a disconnection between historical events and contemporary existence. However, this viewpoint fails to recognize the lessons embedded in our past, which can provide invaluable guidance for shaping a brighter future.Firstly, history is replete with examples of both mistakes and successes that we can learn from. For instance, the rise and fall of empires illustrates the consequences of political mismanagement, military overreach, and social inequality. By examining these historical lessons, modern leaders can adopt policies that foster stability and avoid repeating the same blunders. Additionally, the successes of previous movements, such as civil rights campaigns, not only inspire current activism but also offer strategies for achieving social change.Furthermore, knowledge across various fields, from science to art, has been built upon the foundations laid in the past. Innovations in technology, medicine, and education are often the result of cumulative knowledge derived from our predecessors' discoveries and theories. Ignoring past achievements and failures stifles progress, as we miss out on the accumulated wisdom that informs current practices.In conclusion, learning about the past is not merely an academic exercise; it is a crucial component of personal and societal growth. By comprehensively engaging with history, we can extract meaningful lessons that guide our decisions today, ultimately paving the way for a more informed and prosperous future. Instead of dismissing the past as irrelevant, we should embrace it, harnessing the knowledge and experiences it offers to create a better world."
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;"The pursuit of outer space has captivated human imagination for centuries, culminating in significant advances during the 20th century, when space exploration became a tangible reality. Governments around the world have invested substantial amounts of money in missions beyond our planet, igniting debates about the reasonableness of such expenditures. In my opinion, this investment is not only justified but essential for the survival and advancement of humanity.Initially, the era of space exploration began as a competition between superpowers, especially during the Cold War, when technological superiority was a primary focus. The race to the moon underscored the importance of space as a platform for military power and national pride. However, the contributions of space exploration extend far beyond military might; they provide invaluable insights into Earth's fragile environment, the cosmos, and the potential for future human habitation beyond our planet.Investing in space exploration can yield significant benefits for humanity. As our planet faces pressing issues such as climate change, resource depletion, and overpopulation, exploring alternative homes becomes increasingly vital. The potential to colonize other planets or harness resources from asteroids may offer us avenues to sustain life as we know it. Moreover, technological innovations resulting from space research have often led to breakthroughs that impact daily life, including advancements in telecommunications, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring.Furthermore, space exploration serves as a unifying endeavor, bringing diverse nations together in pursuits that transcend national boundaries. Collaborative efforts like the International Space Station highlight the importance of collective action in addressing global challenges.In conclusion, while the funds allocated to space exploration may seem extravagant at first glance, they serve critical purposes that aim to safeguard humanity's future. This investment not only fuels scientific discovery and innovation but also promotes international cooperation and inspires generations to reach for the stars."
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";Television is often hailed as one of the greatest innovations of our time, profoundly influencing the way we access information and entertainment. While some people argue that television has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. In fact, television has the potential to enhance communication, foster connections, and stimulate discussions among individuals.Firstly, television serves as a shared experience that can bring friends and family together. Watching a popular show or a significant sporting event creates a communal atmosphere, prompting viewers to discuss plot developments, characters, and outcomes. For instance, when families gather to watch a favorite sitcom, they not only enjoy the storyline but also strengthen their bonds through shared laughter and commentary. This shared experience often leads to deeper conversations about life, values, and personal experiences reflected in the shows they watch.Additionally, television can be an educational tool that fosters communication among family members. Many documentary series and informative programs address current social issues, history, and culture, encouraging viewers to engage in meaningful conversations. For example, a family that watches a documentary about climate change might discuss personal choices and community initiatives to reduce their environmental footprint. Such discussions stem from initial exposure to new ideas through television and can inspire collective action.Moreover, the rise of social media has allowed viewers to participate in broader conversations surrounding their favorite shows, transcending geographic boundaries. Fans can engage in discussions online, share their thoughts, and even connect with others who have similar interests. This connectivity can enhance relationships, extending conversations beyond the television screen and into real-life interactions.In conclusion, while some may contend that television disrupts communication, I firmly believe that it enriches it. By fostering shared experiences and stimulating educational conversations, television can enhance connections among friends and family, ultimately contributing to a more informed and engaged society.
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;The debate on whether letting a friend make a mistake is better than intervening and risking a friendship is a nuanced one. While both perspectives hold weight, I strongly agree that allowing a friend to learn from their mistakes is a more favorable approach. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion.Firstly, allowing a friend to make mistakes is essential for their personal growth and development. Life is a series of experiences, and the lessons gained from errors often lead to greater wisdom. For instance, consider a friend who is adamant about pursuing a risky investment without heeding your advice. If you intervene and prevent them from acting on their decision, they may harbor resentment for feeling controlled, and they miss the opportunity to learn the consequences of poor choices firsthand. On the other hand, if you step back and let them navigate the consequences, they may emerge more knowledgeable and cautious in future decisions. This process of trial and error is crucial as it builds resilience and insight.Secondly, many friendships are built on trust and respect. If a person feels that their friend does not trust them to make their own decisions, it could lead to feelings of resentment and distance in the relationship. Taking a step back conveys respect for their autonomy, suggesting that you believe in their ability to make sound choices. For example, in a situation where a friend is pursuing a relationship with someone you deem unsuitable, addressing this directly might cause an argument, potentially jeopardizing the friendship. By allowing your friend to explore this relationship, even if it leads to disappointment, you preserve the foundation of mutual respect while still being available to offer support when needed.In conclusion, while intervening to prevent a mistake may seem protective, it can inadvertently damage the relationship. By letting a friend make their own choices, you foster personal growth and demonstrate trust in their judgment, ultimately strengthening the bond of your friendship.
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;One of the most effective ways for parents to prepare their teenage children for adult life is by encouraging them to take on part-time jobs. In my opinion, this experience offers invaluable lessons that transcend simple employment.Firstly, working part-time allows teenagers to earn their own money, fostering a sense of independence and financial literacy. Unlike receiving pocket money from their parents, earning a wage requires effort and commitment. This financial independence helps them understand the value of money and encourages them to budget effectively, which is a crucial skill in adult life. Moreover, part-time jobs instill a sense of responsibility and discipline in young individuals. For instance, if a teenager is frequently late for work, they may face consequences such as reduced pay or even termination. These potential outcomes teach them the importance of punctuality, reliability, and the need to abide by workplace rules. Such experiences are essential for their professional growth, as they learn to prioritize their commitments and manage their time efficiently.Additionally, part-time work enhances critical soft skills, including communication and teamwork. In the workplace, teenagers interact with diverse individuals, helping them develop interpersonal skills that are vital in both personal and professional contexts. They learn how to work as part of a team, resolve conflicts, and adapt to different work cultures, all of which are crucial for their future careers.In conclusion, encouraging teenagers to pursue part-time jobs is one of the best ways parents can prepare them for adulthood. Through gaining financial independence, learning responsibility, and developing essential soft skills, teenagers can build a strong foundation that equips them for the challenges of adult life.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;The debate over whether children should grow up in the countryside or a big city is multifaceted, and while both environments offer unique advantages, I firmly believe that urban living presents more opportunities for children. One of the most compelling reasons to raise children in a city is the diversity of experiences and cultural richness. Cities are melting pots of different cultures, languages, and lifestyles, exposing children to a wide variety of perspectives and encouraging inclusiveness. Children growing up in cities have access to museums, theaters, concerts, and a multitude of recreational activities, promoting artistic expression and a rich social life. This exposure enhances their understanding of the world and cultivates open-mindedness.Conversely, life in the countryside can often be restrictive. Although the natural environment may seem idyllic, it can also come with limitations. Opportunities for educational and social development are often confined, with fewer extracurricular activities and networking possibilities. In many rural areas, the pressure to excel academically to gain admission into a prestigious university can be overwhelming, as educational resources may be scarce. This emphasis on testing can detract from a child's overall learning experience.Moreover, the pervasive nature of gossip in smaller communities can create an oppressive atmosphere. Children in the countryside may feel stifled by the constant scrutiny of neighbors, which can limit their self-expression and independence. These dynamics can cultivate a sense of anxiety and discomfort that urban children may manage to avoid with the larger, more anonymous population of a city.In conclusion, while the countryside has its charms and benefits, I firmly believe that a city offers a more enriching environment for children. If I have children one day, I am confident that I will raise them in a vibrant urban setting, where they can benefit from diverse experiences, ample opportunities for growth, and the freedom to explore their identities without the restrictions often found in rural life.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;"The statement that parents are the best teachers resonates with many, and I wholeheartedly agree. Parents play an instrumental role in shaping their children's values, behaviors, and attitudes, making them some of the most influential figures in a child's life. One of the most compelling reasons for this viewpoint lies in the profound impact of parental words and actions. Children often view their parents as their primary role models, and the things they say carry great weight. For instance, a child's perception of self-worth is significantly shaped by their parents' praise or criticism. Words of encouragement from a parent have the power to bolster a child's confidence and inspire them to strive for their goals, often more effectively than the opinions of their friends or teachers.Moreover, children typically spend more time with their parents than with anyone else. This extended time creates numerous opportunities for learning and development. Through everyday interactions, parents can impart invaluable life lessons, from basic skills like cooking and problem-solving to more complex concepts such as empathy and responsibility. The continuous exposure allows for ongoing teaching moments, reinforcing the lessons learned over time.Additionally, children tend to mirror their parents' behaviors and attitudes. When parents demonstrate qualities such as kindness, resilience, and integrity, children are likely to adopt these traits themselves. For example, a child who witnesses their parents handle stress with grace is more equipped to manage their own challenges. This imitation process is vital, as it ensures that the foundational lessons taught by parents are internalized and manifested in their children's actions.In conclusion, the teaching that occurs within the family unit is unparalleled in its effectiveness and depth. Parents, with their influential words, extensive time with their children, and their ability to model behavior, undeniably emerge as the best teachers in a child's life. Their lessons are not confined to academic knowledge; they encompass the essence of being human, making them irreplaceable in a child's education."
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;"In today's fast-paced world, advancements in food preparation have notably transformed the way people live. The convenience of modern cooking techniques and ready-to-eat meals has made it easier for individuals to prepare delicious food, thereby enhancing their daily lives. However, this progress comes with a caveat; while many industrial foods taste better and are more accessible than ever, it is crucial for consumers to remain vigilant about their choices.The evolution of food preparation methods—such as microwaving, pre-packaged meals, and meal kits—has drastically reduced the time and effort required for cooking. Busy lifestyles often leave little room for elaborate meal preparation, and the ease of these options allows people to enjoy a variety of dishes without dedicating hours in the kitchen. For instance, a person can now whip up a gourmet meal with minimal time investment by using a meal kit that provides all the necessary ingredients and instructions. Furthermore, advancements in flavor enhancement and food technology have led to better-tasting options that appeal to diverse palates.However, the surge in convenience foods is accompanied by the growing concern over the health implications of processed and industrial meals. Many of these foods are laden with preservatives, unhealthy fats, and excessive sugars, which can lead to detrimental health outcomes if consumed regularly. It is essential for individuals to read labels and be discerning about their food choices, prioritizing nutritionally balanced options over artificially enhanced flavors.In conclusion, while the ease of food preparation has undoubtedly improved the quality of life for many, it is imperative that consumers approach food choices with care. Embracing the convenience of modern cooking should not come at the expense of health, and a balanced approach is key to enjoying the benefits of both accessible and nutritious meals."
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The debate surrounding the necessity of regular standardized tests in educational institutions is multifaceted. Advocates argue that standardized tests serve as vital tools for measuring students' academic progress and understanding, hence proving that they are indeed learning. One of the primary advantages of standardized testing is the ability it offers teachers to fairly and objectively assess their students' performance. Unlike subjective assignments or class participation, standardized tests provide a uniform criterion that ensures every student is evaluated under the same conditions.Furthermore, in an era of increasingly rigorous educational standards, many teachers find themselves relying heavily on exam results when grading students. This dependency stems from the need for consistency in the evaluation process and ensuring that all students meet the established learning goals. When teachers use standardized assessments, they can benchmark students’ knowledge against a broader population, allowing for clearer insights into where each student stands academically. This national standardization makes it easier for educators to identify learning gaps and adjust instruction methods accordingly, tailoring their approaches to better meet the needs of all students.Additionally, standardized tests can provide critical data for school-wide assessments, informing administration on curriculum effectiveness and helping to allocate resources where they are most needed. However, critics often argue that an overemphasis on standardized testing may lead to a narrow teaching focus, where educators prioritize test preparation over a more holistic approach to learning. Despite this concern, the overarching benefits of standardized assessments—such as consistency, objective grading, and comprehensive data—argue in favor of their necessity in schools. In conclusion, regular standardized tests should be a requirement for students as they not only validate learning outcomes but also support teachers in refining their instructional practices.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";In today’s world, the cost of education has escalated to unprecedented levels, making it increasingly difficult for potential students to pursue higher education. Many individuals find themselves applying for self-financed education due to the exorbitant tuition fees, which can lead to significant financial burdens and debt upon graduation. In this context, I strongly agree with the statement that a university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars.The rising costs of higher education present significant barriers to aspiring students, particularly those from low- to middle-income families. As a result, many talented individuals are unable to access quality education, which in turn perpetuates cycles of poverty and inequality. By providing free university education, society would enable a broader range of students to pursue their academic ambitions without the insurmountable stress of financial constraints. This inclusivity would not only enhance individual prospects but also foster a more educated workforce, ultimately benefiting the economy.Moreover, the idea of free education serves as a powerful motivator for scholars who are genuinely passionate about their fields of study. When students are not burdened by financial worries, they can devote their time and energy to academic pursuits and personal development. This encourages a culture of learning driven by curiosity and ambition, rather than by the financial return on investment.Furthermore, when universities are free of charge, they become more accessible to diverse populations, including marginalized groups who have historically faced barriers to higher education. This inclusivity leads to a richer mix of perspectives, ideas, and innovations, preparing students better for a globalized world.In conclusion, providing free university education to interested scholars not only addresses the current financial disparities in accessing education but also promotes a more equitable and innovative society. Making education free allows students to pursue their passions and contributes to a more informed and capable populace that is better equipped to tackle the challenges of the future.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;The role of university professors has been a subject of extensive debate, particularly when it comes to the balance between research and teaching. While it is undeniable that professors are fundamentally educators, a compelling argument can be made for them to allocate more time towards research for several key reasons.Firstly, research is crucial for the advancement of knowledge. Professors engaged in research contribute significantly to their respective fields, pushing the boundaries of understanding and innovation. When professors undertake research, they generate new ideas and discoveries that can enhance the educational content provided to students. By being at the forefront of their disciplines, they can infuse their teaching with the latest developments, offering students a more robust and relevant educational experience.Secondly, research often culminates in publications, which can enhance the reputation of the university. A university’s standing in the academic community is frequently measured by the research output of its faculty. A strong research profile can attract not only more funding but also high-caliber students and faculty, enriching the academic environment. Thus, when professors dedicate time to research, they contribute to building a prestigious institution that benefits all students.Moreover, engaging in research allows professors to mentor students in meaningful ways. Research projects can become platforms for student involvement, allowing them to gain hands-on experience that complements their classroom learning. Through such collaborations, students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills essential for their future careers.In conclusion, while teaching is a primary responsibility for university professors, the importance of research cannot be overlooked. The integration of research into the academic experience enriches both the educational atmosphere and the overall development of students. Therefore, professors should ideally balance their time, prioritizing research to foster an environment of continual learning and advancement.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;There is no doubt that television and movies influence people's behavior, shaping perceptions, attitudes, and actions. However, it is essential to recognize that, in general, these forms of media often sway us in negative ways more than positive ones. This influence manifests in various aspects of our lives, leading to unhealthy habits, reduced interpersonal interactions, and an inclination to adopt unrealistic personas.Firstly, one of the most significant ways television and movies affect behavior is through their portrayal of food and lifestyle choices. Numerous characters in popular films and shows are depicted indulging in junk food as a normative behavior, leading viewers to mimic such habits. For instance, the fast-paced lifestyle presented in shows often glorifies the consumption of unhealthy snacks, encouraging audiences to opt for convenience over nutrition. As a result, individuals may find themselves consuming more processed and high-calorie foods, which contributes to a rise in obesity and health-related issues.Moreover, the time devoted to watching television or movies can detract from valuable personal interactions. Instead of spending evenings with family or friends, many choose to binge-watch series or immerse themselves in films. This trend diminishes the quality and quantity of direct social interaction, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection from loved ones. For example, families that sit in front of screens instead of engaging in shared activities may find their relationships weaken over time due to a lack of meaningful conversation and quality time spent together.Lastly, media can promote the adoption of personas that are not true to oneself. Characters often embody exaggerated traits or lifestyles that viewers may feel pressured to emulate in real life. For example, the depiction of glamorous lifestyles in movies may lead individuals to pursue unrealistic standards of beauty or success. This pressure can diminish self-esteem and authenticity, as individuals struggle to align their identities with the sensationalized portrayals they see on screen.In conclusion, while television and movies have the potential to inspire positive change or promote awareness, the predominant influence tends to skew negative. The promotion of unhealthy eating habits, a decline in interpersonal relationships, and the pressure to conform to unrealistic stereotypes are just a few ways that these media forms can hinder authentic and healthy behavior. Recognizing these influences empowers individuals to make more conscious choices in their consumption of media, fostering healthier lifestyles and relationships.
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;Museums serve as vital portals to understanding the history and culture of the places we visit, making them appealing destinations for travelers. The numerous benefits of visiting museums can be categorized into their educational value and opportunities for social interaction, both of which enhance the travel experience.First and foremost, museums provide a treasure trove of information about a region's history, art, and cultural heritage. Each exhibit tells a story that reflects the unique identity of a location, allowing visitors to dive deeper into the narratives that shape it. For instance, a history museum may showcase artifacts from ancient civilizations, granting insights into their societal structures, beliefs, and daily lives. Such experiences foster a greater appreciation and understanding of the local culture, enriching a traveler’s experience far beyond the superficial sights of a city.Moreover, museums offer social opportunities that can lead to meaningful interactions. Visitors often find themselves in shared spaces, engaging with exhibits and discussing their interpretations with friends or fellow travelers. These discussions can extend to strangers, fostering connections that might not occur in more traditional tourist settings. For example, sharing thoughts on a particular painting in an art museum can lead to conversations about personal backgrounds, related interests, and diverse perspectives. These interactions can forge friendships founded on mutual interests in history, art, or culture, adding another layer to the travel experience.In conclusion, museums are invaluable assets for travelers seeking to deepen their understanding of a new locale. They provide extensive information about the history and culture of the area, while also presenting opportunities for social engagement that can lead to lasting relationships. Both educational and interactive, visits to museums are essential components of any meaningful travel itinerary.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"In a busy and crowded world, one might argue that we should not expect people to be polite to others, given the overwhelming pace of modern life. However, I firmly disagree with this notion. Politeness is not merely a social nicety; it is a reflection of one’s virtues and character. A man’s manner acts as a mirror, revealing the depths of his values and ethics. When individuals treat others with kindness and respect, they embody the very principles that contribute to a harmonious society.Politeness serves as a bridge that connects people from diverse backgrounds, creating a sense of community in our fast-paced environment. A person with good manners leaves a lasting positive impression on those they encounter, fostering goodwill and open communication. In a world where many feel rushed and overlooked, a simple act of courtesy can brighten someone's day. Whether it is offering a warm greeting or expressing gratitude, these gestures reflect an understanding of human dignity and the importance of interpersonal relationships.Additionally, kind words and polite behavior do not only benefit the receiver; they also enhance the speaker's reputation. Individuals known for their respectful demeanor are often regarded as trustworthy and approachable, which can lead to meaningful relationships both personally and professionally. Furthermore, such gestures can provide encouragement to those who may be struggling with their own challenges. Words of kindness can uplift the weary and instill hope in those who are in need.In conclusion, expecting politeness in an ever-busy world is not only reasonable but essential. Good manners exemplify one's virtues, foster positive impressions, and create a ripple effect of encouragement and support. In striving for civility, we enrich our lives and contribute to a more compassionate society."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;of the challenges that life presents, allowing them to respond with greater resilience. Some people advocate that the hardships faced during our formative years can lay a foundation for future success. I firmly agree with this perspective, as tough experiences often serve as invaluable lessons that guide us throughout our lives. For instance, when individuals struggle with personal or academic challenges in their youth, they often develop an appreciation for the simpler joys of life. The struggle can create a heightened sense of gratitude for achievements that may seem mundane to others. This newfound appreciation fosters both humility and contentment, essential traits that enrich one’s perspective in adulthood.Additionally, people who have navigated significant challenges tend to cultivate a sense of calm in the face of adversity. Past experiences of overcoming difficulties equip them with the necessary tools to tackle new problems. For instance, a student who has failed an important exam learns to cope with disappointment and adapt their study strategies. When faced with future setbacks, such individuals are more likely to remain composed, allowing them to devise practical solutions instead of succumbing to stress or despair.Moreover, these experiences often forge a sense of empathy and understanding towards others undergoing similar trials. When one has faced personal adversity, they are inclined to extend support and kindness to others in need. This heightened awareness can foster stronger relationships and a sense of community, ultimately contributing to both personal satisfaction and social harmony.In conclusion, the trials we endure during difficult times can undoubtedly transform into valuable lessons for the future. They teach us to cherish life’s small joys, develop resilience, and foster empathy, all of which play crucial roles in personal growth and success. Thus, I wholeheartedly embrace the belief that our toughest experiences shape us for the better in our life journeys.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;The debate over whether life in a city is superior to life in the countryside has been ongoing, with valid points on both sides. However, I argue that life in a city offers distinct advantages that make it a more appealing choice for many.Primarily, urban areas provide a much better education system. Cities often host renowned universities, a variety of colleges, and diverse academic programs that draw students from around the world. This abundance of educational resources equips individuals with the skills necessary to thrive in today's competitive job market. Furthermore, cities are bustling with job opportunities across various industries, from technology to finance and arts. This economic vitality provides residents with greater chances for career advancement and personal growth compared to the often limited job prospects in the countryside.Moreover, cities are melting pots of culture and diversity. The higher population density in urban areas results in a rich tapestry of cultural influences, where different communities coalesce. This cultural diversity enhances social interactions, broadens perspectives, and fosters understanding among people from various backgrounds. It leads to vibrant art scenes, diverse culinary experiences, and numerous festivals that celebrate the uniqueness of different cultures, which are often less prevalent in rural settings.In addition, public transport systems in cities are generally more efficient, with frequent buses and trains that enhance connectivity and make commuting easier. This convenience allows residents to navigate their daily lives with greater ease, reducing the reliance on personal vehicles and promoting a more sustainable lifestyle. However, it is essential to acknowledge the charms of countryside living, particularly the spaciousness and tranquility it offers. The lush landscapes provide ample opportunities for relaxation and recreation, which can lead to a fulfilling lifestyle. In conclusion, while the countryside holds its allure, particularly for those seeking peace and nature, the opportunities for education, work, cultural enrichment, and convenience in the city make urban life significantly better for many. The dynamic environment of a city not only fosters personal and career growth but also creates a rich community tapestry that contributes to a vibrant social life.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;In contemporary society, a growing number of individuals experience increased wealth and material prosperity. As people accumulate resources, they begin to prioritize their mental and emotional well-being, seeking happiness in various aspects of their lives. While I acknowledge that a fulfilling job can significantly contribute to one’s happiness, I argue that living environment plays a more crucial role for the majority.Firstly, the living environment encompasses a host of factors that directly influence our mood and overall sense of well-being. This includes not only the physical setting in which we dwell—such as urban versus rural living—but also essential community aspects, like safety, accessibility to nature, and quality of social relationships. A peaceful, supportive environment fosters a sense of belonging and security, which are essential components of happiness. In contrast, a stressful or toxic environment can lead to feelings of anxiety and dissatisfaction, regardless of one’s job satisfaction.Moreover, while a satisfying job can indeed provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, it is often the living environment that sustains a person’s happiness in the long term. People spend a significant amount of their time outside of work, and if they dwell in a supportive, vibrant community, this foundational aspect of life can enhance their overall experience. Additionally, a harmonious living environment encourages social connections, hobbies, and relaxation, which are vital for mental health.In conclusion, while jobs can certainly contribute to personal happiness, I believe that the living environment holds greater significance for most individuals. As we navigate through increasingly prosperous times, we must not overlook the profound impact that our surroundings have on our emotional well-being. A nurturing environment, rich in support and serenity, is indispensable for cultivating lasting happiness.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;In today's fast-paced world, communication is increasingly reliant on technology. Various methods such as e-mail, voice mail, telephone conversations, and traditional face-to-face interactions offer individuals multiple ways to connect. Among these options, I personally prefer email for three main reasons: convenience, honest expression, and fluency in communicating.Firstly, the convenience of e-mail cannot be overstated. In our busy lives, having the ability to send and receive messages at any time allows for flexibility that traditional communication lacks. I can check my emails during breaks at work or late at night, without the pressure of needing an immediate response. This asynchronous nature of email enables me to manage my time more effectively, allowing for better organization of thoughts and messages before hitting 'send.' Unlike face-to-face conversations, where immediate responses are expected, e-mail provides the breathing room needed to draft thoughtful replies.Secondly, e-mail affords a level of honest expression that can sometimes be challenging in real-time conversations. The written word allows me to articulate my thoughts clearly, choosing my words carefully and structuring my arguments in a way that feels most effective. This focus encourages honesty, as there is no pressure of reacting instantly to questions or comments. I can take a moment to reflect and express myself without the anxiety of face-to-face interaction.Lastly, e-mail promotes fluency in communication. With the ability to edit and revise, I can ensure my messages are coherent and well-structured. This is particularly beneficial for complex topics that may involve intricate details. In contrast, in-person conversations can lead to misunderstandings due to the immediacy of verbal exchanges.In conclusion, while various methods of communication have their advantages, I find that email strikes the best balance between convenience, honest expression, and fluency. Our evolving reliance on technology only enhances the effectiveness of this medium, making it my preferred choice for communication in today's world.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";Television has undoubtedly changed the way we communicate, often leading to a decline in meaningful interactions among friends and family. While it can serve as a source of entertainment and information, I agree with the statement that television has primarily destroyed communication among loved ones. One of the most significant negative effects of television is its ability to draw people into a world of distraction, resulting in reduced face-to-face conversations. Families often find themselves gathered in the same room yet completely absorbed in their screens. Instead of engaging in meaningful discussions about their day or sharing experiences, family members can spend hours glued to their favorite shows. This virtual separation can create barriers that hinder the emotional connections and understanding necessary for strong relationships. Moreover, television shows tend to shift attention away from what is genuinely important in life. Characters and plotlines often become so engrossing that viewers prioritize them over real-life interactions. For instance, a parent may choose to binge-watch a series rather than participate in their child's activities or support their family in everyday tasks. This shift in priorities not only diminishes valuable family time but can also lead to feelings of neglect and isolation among loved ones, as they may feel overshadowed by the allure of fictional stories. Additionally, the tendency for viewers to become obsessed with their favorite programs exacerbates the issue. When a show is on air, it can monopolize viewers' time and attention, leaving little room for social interaction. People may prioritize tuning in over attending family gatherings or organizing outings with friends. In conclusion, while television can entertain and inform, its detrimental effects on communication among friends and family cannot be overlooked. By prioritizing screen time over personal connections, television cultivates a culture of isolation rather than one of meaningful engagement, detracting from the essence of human relationships.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;In our fast-paced world, communication has evolved into various forms, with some individuals preferring methods such as telephone calls or face-to-face interactions, while others gravitate towards emails or voice mails. Personally, I believe that communicating via emails or voice mails is far superior for several reasons.Firstly, ease of use plays a significant role in this preference. Many individuals experience anxiety or hesitation when speaking on the phone, especially with people they are not well acquainted with. In such situations, leaving a voice mail or sending an email can be a far less daunting task. This allows for more considered communication, as one has the time to draft a message thoughtfully rather than being put on the spot in a phone call.Secondly, the flexibility offered by emails is unparalleled. One can compose an email at any hour of the day, enabling communication across different time zones without the constraints of scheduling a phone call. For instance, when working late or considering the recipient’s busy schedule, sending a well-crafted email can ensure that the message is conveyed aptly without the expectation of an immediate response. In contrast, telephone calls typically require both parties to be available simultaneously, which can often be a significant barrier to effective communication.Finally, written communication also allows for a clear record of messages exchanged. Emails can be archived and referenced later, providing a paper trail that is useful in both personal and professional contexts. This transparency can help avoid misunderstandings that often arise from verbal conversations.In conclusion, while many people still appreciate the immediacy of telephone calls and face-to-face interactions, I firmly advocate for the power of emails and voice mails due to their ease of use, flexibility, and the ability to maintain a clear record of communication. These advantages make digital communication a more appealing option in our contemporary lives.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;"The phrase ""haste makes waste"" captures a profound truth about the dangers of rushing into decisions without careful consideration. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, as haste often leads to outcomes that could have been avoided with a more thoughtful approach.When we make quick decisions, we risk overlooking critical details that might significantly impact the outcome. For instance, consider a student who hastily chooses a college major based on peer pressure or fleeting interests, without thoroughly evaluating their passions and career prospects. Such a rushed decision can lead to dissatisfaction and wasted time, resources, and potential career opportunities. If they had taken the time to reflect on their interests and aspirations, they might have found a field that truly resonates with them, ultimately setting them on a more fulfilling path.Additionally, hurried decisions can lead to negative repercussions that affect not only the individual involved but also their surrounding community. For example, in the business world, a manager who makes impulsive hiring decisions may overlook essential qualifications of a candidate, leading to poor performance and team dysfunction. This waste of human resources can stall projects, decrease morale, and incur financial losses, creating a ripple effect on the entire organization.Moreover, the implications of a hasty decision can extend into an individual's personal life. A rushed relationship decision, such as moving in with a partner too quickly, can result in unforeseen setbacks and emotional stress. These outcomes reiterate that making hasty choices often leads to wasted time and effort in mitigating the problems that arise from those decisions.In conclusion, ""haste makes waste"" serves as a valuable reminder that taking our time to reflect on decisions yields better results. By prioritizing thoughtfulness and patience, we can make more informed choices that lead to positive outcomes and ultimately enrich our lives rather than detract from them."
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;"The automobile has undeniably transformed modern life, serving as one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday scenarios. Its widespread use is evident; millions of people own cars, using them daily to commute to work, run errands, and travel for leisure. This level of integration into daily routines highlights the automobile's importance in enhancing mobility and convenience in contemporary society.One of the most compelling advantages of the automobile is its ability to facilitate travel. Unlike earlier modes of transport that limited movement to specific routes or schedules, cars offer unparalleled flexibility. Individuals can travel whenever they choose, enabling spontaneous adventures and the opportunity to explore both local and distant destinations. This freedom to travel encourages cultural exchange and enhances our understanding of the world beyond our immediate surroundings, fostering a sense of global community.However, it is crucial to acknowledge the problems that accompany widespread automobile use. The environmental impact, particularly in terms of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, presents serious challenges. Cities worldwide grapple with traffic congestion, leading to longer travel times and increased stress for commuters. Furthermore, the reliance on automobiles can contribute to sedentary lifestyles, which are linked to various health issues. Despite these drawbacks, I believe that the benefits of the automobile outweigh its challenges. With evolving technology and a growing focus on sustainability, the automotive industry is moving toward solutions that address most of these issues, such as electric vehicles and improved public transportation systems. Ultimately, the automobile has enriched our lives, providing unparalleled convenience and access to the world. Embracing its advantages while addressing its negative impacts can lead to a more balanced relationship with this essential mode of transportation."
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;The question of whether children should pursue careers similar to their parents' jobs or explore vastly different paths has sparked much debate. I argue that it is better for children to follow in their parents' professional footsteps, as the familiarity and support provided can significantly benefit their career development.Choosing a job that aligns with one's parents' profession can present a unique advantage. Parents often possess valuable domain knowledge and industry-related information that they can impart to their children. Growing up in a household where a particular career is discussed can expose children to the nuances of the field from a young age. This early exposure allows children to develop a clearer understanding of the skills and requirements necessary to succeed in that profession. Moreover, parents can serve as mentors, guiding their children through the complexities of job applications, interviews, and networking, boosting their confidence and competence in the process.Although some argue that the job market is constantly evolving and that the unique conditions of the current economy necessitate a departure from traditional career paths, I believe that the foundational support of experienced parents can still create smoother transitions into the workforce. In fact, navigating the challenges of a new industry can be daunting, and having a parent in the same field can provide insights into breaking into the market and understanding emerging trends.In conclusion, while there are merits to pursuing diverse career paths, the advantages of aligning one's career with that of their parents cannot be overlooked. The guidance and knowledge that parents can offer contribute to a stronger foundation for children's professional journeys, ultimately leading them to more successful and fulfilling careers.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;The debate surrounding the high salaries of professional athletes and entertainers is a contentious one. While it is undeniable that these individuals earn staggering amounts of money—salaries that can be hard to fathom for the average worker—one must consider the factors that justify such compensation. Despite the disparity between the earnings of athletes and those in more traditional careers, I believe there are valid reasons to support the high salaries that professional athletes command.Firstly, an individual's salary often reflects their competence and ability to generate revenue. Professional athletes operate in a highly competitive field where only a select few achieve the pinnacle of success. Their skills, dedication, and commitment to their craft are unparalleled, and they often put in years of grueling training and preparation to reach the elite level. Unlike many professions, the careers of athletes are often short-lived, sometimes lasting just a few years. Consequently, their lucrative contracts can be seen as a way to compensate for the limited time they have to earn a living in their chosen sport.Moreover, the high salaries awarded to professional athletes not only reward their talent but also support their exceptional performances. Athletes are the linchpins of a multi-billion-dollar industry that includes ticket sales, sponsorship deals, and broadcasting rights. These athletes bring entertainment to millions, creating a profound impact on fans and communities worldwide. Their performances inspire loyalty and connection, generating revenue that far exceeds their salaries. Thus, compensating them well ensures they can focus on their performance without the added stress of financial instability.In conclusion, while the income gap between professional athletes and the average worker may seem disproportionate, it is essential to recognize the unique circumstances surrounding their careers. They deserve their high salaries not only because of their talent and the economic benefits they provide but also because they set the standards for excellence in their fields.
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;The question of whether young children, aged 5-10, should be required to learn music and art alongside core subjects such as math, science, history, and language is a topic of considerable importance. Many parents instinctively include music and art in their must-learn list, recognizing the multifaceted benefits these disciplines provide. In my opinion, introducing children to music and art at a young age is not only suitable, but essential for their overall development.Engaging in music and art fosters sensory development in children. These disciplines encourage creativity, imagination, and self-expression. While math and science stimulate logical thinking and analytical skills, music and art open up a world of sensory experiences that can enhance emotional intelligence. Children learn to interpret sounds, colors, and forms, which helps them develop a well-rounded perspective of the world around them. This sensory engagement lays the groundwork for innovative and critical thinking skills that they will carry throughout their lives.Moreover, music and art are worthwhile investments in a child's lifelong cultivation. Learning to play an instrument, for instance, instills discipline and perseverance. Similarly, creating art encourages patience and attention to detail. These attributes are not only valuable in artistic pursuits but are also applicable in academic and professional environments. The skills acquired through these creative avenues can lead to improved focus and better performance in other subjects.Lastly, exposure to music and art can nourish a child's temperament. Engaging in creative activities often serves as an emotional outlet, helping children navigate their feelings and develop resilience. The joy and fulfillment derived from creating art or making music can positively impact their self-esteem and interpersonal relationships.In conclusion, requiring children to learn music and art in addition to traditional subjects is a holistic approach to education. It ignites creativity, enriches emotional development, and cultivates life skills that are instrumental in their journey through life. As we guide our children through their formative years, let us not overlook the immeasurable benefits of nurturing their artistic and musical talents.
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;In my opinion, the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside of school. When students can see the real-world relevance of what they are learning, they are more likely to engage deeply with the material. This connection fosters a love for learning that extends beyond the classroom walls.For example, in a mathematics class, when a teacher demonstrates how statistical concepts can be used to analyze sports scores, make financial decisions, or assess risks in daily life, students are more likely to appreciate the value of math. Similarly, when science teachers explain concepts like ecosystems or human anatomy in relation to health and environmental issues, students can better understand their significance. This linkage not only piques interest but also encourages students to actively participate, ask questions, and seek further knowledge. Moreover, when students grasp how their education can influence their future, they develop a sense of purpose and motivation. They begin to appreciate that knowledge is not just about passing exams, but about equipping themselves with the skills necessary for success in their personal and professional lives. This understanding transforms their learning experience from a mere obligation to an exciting journey of discovery.Additionally, the ability to relate academic subjects to real-life scenarios aids in skill retention. When students can recall a lesson by associating it with a real-life application, such as budgeting for a personal project or understanding health-related content in the news, the information becomes more memorable. Thus, by emphasizing how subjects connect to the students' everyday lives, teachers can enhance engagement and make learning a meaningful pursuit. Through this approach, education transcends traditional boundaries, preparing students not just for tests, but for life itself.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;"In the 21st century, the balance between environmental protection and economic development stands as one of the most pressing issues faced by governments worldwide. Both domains are crucial, as the health of our planet directly impacts human welfare and the future of economic growth. However, I firmly believe that prioritizing environmental protection in government budgets is essential for sustainable progress.The urgency of environmental issues cannot be overstated. Climate change, pollution, deforestation, and biodiversity loss threaten not only the natural world but also human communities. The consequences of neglecting these problems are stark: rising sea levels, extreme weather patterns, and health crises related to environmental degradation could lead to humanitarian disasters. In this context, investing in environmental protection is imperative to ensure that ecosystems remain intact, which in turn supports agriculture, clean air and water, and overall public health. On the other hand, economic development, while essential, should not come at the expense of the environment. Traditional economic growth often involves resource exploitation and pollution, leading to long-term detrimental effects that can undermine future economic stability. For instance, a thriving economy that depletes natural resources and fosters ecological harm may find itself facing significant challenges when those resources are exhausted or climate-related disasters hinder productivity. Thus, sustainable economic models that restructure how society values resources can only evolve through a foundation of environmental stewardship.Therefore, government budgets should reflect a commitment to prioritizing environmental protection. By allocating funds to clean energy initiatives, conservation projects, and sustainable infrastructure, governments can cultivate an economy that not only thrives but does so within the Earth’s ecological limits. Investing in our planet is an investment in humanity’s future; it ensures that economic development is viable and reaps benefits for generations to come. Ultimately, embracing environmental protection as a first priority paves the way for a sustainable, equitable, and prosperous future."
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;The debate regarding the future of car usage encompasses various arguments, each with valid points. While some argue that personal cars are essential for daily life, I agree with the perspective that in twenty years, there will likely be fewer cars in use than today. Several factors, including environmental concerns, advancements in technology, and shifts in urban planning, support this prediction.Firstly, the rise in environmental awareness has significantly influenced public attitudes towards car ownership. As concerns about climate change and air pollution grow, more people are seeking sustainable transportation alternatives. Government initiatives, such as promoting electric vehicles (EVs) and enhancing public transport systems, are pivotal in this shift. For instance, cities are increasingly investing in bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, reducing the reliance on cars.Secondly, technological advancements are transforming transportation. The development of autonomous vehicles and ridesharing services offers convenience and cost-effectiveness that may make car ownership less appealing. With apps like Uber and Lyft becoming ubiquitous, people now have easy access to transportation without the financial and logistical burdens of owning a car. Moreover, as autonomous vehicles become more prevalent, it is likely that car sharing will become a norm, further decreasing the need for individual ownership.Lastly, urban planning trends also suggest a future with fewer cars. Many cities are working towards becoming more walkable, with mixed-use developments that allow residents to live, work, and access services without the need for a vehicle. This encourages a lifestyle shift that prioritizes public transport and non-motorized means of travel.In conclusion, while personal cars currently play a significant role in daily life, various factors indicate a decline in their usage over the next two decades. With growing environmental advocacy, evolving technologies, and supportive urban policies, it is reasonable to expect that the number of cars on the road will decrease, marking a substantial shift in our transportation landscape.
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;"The debate surrounding the necessity of class attendance for university students is a multifaceted issue. While some argue that as long as students can pass their examinations, class attendance is not essential, I firmly disagree. There are several compelling reasons why attending classes plays a crucial role in the educational experience.Firstly, university education is designed to be an independent learning environment that grants students the flexibility to explore knowledge on their own terms. However, this independence does not equate to the irrelevance of classroom instruction. Attending classes provides students with structured learning opportunities, access to expert insights, and a cohort of peers for collaboration. These elements foster a deeper understanding of the material that solitary study often lacks.Moreover, learning is proven to be more effective in a classroom setting than studying alone. Classes encourage active participation, immediate feedback, and discussion, all of which enhance retention and comprehension. Simply focusing on examinations can lead to a superficial understanding of the subject matter, whereas engaging in classroom activities promotes critical thinking and the ability to apply knowledge in practical situations.In addition to learning benefits, attending classes embodies a basic responsibility of university students. Enrolling in a course comes with the expectation of participation, and students have a commitment to their education and to their peers. By attending classes, students demonstrate respect for their educators and fellow students, fostering a positive learning community.In conclusion, while it is true that some students may succeed in examinations without attending classes, the overall benefits of participation far outweigh any potential convenience in studying alone. Class attendance is not merely about passing exams; it is about cultivating a well-rounded educational experience that prepares students for future challenges."
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;"The assertion that ""when people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success"" sparks a compelling debate about the factors contributing to achievement. While some individuals believe that luck plays a crucial role in the success of various prominent figures, I firmly disagree with this perspective. Instead, I contend that hard work and diligence are the true driving forces behind most success stories.To begin with, if we analyze the lives of renowned individuals, it becomes evident that their achievements stem from their relentless dedication and perseverance rather than sheer luck. Take, for instance, figures like Thomas Edison or J.K. Rowling. Both faced numerous challenges and failures but ultimately achieved great success through consistent effort and commitment to their goals. Edison's famous quote, ""Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration,"" encapsulates this belief. These individuals illustrate a powerful reality: hard work often outweighs the role of chance in determining success.Moreover, relying on luck alone is an exceedingly tenuous strategy. Luck can be unpredictable and fleeting, providing no guarantee of success. Individuals who pin their hopes on luck run the risk of stagnation, as they await favorable circumstances instead of actively pursuing their goals. In contrast, those who work diligently create opportunities for themselves, navigating challenges and adapting to circumstances over time. This proactive approach fosters resilience and equips them to capitalize on favorable moments when they arise.In conclusion, while luck may influence some aspects of success, it is ultimately hard work that leads to meaningful achievements. History is replete with examples of esteemed figures whose tenacity and effort propelled them to greatness. Thus, I maintain that success is a result of hard work, with luck playing a secondary role, if any, in the grand tapestry of accomplishment."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;The debate over whether learning is more effective when conducted independently or under the guidance of a teacher is a nuanced one, with valid arguments on both sides. Personally, I believe that while self-directed learning can be beneficial, having a teacher provides invaluable advantages that can significantly enhance the learning experience. One of the primary benefits of learning with a teacher is that it helps to prevent confusion. Teachers possess a depth of knowledge, and their experience allows them to clarify complex concepts that might otherwise be misinterpreted when studied alone. For example, in subjects like mathematics or science, a teacher can provide real-time explanations, answer questions, and guide students through challenging problems. This immediate feedback and clarification can reduce misunderstandings and ultimately foster a more comprehensive understanding of the material.Moreover, a skilled teacher can dramatically increase the rate and speed of learning. With structured lessons and a clear curriculum, teachers can introduce topics in a logical order, aiding cognitive development. They can also inspire motivation through engaging and interactive teaching methods, which can lead to higher retention rates. For instance, when learning a new language, a teacher can facilitate conversation practice, helping students to quickly acquire speaking skills that might take weeks to develop alone.On the other hand, there are times when I prefer the autonomy that comes with self-directed learning. Independent study allows me to explore subjects at my own pace and delve into topics that particularly interest me. It fosters critical thinking and self-discipline, as I must manage my own time and resources to achieve my learning goals.In conclusion, while self-directed learning has its merits, the guidance of a good teacher undeniably accelerates the learning process and enhances understanding. A balanced approach, utilizing both methods, often yields the best educational outcomes.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;The debate over the efficiency and productivity of working from home compared to office work has gained significant traction, especially following the rise of remote work technologies. While the flexibility that comes with working from home is appealing, I firmly believe that working in a company’s office presents distinct advantages that contribute to a more efficient and collaborative work experience.Firstly, the office environment fosters a sense of community and teamwork that is difficult to replicate at home. When colleagues are physically present, they can easily engage in discussions, brainstorm ideas, or collaborate on projects in real-time. This immediacy often leads to a more dynamic exchange of ideas, making it easier to resolve issues and innovate. In contrast, while individuals can work anywhere with just a computer and phone, the absence of face-to-face interaction can create a disconnect among team members, potentially stifling creativity and synergy.Moreover, working in an office ensures that employees remain updated on important events and announcements. Critical information, such as directives from management or changes in company policy, is often communicated more effectively in person. Those who work from home may inadvertently miss out on these discussions or fail to capture the nuances of important conversations that can shape their understanding of the company’s goals and values. This lack of awareness can lead to feelings of isolation and hinder personal and professional growth within the organization.In conclusion, while the allure of working from home may seem attractive for its flexibility, the productivity and engagement that stems from working in an office setting cannot be overlooked. The collaborative spirit, opportunities for spontaneous discussions, and direct access to management highly contribute to a more efficient work environment. Therefore, I contend that working at a company’s office is superior to working from home, especially in fostering a productive and cohesive workplace culture.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;"In today’s competitive landscape, the debate surrounding the need for individuality versus conformity is more relevant than ever. I firmly believe that being different from everyone else is essential for success, as it often signifies a higher level of achievement and fosters one’s unique value.When individuals dare to stand out, they often accomplish remarkable things that surpass the average. Differentiation is a powerful tool; it showcases not just brilliance, but the courage to innovate and challenge the status quo. Many revered trailblazers — from scientists to artists — have paved the way to greatness by embracing their unique perspectives rather than simply mirroring the norms of their peers. For instance, the tech giant Apple is an ideal representation of the benefits of uniqueness. Founded by Steve Jobs, who valued innovation over similarity, Apple revolutionized the technology industry through its distinctive products, design philosophy, and marketing strategies. Rather than conforming to existing paradigms, Apple set its own standards, creating an unassailable brand identity that stood apart from competitors.Moreover, being unique allows individuals to cultivate their own intrinsic value, forming a signature that is uniquely their own. This distinctiveness ensures that one's contributions cannot be easily replicated, leading to opportunities that would otherwise remain closed to those who conform. For instance, in a sea of generic job applicants, a candidate who showcases innovative thinking and a unique skill set is far more likely to attract the attention of employers and create lasting impact.In conclusion, I strongly contend that success is more closely linked to individuality than conformity. Embracing one’s differences not only leads to superior achievements but also fosters personal value that resists duplication. In a world that thrives on innovation, being different is the key to success."
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;The challenges faced by young people today are markedly different from those confronted by their parents and grandparents. While every generation encounters difficulties, the complexities of the modern landscape usher in a unique set of trials that stem primarily from globalization and the quest for self-identity.Firstly, the realm of work-related challenges has evolved significantly due to globalization and industrial integration. In contrast to previous generations, where career paths were often linear and well-defined, young people today navigate a marketplace characterized by rapid technological advancements and shifting economic paradigms. Industries are more interconnected and unstable, leading to increased competition and the necessity for individuals to adapt continuously to new skills and environments. For instance, the rise of the gig economy means that job security is less guaranteed, forcing young professionals to juggle multiple roles or freelance jobs—something their grandparents may have never envisaged. The need for lifelong learning in an information-heavy context creates both opportunities and a level of pressure that can be overwhelming.Secondly, contemporary youth face significant challenges related to self-recognition, which were less pronounced for prior generations. The pervasive influence of social media and the internet fosters an environment where young individuals constantly compare themselves to curated versions of others’ lives. This phenomenon can lead to identity crises and self-worth issues as they grapple with external expectations and societal pressures to succeed. The focus on individualism and personal branding—agents of change in self-perception—was not as prevalent in the upbringing of older generations, where community and tradition often defined identity.In conclusion, while challenges are a universal aspect of human experience, the specific struggles faced by young people today are not only distinct from those of their parents and grandparents but also reflect broader societal changes. The intricacies of a globalized economy and the quest for personal identity shape a landscape that demands resilience and adaptability, marking a profound shift from the past.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;"There are many viewpoints regarding the main characteristics of successful people, but one common thread among them is the willingness to step out of one’s comfort zone. In my opinion, successful individuals are characterized by their propensity to try new things and take risks rather than solely sticking to their areas of expertise. This approach fosters personal growth, innovation, and ultimately leads to success.One reason I support this statement is that when individuals venture into uncharted territories, they unlock opportunities to learn important and valuable lessons. For instance, an entrepreneur who decides to explore a new market or adopt new technology may initially face challenges. However, these experiences provide insights that can be leveraged for future ventures. Learning from failures, adapting strategies, and cultivating resilience are integral to personal and professional development. A prime example can be seen in Steve Jobs, who famously embraced new ideas and bold risks, continually pushing the boundaries of technology and design. Moreover, I firmly believe that great success requires taking great risks. The most impactful achievements often occur when individuals step beyond the familiar and push the limits of their capabilities. For instance, consider the world of scientific discovery; many breakthroughs, like the development of vaccines or sustainable energy solutions, arose from individuals daring to explore the unknown. Their willingness to experiment and confront failures created pathways for innovation and advancement.In conclusion, while there are various traits associated with successful individuals, the courage to try new things and embrace risks stands out as a defining characteristic. The valuable lessons gained from these experiences contribute to growth and the ability to navigate future challenges, reinforcing the notion that risk-taking is an essential ingredient for true success."
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;In today's competitive job market, the debate over whether the ability to relate well to people outweighs the importance of studying hard in school is a nuanced topic. While I believe that both elements are crucial for success in a future job, the capacity to connect with others cannot be overlooked. Studying hard in school lays the foundational knowledge and skills needed for a specific field. It equips individuals with the technical expertise essential for performing various tasks. However, knowledge alone does not guarantee success. In professional environments, the ability to relate well to people significantly enhances one's prospects. This skill fosters better teamwork, collaboration, and mutual understanding, which are vital in most careers.One key factor closely tied to the ability to relate to others is effective communication. When individuals can convey their thoughts, ideas, and emotions clearly, they create an atmosphere conducive to productive interactions. For instance, professionals who can understand and empathize with their colleagues and clients are more likely to forge strong relationships, which often leads to career advancement and new opportunities. A wide network of communication can also result from these relationships, giving professionals access to valuable resources, information, and support.Consider the example of an individual who has exceptional technical skills but struggles to communicate effectively with peers or superiors. This person might face challenges in collaborative projects, resulting in missed deadlines or misunderstandings. On the other hand, someone who may not have the strongest academic background but excels in interpersonal skills can thrive in team settings, gaining visibility and respect within the organization.In conclusion, both the ability to relate well to people and the commitment to studying hard are integral to achieving success in future careers. A balance between knowledge and interpersonal skills can foster a more dynamic work environment, ensuring that individuals not only perform their duties effectively but also build valuable connections along the way.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;In today's modern society, advertising plays an omnipresent role, influencing people's choices across a myriad of products and services, including food. With the advent of digital platforms, advertising has become more pervasive and persuasive than ever. However, I contend that while advertising contributes to unhealthy eating habits, it is not the main cause. Rather, the responsibility lies in individuals' understanding of nutrition and their ability to practice self-control.Firstly, it is essential to recognize that the foundation of a healthy eating pattern is rooted in the concept of wholesome diets. A diet that prioritizes whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, grains, and lean proteins is the ideal way to nourish the body. If individuals are educated about these nutritional principles, they are better equipped to make informed choices, regardless of advertising tactics.Additionally, self-control plays a pivotal role in the establishment of healthy eating habits. People frequently encounter advertising for unhealthy food options, but they maintain the ability to choose healthier alternatives. The decision ultimately rests with the consumer. Teaching children and adults about moderation and responsible eating can effectively mitigate the influence of advertising on dietary choices.Moreover, it is worth noting that advertising can also promote healthier eating habits. With an increasing emphasis on wellness, many campaigns are now focused on promoting balanced diets and active lifestyles. These advertisements can raise awareness and inspire individuals to adopt healthier behaviors rather than indulging in unhealthy options.In conclusion, while advertising has an undeniable impact on consumer behavior, it is not the primary culprit behind unhealthy eating habits. A comprehensive understanding of nutrition, combined with self-discipline, emerges as the true solution. By fostering these elements within the framework of modern society, individuals can resist the negative influences of advertising and establish a healthier relationship with food.
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";The assertion that television has destroyed communication among friends and family is a contentious one, and I find myself inclined to disagree with it—in part. While television undoubtedly serves as a powerful tool for learning, entertainment, and keeping people informed about current events, it is important to recognize that it can also contribute to negative behaviors that may hinder interpersonal communication among individuals.Television offers a vast array of information and entertainment options, making it an invaluable resource for learning. Documentaries and educational programs can broaden our knowledge of diverse topics, while news broadcasts help us stay updated on global happenings. Furthermore, television often serves as a topic of conversation among friends and family, providing opportunities to bond over shared interests in particular shows or events. For example, discussing the latest episode of a popular series can spark lively discussions and strengthen social ties.However, it is crucial to acknowledge the detrimental effects that excessive television watching can have on communication. Many individuals find themselves spending hours in front of a screen, often at the expense of quality time with loved ones. This is particularly evident during family meals, where some members might opt to watch television rather than engage in conversation. Eating in front of the television may foster a culture of disengagement, substituting meaningful interactions with passive consumption of content. As a result, some relationships may suffer from a lack of genuine connection and shared experiences. In conclusion, while television can facilitate learning and serve as a source of entertainment, its excessive consumption can negatively impact communication among friends and family. It is essential for individuals to strike a balance, prioritizing face-to-face interactions over screen time to cultivate deeper and more meaningful relationships.
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;The role of sports and social activities in universities and colleges is often debated alongside the academic programs that define higher education. While I acknowledge the importance of physical health and social interaction in the lives of students, I do not agree that these activities deserve equal financial support as academic initiatives such as libraries and laboratories.University students can largely be divided into two groups: those who are less interested in their studies and often engage more in extracurricular activities, and the diligent students who prioritize their academic pursuits. While sports and social activities can serve as a valuable outlet for relaxation and stress relief, they may also distract some students from their primary focus—education. For this reason, it is imperative that funding is directed primarily towards academic resources that foster learning and innovation.Moreover, engaging in physical exercise for at least 30 minutes daily is indeed essential for a healthy, balanced life. It contributes to physical well-being, mental health, and social connectivity. However, the foundation of a university experience lies in academic growth and intellectual exploration. The libraries and laboratories are essential for providing students with the tools they need to succeed, engage in research, and develop critical thinking skills.In conclusion, while sports and social activities play a significant role in enhancing the student experience and fostering overall well-being, they should not receive equal financial support compared to academic resources. Prioritizing investment in libraries and laboratories ensures that students are equipped with necessary knowledge and skills for their future careers. Balancing academics with sports and social activities is important, but it must be clear that academic pursuits should remain the predominant focus of financial support in higher education.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;"Attending classes has always been a pivotal aspect of the university experience, and I firmly believe that university students should be required to attend classes. This approach presents numerous benefits that foster a productive learning environment and equip students with vital skills necessary for their academic and future professional success.Firstly, being physically present in class creates opportunities for direct communication and interaction with peers and instructors. This interaction is invaluable; students can engage in discussions, collaborate on projects, and share insights that enhance their understanding of complex materials. For instance, when students have the chance to discuss new concepts with classmates, they can revisit these ideas in their free time, reinforcing their learning through group study sessions and informal discussions. This collaborative approach often leads to a deeper comprehension of the subject matter than solitary study.Moreover, attending classes allows students to seek immediate assistance in grasping difficult topics. In a classroom setting, students can ask questions in real time and receive instant feedback from professors or teaching assistants. This immediacy helps clarify misunderstandings and deepens learning, while independent study lacks this level of support. Many students find solace in knowing they have access to experienced educators who can guide them through challenging coursework.Furthermore, attending classes instills discipline, accountability, and time management skills. Students learn to prioritize their commitments and maintain a routine, all of which are essential skills in both academic and professional settings. By being present in class, they are more likely to invest their time effectively, leading to higher academic performance and fostering a responsible work ethic.In conclusion, while some may argue that class attendance should be optional, the benefits of mandatory attendance—such as improved collaboration, enhanced understanding of material, and the development of critical life skills—argue convincingly in favor of requiring university students to attend classes. The university experience is not solely about acquiring knowledge; it is also about growing as a member of a community, and attendance is a crucial part of that growth."
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;I agree with the statement that telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. However, I believe that they have greatly enhanced the convenience and efficiency of our interactions. In my own life, these tools have made communication far easier, allowing me to connect with others regardless of geographical distance.Firstly, telephones and email enable me to reach out directly to the individuals I want to communicate with. Whether it’s a quick phone call to a friend or an email to a colleague, I can establish a connection swiftly and without the constraints of time or location. For instance, I can send an email to a classmate to discuss a project at any hour, ensuring that communication flows without the limitations that a face-to-face meeting might impose. This immediacy is vital in today’s fast-paced world, where time is often at a premium.Secondly, I find that I can express my thoughts and feelings more clearly in writing than I can in a face-to-face conversation. When I communicate via email, I have the opportunity to organize my thoughts, choose my words carefully, and even edit my message before sending it. This is particularly useful when discussing complex or sensitive topics, as it allows me to convey my intentions more accurately and thoughtfully. For example, when conveying constructive feedback to a peer, writing an email allows me to articulate my points in a clear and respectful manner, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings that could arise in a verbal exchange.In conclusion, while telephones and email may reduce the personal touch of communication, they undoubtedly make our interactions easier and more efficient. By allowing direct access and providing a platform for clear expression, these tools enhance our ability to connect with others meaningfully in an increasingly busy world.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;"When considering the choice between living in a small town or a big city, I firmly believe that the vibrant atmosphere of a big city offers more advantages, particularly in terms of social experiences and access to advanced healthcare.One of the most compelling reasons to live in a big city is the abundance of social venues. In metropolitan areas, one can find a plethora of restaurants that cater to diverse culinary tastes, from gourmet dining to local street food. Big cities often boast numerous museums, art galleries, and theaters, providing endless opportunities for cultural enrichment. Whether it’s watching the latest blockbuster in a state-of-the-art cinema or catching a live performance at a renowned theater, city life is teeming with exciting options. Small towns, in contrast, typically offer limited choices; often there is just one bar or a single cinema, making it difficult for residents to socialize or enjoy varied entertainment.Furthermore, the healthcare facilities available in big cities are second to none. Advanced medical technologies and specialized healthcare professionals are more readily available, ensuring better health outcomes for residents. This is particularly important in emergency situations, where timely access to first-rate medical care can make a significant difference. While some might argue that urban environments can be overwhelming or impersonal, I believe that the benefits of superior healthcare and the richness of social options outweigh any potential downsides. Ultimately, while small towns may appeal to those seeking tranquility and a close-knit community, I find the dynamic lifestyle of big cities, characterized by diverse social experiences and top-notch healthcare, far more enticing. The breadth of opportunities available makes city living not just preferable, but truly enriching."
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;The debate between sticking to what one does well versus venturing into new territories is a compelling one. Personally, I prefer to try new things and take risks, even if I am not inherently good at them. This inclination stems from my belief that exploring uncharted waters can foster creativity, personal growth, and a diverse skill set.When I venture outside my comfort zone, I often stumble upon hidden talents and interests that I might not have discovered otherwise. For instance, during my high school years, I decided to join a pottery class, despite having no prior experience in art-related activities. Initially, I struggled with shaping the clay, but as I persisted, I not only honed my skills but also developed a newfound passion for ceramics. This experience taught me that stepping outside of my established competencies can lead to gratifying and unexpected avenues of personal expression.However, I also recognize the merit in focusing on my strengths. Concentrating on what I do well, such as writing and public speaking, allows me to attain specific goals more efficiently. The more time I invest in honing these skills, the closer I come to achieving significant milestones, whether it's publishing an article or delivering a compelling presentation. Achieving greatness often requires dedication and mastery, and regular practice in areas of proficiency lays a robust foundation.In conclusion, while there’s undeniable value in nurturing one’s existing abilities, my preference for trying new things and embracing risks enriches my life in ways that remaining stagnant cannot. The contrast between the two approaches highlights the balance that can be achieved: venturing into new experiences enlarges one’s horizons, while focusing on established strengths allows for significant accomplishments. Embracing both can ultimately lead to a fulfilling and successful life.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;The debate surrounding whether children should learn financial responsibility at a young age or wait until adulthood is one that evokes diverse opinions. Many argue that children should be shielded from financial complexities until they are fully matured, yet I firmly believe that instilling money management skills early has significant advantages.First and foremost, teaching children to manage their own money fosters a sense of independence that is crucial for their personal development. When children are entrusted with their allowances or small amounts of money, they learn to make choices, prioritize needs over wants, and experience the consequences of their decisions. This hands-on experience cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are invaluable as they mature.Moreover, acquiring financial knowledge early can lead to better habits that last a lifetime. By learning to budget, save, and invest while they are young, children are more likely to carry these skills into adulthood. It reduces the risk of falling into debt or making poor financial choices later in life. For instance, understanding the significance of saving for emergencies or planning for future expenses can empower them to make informed decisions as they navigate greater financial responsibilities.Additionally, exposing children to financial management can demystify money, transforming it from a source of anxiety into a manageable tool. Through discussions about earning, spending, and saving, parents can foster realistic attitudes toward money, helping children develop a healthy relationship with their finances.In conclusion, I believe that teaching children to manage their own money at a young age is vital for their development into financially responsible adults. The skills they acquire early in life will equip them with the knowledge and confidence needed to navigate the complexities of adult financial obligations, ultimately leading to a more secure and stable future.
275;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Dancing plays an important role in a culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;In every country, people do dance for fun, for entertrain, and for decrease a stress. Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture. For instance, I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom, king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture. The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.;Dancing undeniably plays a significant role in every culture around the world. I fully agree with the statement that it is an essential aspect of cultural expression and human experience. Firstly, dancing is a universal activity that transcends geographical boundaries. In each country, people engage in dance for various reasons, be it for fun, entertainment, or stress relief. For example, in Brazil, samba is not only a vibrant dance form but also a social activity that brings communities together during Carnival. The joy and energy of such events help reduce stress and foster a sense of belonging among participants.Moreover, dancing is deeply embedded in the beliefs and traditions of many cultures. Traditional dances often tell stories or commemorate significant historical events. For instance, the Hula dance of Hawaii encapsulates the islands' history, spirituality, and connection to nature, allowing practitioners to convey deep cultural narratives. Through dance, individuals express their beliefs and honor their heritage, making it a vital part of cultural identity.Additionally, the evolution of dance styles can showcase the civilization of a culture. As societies change and grow, so too do their dance forms. The emergence of hip-hop in the United States during the late 20th century is a prime example. This genre not only reflects the struggles and triumphs of urban youth but also embodies the innovation and creativity of contemporary American culture. By exploring different dance forms, we gain insight into the values, challenges, and aspirations of people within that society.In conclusion, dancing serves multiple purposes, from promoting joy and alleviating stress to encapsulating tradition and history. It stands as a testament to the creativity and resilience of cultures worldwide, reinforcing the perspective that it plays an essential role in shaping and defining cultural identity. Therefore, I strongly believe that dancing is vital to cultural heritage and social cohesion.
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential for students than learning facts. However, I am convinced that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students’ future lives.Firstly, when students focus on learning facts in school, they become better equipped to face real-life problems. Knowledge of essential facts—such as historical dates, scientific principles, and mathematical formulas—provides a solid foundation that can be applied to various situations. For example, understanding the facts surrounding climate change can empower students to engage in informed discussions and drive change, while having a firm grasp on basic financial literacy can help them manage their finances effectively in adulthood. These facts work as tools that enable students to analyze situations critically and make informed decisions, ultimately preparing them for the complexities of life.Secondly, learning facts contributes significantly to students’ social behavior. A well-informed individual can engage in meaningful conversations, appreciate cultural differences, and contribute to societal discourse effectively. For instance, a student with solid historical knowledge can discuss past events and their impact on contemporary society, fostering connections with peers who share diverse backgrounds. Knowledgeable students are often seen as confident leaders who can navigate social interactions with poise, paving the way for fruitful collaborations in both their personal and professional lives.While understanding ideas and concepts is undeniably important, it is the mastery of facts that serves as the bedrock of education. Facts ground students in reality and equip them with the essential tools needed to thrive in an ever-evolving world. Consequently, prioritizing factual learning in education not only lays a strong foundation for academic success but also enhances students’ capabilities to navigate life's challenges effectively.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;The question of whether sports and social activities at universities and colleges should receive equal financial support as classes and libraries is an ongoing debate. In my opinion, I firmly believe that sports and social activities play a crucial role in the overall development and well-being of students and therefore deserve equal financial backing.First and foremost, sports have significant effects on students' health. In an age where sedentary lifestyles are common, engaging in physical activities is essential for maintaining good health and preventing lifestyle-related diseases. Regular participation in sports contributes to students’ fitness, helping them maintain a healthy body shape and promoting physical endurance. Moreover, participating in sports can significantly boost students’ energy levels, ensuring they are more alert and focused during their studies. Therefore, financial support for sports programs can directly correlate with improved health outcomes for students.Additionally, social activities are integral to the university experience. They foster a sense of community and belonging, which is particularly important for students who may be away from home for the first time. These activities expose students to diverse perspectives and encourage them to collaborate and understand the thoughts and emotions of others. Such interpersonal experiences can enhance empathy and social skills, which are essential in both personal and professional realms. Furthermore, social activities provide students with opportunities for fun and entertainment, helping alleviate the stress that can accompany academic responsibilities.In conclusion, while classes and libraries are undeniably important for academic achievement, sports and social activities are equally essential for the holistic growth and health of students. They promote physical well-being, facilitate emotional development, and contribute to a more enriching university experience. Therefore, I advocate that sports and social activities should receive equal financial support to ensure a balanced and comprehensive educational environment.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;The internet is widely regarded as one of the most important inventions of the past century, revolutionizing the way we access and share information. While some argue that the plethora of information available online is a valuable resource, I align with the perspective that this overwhelming abundance can create significant problems.One of the main issues stemming from the vast amount of information available on the internet is the challenge of distinguishing credible sources from unreliable ones. For instance, anyone can publish content online, leading to the dissemination of misinformation and biased narratives. This has become particularly problematic in areas such as health and politics, where a single false claim can have dire consequences. The prevalence of “fake news” undermines informed decision-making and perpetuates confusion among the general public.Moreover, easy access to vast amounts of information can lead to information overload. Individuals may find themselves inundated with data and opinions, making it difficult to discern what is truly important or relevant. This overwhelming influx can result in anxiety, as people struggle to keep up with the constant stream of news and updates, which may detract from their ability to engage deeply with more significant issues.Contrastingly, proponents of the internet argue that it enhances knowledge and awareness, allowing people to explore the world and gain valuable insights. While this is valid, the accompanying problems of misinformation and information overload cannot be overlooked. In my opinion, these challenges significantly outweigh the benefits. Navigating the online landscape requires critical thinking skills that not everyone possesses, which creates a widening gap in understanding and knowledge.In conclusion, while the internet is undoubtedly a powerful tool for information dissemination, the problems associated with its misuse and the overwhelming amount of data available can hinder rather than help. As we continue to embrace this technology, it is essential to cultivate digital literacy and discerning judgment to navigate the complexities of the information age effectively.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;In the contemporary landscape of higher education, universities play a crucial role in equipping students with the knowledge and skills necessary for navigating real-life challenges. While some institutions advocate for a curriculum focused solely on specialization, I contend that universities encouraging students to study a variety of subjects offer a more comprehensive and beneficial educational experience.Firstly, studying a diverse array of subjects enables students to explore their interests more thoroughly. Many young individuals enter university with only a vague idea of what they want to pursue. By exposing them to multiple disciplines, schools allow students the opportunity to discover passions that they may have not considered before. For instance, a student initially focused on engineering might develop an interest in philosophy or environmental studies, leading to a more fulfilling career path rich in interdisciplinary collaboration.Moreover, acquiring knowledge from various fields fosters a well-rounded education. Today's job market often demands adaptability and a holistic understanding of a range of concepts. Individuals equipped with skills in multiple disciplines are not only more versatile but are also better prepared to tackle complex problems. For instance, a graduate with a background in both economics and environmental science will be able to engage with pressing issues like sustainable development more effectively than someone who has only mastered one discipline.Finally, a diverse educational background increases career opportunities. In a rapidly changing job market, having a versatile skill set opens up numerous paths. Students who can draw on knowledge from different areas are often more appealing to employers who value adaptability and innovative thinking.In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, the benefits of studying multiple subjects are significant. It nurtures personal interests, promotes a well-rounded education, and broadens career prospects. Therefore, I argue that universities that encourage an interdisciplinary approach better prepare students for their future.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;In my opinion, governments should prioritize spending on basic needs for people rather than allocating significant funds to explore outer space. While the exploration of outer space captures our imagination and offers potential scientific advancements, it is vital to address the pressing challenges we face on Earth first.The primary concern for any government should be the welfare of its citizens. Basic needs such as jobs, a clean environment, and strong family units are crucial for societal stability. Firstly, employment opportunities must be created for individuals to provide for themselves and their families. Unemployment leads to a myriad of issues, including poverty, crime, and mental health problems. Governments should invest in job creation and skills training programs to ensure that every citizen has access to meaningful work.Secondly, a good environment is essential for the health and well-being of the population. Climate change and environmental degradation pose significant threats to our ecosystem and, consequently, to human life. Governments should channel funds into renewable energy projects, pollution control, and conservation efforts to protect our planet for future generations. Investing in a sustainable environment not only improves quality of life but also fosters economic opportunities through green jobs.Lastly, family structures are the foundation of society. Governments should support initiatives that promote family stability, such as affordable healthcare, education, and family counseling. Programs that assist families in need ensure a stronger social fabric and contribute to overall community well-being.In conclusion, while the allure of outer space exploration is undeniable, the immediate needs of people on Earth must come first. Prioritizing jobs, a good environment, and family support lays a strong foundation for a society that can thrive and perhaps one day, if resources allow, embark on the journey to explore the cosmos.
281;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples in your answer. ;Nowadays, we are living in in the world which is absolutely complicated. Everything seem to be rush, and it have a lot of competition. These make people get stress. Thus, many people try to reduce their stress. There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress. in my opinion, reducing stress by listening to music, playing sports, and doing meditation are easy and practical ways.First of all, listening to music is a great way to relax. For example, when I go to office, I use public transport. I see many things such as traffic jam, crowded people at bus stop, and all so crowded people in buses. These make me stress. So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me. Consequently, I feel happy when I listen music.Second, another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise. For instance, I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time. These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress. Thus, after work, I always do exercise, and jogging is my favorite sport. I feel that after working out, I am easily to fall asleep. Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health.Third, meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress. when I have many things to think about, and this make me stress, I will do meditation. Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment, and it take few minutes. A way to do meditation is that I just sit down, close my eyes, and count my breath. These could relieve me from stress. In conclusion, there are many ways to reduce the stress. In my point of view, listening to music, exercising, and doing meditation are the most activities that people could do to escape from stress. It is are easy and usable. And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind.;In today's fast-paced world, stress has become an inevitable part of life for many. However, there are various effective strategies to reduce stress and improve overall well-being. In my opinion, three of the best ways to escape from stress are listening to music, playing sports, and engaging in meditation. Each of these activities offers unique benefits that can help individuals find solace amid the chaos of modern life.Listening to music is one of the simplest yet most powerful methods to alleviate stress. Studies have shown that music can lower cortisol levels, the hormone associated with stress. Whether it’s classical music that promotes relaxation or upbeat tunes that lift the spirits, music has the ability to transport individuals away from their worries. For instance, after a long day at work, many people find comfort in their favorite playlists, allowing the melodies to soothe their mind and rejuvenate their spirit.Engaging in physical activity, such as playing sports, is another effective strategy for stress relief. Exercise stimulates the production of endorphins, chemicals in the brain that act as natural mood lifters. Playing sports, whether it's soccer, basketball, or even a casual game of volleyball, not only provides a great outlet for pent-up energy but also creates opportunities for social interaction and camaraderie, further enhancing emotional well-being. For example, joining a local sports team can foster friendships and provide a sense of community, which alleviates feelings of isolation often linked to stress.Finally, meditation serves as a practical tool for reducing stress by promoting mindfulness and present moment awareness. When individuals engage in meditation, they develop the ability to observe their thoughts without judgment, allowing them to detach from sources of anxiety. Even just a few minutes of deep breathing or guided meditation can significantly impact one's mental health. For example, programs like mindfulness-based stress reduction have been shown to help people manage stress effectively, leading to improved focus and emotional balance.In conclusion, listening to music, playing sports, and practicing meditation are among the best activities for reducing stress. These avenues not only provide practical ways to escape modern-day challenges but also foster a healthier lifestyle, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling, balanced life.
282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;In the realm of education, the question of how teachers should be compensated is a topic of significant debate. I strongly disagree with the notion that teachers should be paid based on their students' learning outcomes. This perspective fails to consider several critical factors that influence the educational process.Firstly, the primary responsibility of teachers is to impart knowledge within a limited timeframe. In a typical school setting, educators navigate a diverse classroom comprising students with varying levels of comprehension and engagement. With the pressure of covering a prescribed curriculum, a teacher often finds it challenging to provide individualized attention to each student. Consequently, it becomes unreasonable to tie teachers' salaries to student performance, especially when they have a restricted window to deliver complex material effectively.Additionally, learning capabilities differ widely among students. Some students may excel in understanding new concepts quickly, while others may require more time and different approaches to grasp the same material. Evaluating a teacher’s effectiveness solely based on students' test scores overlooks the myriad factors—such as personal circumstances, learning disabilities, and even emotional support—that can significantly impact a student's ability to learn. For instance, a student with a supportive home environment might thrive academically, while another facing challenges at home may struggle, regardless of the teacher’s efforts.Finally, aligning teacher pay with student performance could inadvertently encourage a narrow focus on test results rather than fostering a rich, holistic educational experience. Teachers might prioritize exam strategies over critical thinking and creativity, undermining the overall quality of education. In conclusion, while teachers indeed play a crucial role in shaping their students’ knowledge, reducing their compensation to the observable learning outcomes of students is not only unjust but also counterproductive. Education is a collaborative endeavor—the responsibility of learning should be shared among students, teachers, and the broader educational system.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;The debate surrounding the morality reflected in movies and television is a significant one, particularly when it comes to the representation of good and bad characters. On one hand, it is common for films and television shows to conclude with the triumph of good over evil, thereby rewarding virtuous characters and punishing those with malicious intent. This formulaic approach often leads to satisfying resolutions and a sense of justice, as audiences hope to witness the rightful consequences for actions as prescribed by societal norms.However, while such narratives provide a sense of comfort and optimism, they can also create unrealistic expectations about life. The notion that good people always receive happy endings while bad people invariably face punishment does not accurately reflect reality. In the real world, many virtuous individuals often face hardships or unfortunate circumstances, and sometimes, malevolent individuals escape justice altogether. Consequently, presenting a singular view of morality can mislead young audiences, fostering a skewed understanding of how the world operates.It is crucial, especially for impressionable children, to be exposed to a more nuanced depiction of morality. Stories that illustrate the complexities of life—where good deeds do not always lead to favorable outcomes, and bad actions may go unpunished—can provide valuable lessons in resilience and the unpredictability of existence. As a society, we should encourage the creation of narratives that embrace these complexities rather than oversimplifying moral lessons. This not only prepares young viewers for the realities of life but also cultivates empathy, understanding, and a more balanced worldview. Ultimately, while it can be gratifying to see good rewarded and evil punished, it is important to acknowledge the shades of gray in human experience to foster a more holistic understanding of life.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;The advent of technology has revolutionized education, sparking a debate over the efficacy of distance learning compared to traditional classroom instruction. While it is undeniable that online computer classes offer various advantages, I fundamentally disagree with the assertion that they should completely replace conventional classroom learning. I will present several reasons to support my viewpoint.Firstly, distance learning provides unparalleled flexibility. Students can access materials at their own pace, enabling them to balance studies with personal commitments or work. However, this flexibility may lead to procrastination and a lack of discipline, often resulting in subpar learning outcomes. In contrast, traditional classrooms foster a structured environment where students are obligated to adhere to a timetable and engage directly with their peers and instructors.Secondly, online learning can sometimes lack the interactive element essential for effective education. The physical classroom allows for real-time discussions, collaboration, and immediate feedback, facilitating deeper understanding of complex concepts. Students thrive on social interaction, and the interpersonal skills developed through face-to-face communication cannot be replicated online. This lack of personal interaction in distance learning can lead to feelings of isolation and impede the development of critical soft skills.Furthermore, classroom learning often provides a more conducive environment for educational activities that require hands-on experiences, such as laboratory experiments or group projects. These in-person experiences enhance learning, making it more memorable and impactful. In conclusion, while distance learning and online courses present significant benefits, including accessibility and flexibility, they should not replace traditional classroom education. The importance of personal interaction, structure, and hands-on learning experiences in a classroom cannot be overstated. Thus, a hybrid approach that incorporates both methods could be the most effective way forward, combining the strengths of online and face-to-face learning.
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;"Throughout my life, a myriad of experiences has shaped my outlook and fundamentally altered the way I approach everyday living. One of the most significant turning points occurred during my time at university. This academic journey provided a fertile ground for personal growth and mental resilience. The challenging environment and the rigorous curriculum compelled me to develop a more prudent mindset when addressing problems. I learned to analyze situations carefully, weigh the pros and cons, and consider the consequences of my choices before taking action. This problem-solving approach has not only benefited my academic performance but has also equipped me with skills to navigate life's complexities more effectively.Moreover, my university experience fostered a sense of independence that was pivotal in teaching me self-care. Moving away from home and managing my studies, finances, and personal well-being on my own was a revelation. I learned the importance of maintaining a balanced lifestyle, incorporating healthy eating, regular exercise, and mental health breaks into my routine. These lessons about self-care were sometimes hard-earned; late-night study sessions often led to fatigue, prompting me to adopt healthier habits to sustain my energy levels and focus. Additionally, interactions with individuals from diverse backgrounds throughout my university years enriched my understanding of the world. Exposure to different perspectives taught me empathy and the value of listening. This has encouraged me to approach conflicts with an open mind and fostered a deeper appreciation for the richness of human experiences. In conclusion, my university experiences have been instrumental in shaping my outlook on problem-solving and self-care. They have instilled a more thoughtful and conscientious approach to both personal challenges and the world around me, which continues to guide my decisions and actions today."
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;In today's interconnected world, the ability to speak a foreign language has become more vital than ever. As globalization continues to shape our societies, many individuals pursue foreign language studies to enhance their career prospects and broaden their cultural horizons. There are two primary approaches to language learning: studying in one’s home country or immersing oneself in the country where the language is spoken. While both methods have their advantages, I believe that learning a foreign language in its native context proves to be the better choice.One primary advantage of learning a language in one's own country is accessibility. For many, local language classes are convenient and affordable, allowing a structured learning environment without the financial burden associated with studying abroad. Additionally, it offers the opportunity to learn with classmates, encouraging peer interaction and mutual support. However, this approach has its limitations, as it often lacks immersive experiences that can deepen language proficiency.On the other hand, studying a foreign language in its native country immerses learners in the language and culture, accelerating the learning process significantly. Immersion provides real-life practice, prompting learners to use the language in diverse contexts—be it ordering food, navigating public transport, or engaging in casual conversations with locals. This daily engagement reinforces vocabulary and pronunciation, making it easier to grasp language nuances. Furthermore, cultural exposure enriches the learning experience, allowing students to appreciate idioms, gestures, and societal norms that are essential for effective communication.In conclusion, while learning a foreign language in one's own country offers accessibility and a supportive environment, studying in the country where the language is spoken presents an invaluable opportunity for immersion and cultural understanding. Given the increasing significance of foreign language proficiency in our globalized world, the latter approach undoubtedly equips learners with the skills needed to thrive in diverse settings.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;If I could change one significant aspect of my hometown, it would undoubtedly be the transportation infrastructure. While my hometown boasts a variety of public utilities that cater to essential needs—such as water supply, electricity, and waste management—the public transportation system remains inadequate. A more comprehensive and efficient public transportation network would dramatically enhance the quality of life for all residents.One of the primary reasons for advocating this change is accessibility. A robust public transportation system allows individuals without personal vehicles, particularly the elderly, low-income families, and students, to navigate the city easily. Currently, many residents rely solely on cars, making it challenging for those who cannot afford one to access jobs, education, and essential services. For instance, a neighbor of mine, a single mother working multiple jobs, spends a significant portion of her paycheck on ride-sharing services simply to get her children to school and herself to work. This is both financially and mentally exhausting.Moreover, an improved public transportation system would help reduce traffic congestion, leading to a cleaner environment. On busy mornings, the roads are often clogged with single-occupancy vehicles, contributing to pollution and longer commute times. By expanding bus and train services, we could encourage more people to utilize public transport, significantly lessening the reliance on personal vehicles. Cities that have invested in public transportation—like New York, San Francisco, and Tokyo—have not only reduced traffic but also fostered a more community-oriented atmosphere, where individuals can interact and engage with one another.In conclusion, enhancing public transportation in my hometown would address key issues of accessibility and environmental sustainability. It would create a more inclusive community that accommodates the needs of all its residents, fostering a sense of unity and ultimately improving the overall quality of life.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;The notion that schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers is one that merits serious consideration. I firmly agree with this idea, as it is a valuable tool for enhancing the educational system. By gathering opinions from students, schools can foster an environment where continuous improvement is not only encouraged but essential.Firstly, student evaluations can significantly augment a teacher's performance. Teachers often operate in isolation, making self-assessment challenging. By providing constructive feedback, students can highlight areas where a teacher excels and identify aspects that may need adjustment. For instance, if students consistently express that a teacher’s explanations are unclear or that the pace of the class is too fast, it empowers the educator to refine their teaching methods accordingly. This feedback loop can lead to more effective instruction and ultimately enhance students’ comprehension and retention of the material.Moreover, when students evaluate their teachers, it contributes to the overall improvement of the educational system. Educational institutions are responsible for preparing students for future challenges, and understanding the effectiveness of teaching practices is essential in that endeavor. Through these evaluations, schools can identify trends and patterns across different subjects and classrooms. For example, if multiple evaluations reveal that certain teaching strategies are ineffective, schools can implement systemic changes, such as professional development programs, resource allocation, or curriculum adjustments, to ensure a higher quality of education for all students.In conclusion, soliciting evaluations from students is an essential strategy for improving both teacher performance and the broader educational system. By valuing student input, schools can create a dynamic learning environment that not only benefits teachers but also enhances the learning experiences of students. In an era where education must adapt to ever-evolving societal needs, student evaluations serve as a vital tool for fostering excellence in teaching and learning.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;In the ongoing debate over workplace preferences, the choice between large and small companies often sparks differing opinions. Personally, I gravitate towards the idea of working for a large company, and I have several compelling reasons for this preference.First and foremost, one of the significant advantages of large companies is the availability of job opportunities. Due to their extensive operations, they typically have various positions open across multiple departments, making it easier for candidates to find jobs that match their skills. This abundance of opportunities provides job security and a wider range of career options, which can be particularly appealing in today’s competitive job market.Additionally, large companies generally offer better salaries and more comprehensive benefits compared to their smaller counterparts. With greater financial resources at their disposal, larger organizations can provide incentives such as competitive wages, health insurance, retirement plans, and other perks that contribute to an employee’s overall well-being. This financial stability is crucial for employees aiming to support themselves and their families.Furthermore, one of my personal passions is travel, and large companies often operate on an international scale. This global presence can offer employees the chance to travel abroad for business meetings or projects, providing enriching experiences and cultural exposure that small companies may not be able to afford. The opportunity to connect with diverse communities and broaden one’s professional network is invaluable in today’s interconnected world.In conclusion, while small companies have their unique advantages, I strongly prefer the environment offered by large organizations. The increased availability of job opportunities, the potential for better salaries, and the chance to travel internationally align with my personal and professional aspirations, making the choice of a large company the most appealing option for me.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;"The debate over whether college or university education should be accessible to all students or reserved solely for those deemed ""good"" students is a pressing issue in today’s educational landscape. On one hand, proponents of exclusive access argue that higher education should focus on individuals who demonstrate academic excellence. They contend that limited resources should be allocated to those who have shown potential for success in rigorous academic environments, as these students are more likely to utilize their education effectively and contribute positively to society.Conversely, many believe that higher education should be made available to all individuals, regardless of their current academic standing. This perspective emphasizes the transformative power of education, asserting that colleges and universities play a significant role in equipping people with essential academic skills that are necessary to pursue their goals. By providing access to education for all, society fosters a diverse and inclusive environment that allows for varying perspectives and talents to flourish. Additionally, this approach can empower underprivileged students who may have faced significant obstacles in their educational journeys, enabling them to reach their full potential.Personally, I align with the view that higher education should be open to all students. Limiting access based on predetermined criteria risks perpetuating existing inequalities and hinders the growth of a well-rounded society. Education is not solely about grades; it is about personal growth, resilience, and the ability to contribute to one’s community. Allowing all students to pursue higher education creates opportunities for lifelong learning and personal development, ultimately enriching society as a whole. By embracing an inclusive educational model, we equip individuals with the tools they need to navigate the complexities of modern life, thereby fostering innovation and progress across various sectors."
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;"In today’s digital age, online computer games have captivated a significant number of students, leading to an alarming obsession that detracts from their academic performance. The temptation of immersive virtual worlds often results in distractions that divert attention away from studies, homework, and essential learning activities. Consequently, many students experience a decline in their grades and overall academic success, as they find it difficult to balance their gaming habits with educational responsibilities.Moreover, contrary to the belief that computer games can provide educational benefits, most of these games fail to offer any substantial learning experiences. Instead, they often serve as mere entertainment, occupying hours that could be more productively spent on academic pursuits. The time dedicated to gaming can be categorized as wasted, as it does not contribute positively to cognitive or personal development. You cannot gain knowledge or skills from playing these games; they provide no significant educational value.Additionally, the themes and content of many popular computer games are concerning. A large number of these games revolve around violence, war, and even sexual content, which can desensitize young players to real-world issues. By engaging with content that glorifies aggression and brutality, students risk developing unhealthy attitudes towards violence and conflict resolution. Such exposure raises ethical concerns about the influences these games have on impressionable minds, often leading to distorted perceptions of reality.For these reasons, it is crucial to consider limiting students’ access to computer games. By restricting this pastime, we can encourage them to invest their time in more fruitful activities that foster learning and personal growth. Ultimately, prioritizing education over gaming is essential for cultivating a generation that values knowledge, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence."
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;In today’s collaborative environment, the question of whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or through emails remains pertinent. While both methods have their merits, I argue that in-person collaboration is superior due to its ability to enhance the quality and efficiency of projects.Working in person allows team members to communicate openly and establish a rapport that is often impossible to replicate in digital communication. The interpersonal dynamics fostered in face-to-face interactions can significantly reduce misunderstandings and conflicts among team members. A study conducted by Beijing University supports this notion, indicating that teams are more likely to reach agreements swiftly when they engage in direct conversation rather than relying on emails. The speed of communication in person encourages a more fluid exchange of ideas and quick problem resolution, which is crucial when working against tight deadlines.Moreover, in-person meetings allow for non-verbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, which can enhance understanding and emotional connection. These elements contribute to a positive team atmosphere, helping to bolster collaboration and creativity. When individuals feel comfortable and connected, they are more likely to share their ideas openly, ultimately improving the overall quality of the project.While emails provide a necessary alternative, particularly in situations where in-person meetings are unfeasible, they can often lead to delays and miscommunications. Email exchanges can be cumbersome and may lack the immediacy required for effective teamwork. Nevertheless, in circumstances where remote work is the only option, emails serve their purpose as a vital communication tool. However, they should not replace the benefits derived from face-to-face collaboration.In conclusion, while both methods of working on projects have their pros and cons, in-person collaboration stands out as the more effective choice for enhancing project quality and efficiency. A more harmonious team dynamic, faster conflict resolution, and richer communication are essential to the success of any collaborative endeavor.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;The debate over whether university professors should prioritize research or teaching is a compelling one, especially in an age where scientific advancement is at the forefront of societal development. While some argue that increased commitment to research could compromise the quality of education, I firmly believe that professors should be encouraged to dedicate significant time to research, as it enriches the educational experience and fosters a culture of innovation.There is an observable trend in academia, where more and more university professors are becoming deeply involved in scientific research. This involvement often leads to the generation of cutting-edge knowledge and the production of groundbreaking studies that can significantly impact various fields. As such, professors who engage actively in research often bring their findings into the classroom, thereby enhancing the curriculum with contemporary insights. This direct correlation between research and teaching can inspire students, igniting their enthusiasm and potentially fostering a new generation of researchers and thinkers.Critics of this model worry that professors’ focus on research might detract from their responsibilities as educators, leading to a decline in the quality of teaching. However, my own experiences have shown me that professors who are engaged in research often become more passionate and dynamic educators. They are able to provide real-world examples and experiences, making the learning process more relatable and engaging. Furthermore, by involving students in research projects, professors can cultivate skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving, which are crucial for students’ future careers.In conclusion, while the concerns around the balance of research and teaching are valid, I believe that the benefits of professors’ involvement in research far outweigh the potential drawbacks. Encouraging professors to engage in research not only elevates the quality of education but also prepares students to excel in an ever-evolving world.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;The debate over whether learning is more effective in a solitary environment or within a structured classroom setting has been a topic of discussion among students and educators for years. Personally, I strongly prefer learning with a teacher rather than learning by myself, and I believe this preference significantly impacts my educational experience.One of the primary reasons I favor learning with a teacher is the immediate feedback they provide. In a classroom setting, when I encounter a challenging concept, I can seek clarification and guidance right away. This instant support not only helps me grasp new material more effectively but also fosters a deeper understanding of the subject. When I study alone, I often find myself grappling with confusion and uncertainty, which can lead to frustration and a lack of motivation.Furthermore, learning alongside a teacher allows for the development of essential skills that are vital in today's collaborative world. For individuals who rely solely on self-directed learning, there is a risk of stunting their ability to cooperate with others and articulate their thoughts. In a classroom environment, discussions and group activities encourage students to express their opinions and engage with their peers. This interaction promotes critical thinking and enhances communication skills, both of which are crucial for success in any field.Additionally, teachers often introduce a variety of learning methods and perspectives that self-study might not offer. Through lectures, demonstrations, and interactive activities, teachers create a dynamic learning atmosphere that helps to maintain engagement and interest. A diverse approach to learning can inspire creativity and provide students with a well-rounded educational experience.Ultimately, while self-learning can be beneficial in certain contexts, I believe that learning with a teacher provides a more comprehensive and enriching experience. The guidance, feedback, and collaborative skills gained from structured learning are invaluable and contribute significantly to my academic growth.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;"Technology is frequently heralded as a transformative force, reshaping modern life and empowering individuals in ways previously thought impossible. Many people believe they are fortunate to be living in an era marked by rapid technological advancement. However, when closely examined, it becomes clear that these innovations often complicate our lives more than they simplify them.One of the primary reasons technology complicates our lives is the incessant need for connectivity. While social media platforms and instant messaging applications are designed to keep us in touch with friends and loved ones, they can lead to an overwhelming sense of obligation. The bombardment of notifications can create anxiety, as individuals feel pressured to respond immediately, resulting in a virtual bond that can feel more like a burden. Furthermore, the lines between personal and professional lives have blurred; it's not uncommon for employees to find themselves answering work emails late into the night, detracting from personal time.Additionally, the rise of smart devices has led to an increase in dependence on technology for even the simplest tasks. While voice-activated assistants make it easy to set reminders or control home appliances, they can also create confusion and frustration. Misunderstandings in voice recognition can lead to repeated commands and wasted time, eliminating the very simplicity that these tools were meant to provide. Furthermore, the complexity of managing multiple devices and platforms can become exhausting, requiring users to continually adapt to new updates and features.In conclusion, while technology undoubtedly has the potential to enhance our lives, it often brings with it a plethora of complications. The constant connectivity and reliance on multiple devices may contribute to stress and frustration, inviting us to reconsider whether progress is indeed making our daily lives simpler. Instead, it may be time to evaluate our relationship with technology and strive for a more balanced approach that prioritizes ease over complexity."
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";In recent years, distance-learning programs have gained immense popularity, providing flexible educational opportunities for millions. However, there remains a strong debate regarding their efficacy compared to traditional, in-person education offered by colleges and universities. I firmly believe that classroom learning is superior to online classes for several compelling reasons.Firstly, classroom learning instills a sense of discipline and time management in students. When attending a physical school, students are required to complete their study assignments and projects within specified timelines. This necessity cultivates essential time management skills, as learners must juggle various commitments, assignments, and deadlines effectively. In contrast, the flexibility of online classes can lead to procrastination and a lack of urgency, making it easy for students to fall behind without strict deadlines.Moreover, the role of professors in a classroom setting cannot be overstated. In-person lectures provide students with immediate access to invaluable insight, guidance, and real-time interaction with experienced educators. Professors can tailor their teaching methods to the dynamics of the classroom, encouraging lively discussions, answering questions on the spot, and fostering a deeper understanding of complex subjects. This interactive atmosphere is often absent in online courses, where communication is limited to scheduled discussions or written correspondence, potentially diminishing the overall learning experience.Additionally, learning in a classroom promotes social interaction and collaboration among peers. These interactions are crucial for developing interpersonal skills and creating networking opportunities that can be beneficial in future careers. In an online setting, students may feel isolated, leading to a less enriching educational experience.In conclusion, while distance-learning programs offer flexibility and accessibility, I strongly advocate for the superiority of classroom learning. The discipline it instills, the vital role of professors, and the interactive environment fostered within physical classrooms collectively create an unparalleled educational experience that online classes cannot replicate.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";"In various countries, it is common for teenagers to engage in part-time jobs while still enrolled in school. This practice, while met with some opposition, offers numerous benefits that can significantly contribute to a young person's development. I firmly believe that working as a student can enhance essential life skills and provide financial assistance to families.Critics of teenagers working often argue that part-time jobs can distract students from their academic responsibilities, leading to poor grades and burnout. However, I contend that balancing work and study is an excellent opportunity for teenagers to cultivate valuable skills. One of the primary advantages is the development of time management abilities. Students must learn to juggle their academic duties with job responsibilities, which fosters discipline and organization. This balance can result in improved productivity and a greater appreciation for their education.Moreover, working provides teenagers with a firsthand understanding of money management. Earning their own income teaches them the importance of budgeting and saving, valuable lessons that will serve them throughout their lives. By handling their finances, they develop a sense of responsibility and independence, which prepares them for adulthood.Additionally, part-time jobs often require teenagers to communicate effectively with customers and colleagues, enhancing their interpersonal skills. These experiences teach them how to persuade and negotiate, skills that are essential in any career path. Finally, the impact of part-time work extends beyond the individual; it can also be financially beneficial for families. Many teenagers contribute a portion of their earnings to household expenses, alleviating some financial burdens on their parents.In conclusion, while there are arguments against teenagers holding jobs while studying, the advantages far outweigh the drawbacks. The experiences gained from part-time work foster invaluable skills in time and money management, communication, and responsibility, benefiting both the students and their families."
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;In an increasingly globalized world, the ability to communicate in a foreign language has become essential. As individuals engage with people from diverse backgrounds—be it in business, travel, or cultural exchanges—learning at least one foreign language is often a necessary skill. There are two primary methods of acquiring these languages: studying in one’s own country or immersing oneself in a foreign environment. While both approaches have their merits, I believe that learning a foreign language in one's own country provides distinct advantages that outweigh the benefits of immersion.One primary advantage of learning a foreign language domestically is accessibility. Many language schools offer structured programs tailored to various proficiency levels, allowing learners to progress at their own pace. This setting provides a supportive environment where instructors can address students' specific needs and challenges. Furthermore, learners can access resources, such as textbooks, online platforms, and language apps, all designed to facilitate effective learning without the stress of navigating a new culture.Moreover, studying in one's home country allows individuals to maintain a stable living situation, which can lead to better focus on academics. The pressure of adapting to a foreign culture and environment can sometimes hinder the learning process. By studying domestically, learners can engage with the language through a familiar context, thereby improving retention.On the contrary, immersive learning in a foreign country does offer advantages, such as the opportunity for real-time practice and cultural exposure. However, not everyone can afford this experience, making it less accessible.In conclusion, while both methods have their benefits, learning a foreign language in one's own country is often more advantageous. It provides structured learning, emotional support, and accessibility, making it a preferable choice for many aspiring bilingual speakers. In a world where communication is key, the ability to learn a foreign language effectively is crucial, regardless of the environment in which it is acquired.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;The debate over whether students should have one long vacation each year or several shorter ones is an important topic in educational discussions. While some advocate for a single extended break, I firmly believe that multiple short vacations throughout the academic year are more beneficial for students. Several reasons support this viewpoint.Many proponents of one long vacation argue that it allows students to recharge and return to their studies with renewed enthusiasm. However, this extended break often leads to a decline in the retention of knowledge, making the transition back to learning challenging. In contrast, having several shorter breaks throughout the year helps maintain a steady academic rhythm. These frequent intervals provide students with regular opportunities to re-energize, preventing academic fatigue and burnout.One of the most crucial advantages of multiple vacations is that they help to lower stress levels among students. The continuous pressure of assignments and exams can be overwhelming. Short breaks allow time for relaxation and personal reflection, enabling students to return to their studies with clarity and focus. For instance, students might use these breaks to pursue interests outside of their academic work or to engage in leisure activities, which can significantly enhance their overall well-being and academic performance.Moreover, frequent vacations can enhance motivation. Knowing that a break is on the horizon can encourage students to work diligently during the school terms. It creates a balanced schedule that fosters a proactive approach to learning. This model ensures students remain engaged in their studies, consistently reinforced by periodic respites that promote mental health.In conclusion, while extended vacations can offer temporary relief, the multitude of benefits derived from several short breaks make them a more effective approach. They support lower stress levels, increased motivation, and improved academic performance, thus enriching the educational experience for students.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";The expression “Never, never give up” serves as a powerful reminder of the resilience and determination necessary to achieve our goals. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. Life is often filled with challenges and setbacks, but the ability to persevere can be the key to eventual success. My personal experience illustrates this point vividly.At the age of nearly thirty, I found myself on a journey towards a significant goal: winning a medal in a competitive sport. Initially, my attempts to attain this goal were met with numerous obstacles. There were days when I felt utterly defeated after a poor performance or faced injuries that threatened my progress. In moments of doubt, the temptation to give up loomed large. However, I recognized that the road to success is rarely a straight path. It often requires embracing failure as a learning opportunity.Through relentless practice, consistent effort, and a commitment to improvement, I slowly began to see progress. Each setback became a stepping stone rather than a roadblock. The support of friends and mentors further inspired me to remain focused and dedicated. Finally, after years of hard work and perseverance, I achieved my goal—I won a medal. This achievement not only brought me immense joy but also instilled a sense of pride in my ability to face adversity without giving up.This experience solidified my belief in the importance of perseverance. Whether pursuing athletic achievements, academic success, or personal dreams, maintaining a resilient mindset can lead individuals to realize their aspirations. In a world often quick to dismiss efforts after initial failures, embracing the motto “never, never give up” can inspire others to continue striving for their goals. Ultimately, success is often just around the corner for those who refuse to quit.
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;In recent years, the majority of developed countries have experienced notably low saving rates, as many people choose to enjoy their earnings immediately or even take out loans to fund their expenses. While the thrill of spending money can be tempting, I believe that saving a portion of one’s earnings is essential, primarily because future economic circumstances are inherently unpredictable.One of the primary reasons to prioritize saving is the financial security it provides. Unexpected events—such as medical emergencies, job loss, or significant repairs—can lead to unforeseen expenses that can strain an individual’s finances. In such scenarios, having a financial cushion can ease stress and provide a sense of stability. For example, individuals with savings are likely to fare better during economic downturns than those who spend recklessly or rely solely on credit. With savings in place, they have the flexibility to weather tough situations without plunging into debt.Additionally, societal trends indicate that consumer culture can often lead to a cycle of dependency on credit. To finance immediate desires, many individuals opt for loans, which can escalate into overwhelming debt. By contrast, those who save regularly develop healthy financial habits and avoid the pitfalls of high-interest debt. This approach allows them to make more informed decisions regarding large purchases or investments in their future, such as homeownership or education.Lastly, saving fosters a mindset of planning for the future. By prioritizing savings, individuals can focus on long-term goals, such as retirement or starting a business. The discipline of saving instills a greater sense of financial awareness and responsibility.In conclusion, while enjoying the present is important, the unpredictable nature of life necessitates that individuals take a more balanced approach to their finances. Saving a portion of one’s earnings not only provides security and avoids debt but also encourages future planning. Thus, cultivating a saving habit ultimately paves the way for a more stable and rewarding financial future.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;In today's fast-paced world, the influence of modern technologies and globalization has increased the speed of life tremendously. With instant communication, rapid transportation, and the constant pressure to meet deadlines, many people find themselves perpetually in a hurry. While this lifestyle may seem productive, I firmly believe that embracing a slower pace of life is essential for overall well-being, as living in a hurry comes with several disadvantages.Firstly, a fast-paced lifestyle often leads to heightened stress levels. The relentless pursuit of efficiency can create an environment where individuals feel overwhelmed by their responsibilities and commitments. Studies have shown that chronic stress can result in serious health issues, including anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular problems. In contrast, taking time to slow down allows for better mental health management and overall wellness. By savoring each moment and engaging mindfully in activities, individuals can foster a sense of peace and balance in their lives.Furthermore, living life at a slower pace enhances the quality of experiences. When rushing through daily tasks, we often miss out on opportunities for meaningful connections and personal growth. For example, taking time to enjoy a leisurely meal with family and friends fosters strong relationships and deeper bonds that can be neglected in the hustle of modern living. Engaging with our surroundings at a slower pace allows us to appreciate the beauty of nature, the intricacies of our environment, and the subtleties of human interaction, enriching our lives in a profound way.In conclusion, while the world may advocate for a fast-paced existence driven by modern technologies and globalization, I believe that living at a slower pace holds significant value. The benefits of reduced stress and increased engagement in life far outweigh the allure of constant hurry, leading to a healthier, more fulfilling existence. Embracing a slower lifestyle enables us to not only enjoy life more fully but also to nurture our mental and emotional well-being.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;The ongoing debate between prioritizing human needs such as farmland, housing, and industry versus the preservation of land for endangered animals is increasingly relevant in today’s world. While it is essential to acknowledge the pressing need for development due to our rapidly growing population—now exceeding seven billion for the first time in history—it is crucial to consider the broader implications of neglecting our responsibility to the environment.As the human population expands, we are forcefully encroaching on natural habitats by converting forests, jungles, and lakes into agricultural land or urban areas. This destruction not only robs entire ecosystems of their balance but also leads to the extinction of numerous species, disrupting the intricate web of life that sustains us all. Every organism, no matter how small, plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance. When we prioritize short-term human gains over the preservation of biodiversity, we risk losing these essential components of our planet's health.Moreover, a stable and sustainable environment is paramount for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. Our expansionist approach has contributed to weather disturbances and increasingly severe environmental conditions, underscored by systematic pollution. The degradation of wetlands and forests compromises nature's ability to regulate the climate, leading to unpredictable weather patterns that threaten food security, health, and safety.In conclusion, while human needs are undeniably important, they should not come at the expense of endangered species and ecosystems. Protecting these environments ensures a stable climate and preserves biodiversity, which is crucial for our survival. Hence, it is imperative to pursue sustainable development that harmonizes human needs with environmental preservation, ensuring that future generations inherit a planet that thrives biologically and climatically.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;The debate surrounding whether university students should be required to attend classes or if attendance should be optional is one that generates diverse opinions. Some advocate for mandatory attendance, arguing that the structure and accountability inherent in required classes foster a disciplined learning environment. Others, however, contend that university students, being adults, should have the autonomy to make their own choices regarding attendance. I align with the latter perspective, believing that university-level education should empower students to take charge of their own learning experience.Firstly, university students possess a level of maturity that allows them to make informed choices about their education. Unlike high school, where attendance policies may play a critical role in the development of younger adolescents, university students are often motivated by their personal and career aspirations. They are capable of evaluating whether attending a specific class is beneficial to them or if they can grasp the material through alternative methods, such as independent research or online resources. Moreover, it is important to recognize that not all classes are equally engaging or valuable. There are instances where attending a lecture may feel like a waste of time, particularly if the content is poorly delivered or not aligned with students' goals. On the other hand, some lecturers possess the ability to captivate their audience and provide insightful, engaging lectures. In such cases, attendance naturally becomes important to students who appreciate the value of learning from these educators.In conclusion, while some people believe that class attendance should be compulsory to instill discipline, I argue that university students should have the option to choose. They are mature enough to assess their educational needs and determine how best to meet them, making optional attendance a more beneficial approach in higher education.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;"In today’s fast-paced world, the debate regarding whether technology simplifies or complicates life remains a pertinent topic. Many individuals find themselves grappling with this question, often feeling uncertain about the impact of technological advancements on their daily existence. While it's true that technology has introduced certain complexities, I firmly concede that the convenience and efficiency it brings ultimately outweigh any complications.To illustrate, consider the multitude of tasks that technology has streamlined. Communication has evolved dramatically; with the advent of smartphones and instant messaging apps, staying in touch with loved ones across vast distances has never been easier. This immediacy not only fosters relationships but also allows for quick problem-solving in both personal and professional contexts. Moreover, online platforms enable access to a wealth of information and resources, empowering individuals to educate themselves and make informed decisions rapidly.Furthermore, advancements in technology have revolutionized daily chores, making them less time-consuming. Smart home devices, for instance, can automate tasks ranging from adjusting the thermostat to managing grocery lists, thereby optimizing time management. As a result, people can focus on more meaningful activities rather than getting bogged down by mundane tasks.Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that the rapid pace of technological change can lead to feelings of overwhelm. Many individuals may find it challenging to keep up with constant updates and new applications, leading to confusion. However, this complexity is often a temporary hurdle in the face of a larger, beneficial transformation.In conclusion, while technology may introduce certain complications into our lives, its ability to simplify processes, enhance communication, and save time is undeniable. Embracing technology does not mean relinquishing control; rather, it offers an opportunity to harness tools that foster growth and productivity, ultimately making our lives better and more manageable."
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";In today's world, it is undeniable that media outlets such as television, newspapers, and magazines allocate an overwhelming amount of attention to the personal lives of celebrities and public figures. I firmly agree with the statement that this focus often veers into the realm of the superficial, driven by multiple factors.First and foremost, media organizations cater to an audience that thrives on the allure of celebrity culture. The fascination with the personal lives of famous individuals serves primarily to boost viewership and readership. Outlets capitalize on high-profile gossip, relationships, and scandals, knowing that such content generates clicks, views, and ultimately revenue. This trend reflects a broader societal fixation on fame and the lifestyles of the rich and famous, often sidelining more pressing issues that demand public interest and discourse.Moreover, the modern age has bred a culture where appearance and superficiality overshadow substance. Social media platforms, in conjunction with traditional media, have cultivated an environment that glorifies the glamorous aspects of life while neglecting the importance of meaningful dialogue surrounding social, political, or economic matters. As a result, the personal lives of celebrities are scrutinized and sensationalized, while significant issues often struggle for a platform. This reflects a warped value system in which gossip takes precedence over critical thinking and informed discussion.In conclusion, the extensive attention that mass media pays to celebrities' personal lives is not only indicative of a superficial societal norm but also a tactic to maintain audience engagement and profitability. As consumers of this media, it is vital that we critically evaluate the information presented to us and advocate for a media landscape that prioritizes depth, relevance, and substantive narratives over mindless gossip.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;"The question of whether to stay in one place or to move in search of new experiences has captivated many. As someone who was born and grew up in a small town, I find myself firmly planted in favor of staying in one place. This preference is rooted in my deep appreciation for the friendships and connections I have fostered over the years, which are integral to my sense of belonging.In my small town, I enjoy a rich tapestry of social relationships that span the years. My friends are not just acquaintances; they are people who have shared pivotal moments of my life with me, who understand my background, and who support me in both good times and challenges. This strong social network provides a sense of security and stability that is hard to replicate in an unfamiliar environment.Additionally, the traffic in our town has a distinct charm. Unlike the chaos of bustling cities, my town's streets are characterized by their familiarity and ease of navigation. I find comfort in the predictable rhythms of the community, where I can walk or bike, reveling in a tranquil pace that allows for reflection and connection with nature. Furthermore, the environment in my town is wonderful. The lush parks, serene landscapes, and welcoming neighbors create a nurturing atmosphere that fosters growth and happiness. The beauty of my surroundings contributes to my overall well-being, making it a perfect backdrop for creating memories and enjoying everyday life.In conclusion, although exploring new places can be thrilling, I strongly feel that the advantages of staying in one place outweigh the allure of transience. My small town is not just my home; it is a sanctuary where relationships flourish and the environment enchants. This makes me value stability and the deep-rooted connections that come with being rooted in one place."
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;Choosing a place to live while attending university significantly influences a student's social life and academic success. Two prevalent options are university dormitories and apartments in the community, each offering distinct advantages. Living in a university dormitory provides students with the opportunity to immerse themselves in the academic environment. It facilitates easier access to classes, libraries, and campus resources, fostering a sense of belonging. Furthermore, dormitories typically encourage social interaction among residents, making it easier to form friendships and collaborate on academic projects. Living closely with peers also promotes community and support, which can be vital during stressful periods such as exam weeks.Conversely, living in an apartment off campus offers students a chance to ease into the realities of adult life. This arrangement encourages independence and responsibility—qualities that are crucial in the workforce. For instance, students must manage their bills, maintain the cleanliness of their space, and cook for themselves. These experiences teach valuable life skills such as budgeting, time management, and cooperation with roommates. Moreover, living outside of university housing often allows for greater flexibility in terms of living arrangements, lifestyle, and personal space.Personally, I would prefer to live in an off-campus apartment. While the social environment of a dormitory is appealing, I believe that the skills and lessons gained from living independently are essential for my future. The experiences of managing daily responsibilities and learning to navigate real-world challenges will prepare me for life after university. Independence fosters personal growth, and I would value the ability to create a living space that reflects my individuality. In summary, while both options have their merits, living in an apartment offers a more comprehensive preparation for life beyond academia.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;In today’s rapidly evolving world, the debate between the merits of working quickly versus the necessity of caution is increasingly relevant. I firmly believe that in many instances, the ability to work quickly, even at the risk of making mistakes, is more advantageous than moving slowly to ensure absolute correctness. First and foremost, speed allows individuals to adapt and learn more effectively. When one works rapidly, there is a greater opportunity to engage with various tasks and problems, ultimately leading to increased knowledge and skill development. In industries that are fast-paced, such as technology and finance, speed can be the key to staying relevant and competitive. Moreover, the rising cost of living has compelled many people to augment their income by taking on multiple jobs. This trend often necessitates a faster work pace. Individuals who can juggle two or three jobs in a week might face the challenge of managing time efficiently, which requires a certain level of risk in their work. While mistakes are inevitable, having the flexibility to work quickly allows them to meet their financial needs despite the potential errors.Conversely, those who prioritize slow, meticulous work may find themselves struggling to keep up. In an environment where deadlines are tight and the volume of work continues to grow, a slower pace can lead to overwhelm and inability to handle multiple tasks. This can significantly hinder one’s professional development and the ability to adapt to new challenges.In conclusion, while careful and deliberate work is important in certain contexts, the realities of our modern world often necessitate a quicker approach. Embracing speed, despite the inherent risks, can provide the learning opportunities and financial flexibility that are crucial in today’s society. Thus, I advocate for a balanced perspective that values quick, albeit imperfect, work as a practical strategy in overcoming contemporary challenges.
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;"The debate over whether university attendance is necessary for students to succeed in their exams has been a contentious one. While it is true that some may advocate for the notion that as long as students can pass the exam, attending classes becomes irrelevant, I strongly disagree with this perspective. My stance is rooted in the belief that true learning and mastery of university knowledge cannot be fully achieved solely through exam preparation.Firstly, no student, regardless of their capabilities or study methods, is an expert in every aspect of a subject. University education is not just a means to obtain a passing grade; it is designed to be a comprehensive learning experience. Each class offers valuable insights, discussions, and interactions that contribute to a deeper understanding of complex topics. By attending classes, students have the opportunity to engage with professors and peers, opening themselves up to different viewpoints and interpretations that aid in their intellectual growth.Furthermore, the classroom environment fosters collaboration and critical thinking, skills that are essential not only for exam success but also for real-world applications. These interactions are instrumental in developing the ability to analyze information and to present it effectively, which are crucial competencies in any professional field. Learning is not merely about rote memorization for exams but rather about cultivating a mindset that embraces inquiry and exploration.In addition, the pressure to pass exams can lead some students to prioritize short-term retention of information over long-term mastery. This approach is counterproductive and can lead to knowledge gaps that may impact their future careers. Thus, the experience of attending classes is integral to a well-rounded education.In conclusion, while passing exams is important, it should not diminish the value of classroom attendance. It is through active participation in university classes that students can truly acquire the knowledge and skills essential for their academic and professional journeys. Therefore, university education should encourage attendance, engagement, and genuine learning above all."
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;"Education is undeniably a cornerstone of personal and societal development, with university education playing a pivotal role in shaping a student's future. While some argue that increasing salaries for university professors is essential to improving educational quality, I maintain that funds should be allocated to enhancing facilities and updating resources for students. Professors are undoubtedly crucial to the educational process; their knowledge and guidance help shape the minds of future leaders. However, it is essential to recognize that universities exist primarily for the benefit of students. Therefore, the focus should be on enriching the student experience. High salaries for professors may lead to a more comfortable living for them, but if students lack access to modern teaching tools, libraries, laboratories, and updated technology, the core objective of education remains unfulfilled.Investing in facilities means creating an environment where students can thrive. For instance, well-equipped labs can enhance hands-on learning, while updated libraries stocked with the latest research materials can facilitate academic inquiry. Moreover, universities could benefit from improving their campuses, making them more conducive to collaboration and innovation among students. A well-designed learning environment can significantly boost student engagement and satisfaction, ultimately leading to better educational outcomes.Moreover, using funds to provide scholarships or financial aid can have a more pronounced impact on student success. By reducing financial burdens, universities would enable a broader demographic of students to access higher education, promoting diversity and inclusion.In conclusion, while the importance of university professors cannot be overstated, prioritizing their salaries over resources that directly enhance the student experience may not lead to the desired improvements in educational quality. Investing in facilities, technology, and support systems is a more effective strategy for fostering an enriching educational environment that benefits students in a meaningful way."
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;"The debate over whether pets should be treated like family members is a nuanced one, with compelling arguments supporting both sides. However, I firmly agree with the notion that pets deserve to be treated as integral members of our families.Firstly, pets serve as steadfast companions, often providing emotional support in ways that are uniquely profound. They don’t judge us or hold grudges; instead, they listen attentively to our woes, often offering a comforting presence when we need it most. In times of stress or loneliness, the gentle nudge of a pet can feel more understanding than the words of some people. This bond between humans and pets cultivates a sense of loyalty and unconditional love that mirrors familial relationships.Furthermore, the utility of pets extends beyond companionship. The phenomenon of pet therapy has risen substantially in recent years, demonstrating the positive impact animals can have on mental health. Trained therapy animals assist individuals grappling with anxiety, depression, and trauma, providing comfort and a sense of security. This therapeutic bond illustrates that pets contribute significantly to human well-being, akin to how family members support one another during challenging times.Opponents argue that pets, being animals, cannot think or feel like humans do, and therefore they should not be elevated to the status of family members. While it is true that pets may not possess human cognitive abilities, their emotional intelligence and capacity for attachment are indisputable. They exhibit loyalty, affection, and even joy—qualities that are inherently human and deserving of acknowledgment.In conclusion, the argument for treating pets as family members is strongly supported by the emotional connections we share and their invaluable contributions to our mental health. Recognizing the unique relationship between humans and their pets fosters a deeper appreciation for the love and joy these animals bring to our lives."
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;When it comes to choosing between living in a small town or a big city, I prefer the vibrant atmosphere of larger urban environments. This preference stems from several compelling factors that make city life appealing.Firstly, the excitement that a big city offers is hard to resist. Cities are dynamic hubs, constantly teeming with energy and activity. There are always new events, cultures, and experiences awaiting discovery. From art exhibitions and live music to diverse culinary experiences and community festivals, the variety is virtually limitless. For someone like me who thrives on novelty, living in this fast-paced environment can be an incredibly rich experience. The vibrant atmosphere ignites creativity and fosters a sense of adventure, making life feel more engaging.Additionally, big cities tend to provide greater career opportunities and the potential for higher income. The concentration of businesses and industries in urban areas often leads to a more competitive job market, which can result in better advancements for those who are willing to work hard. In a larger city, the diversity of employment options allows individuals to pursue careers in various fields, be it technology, finance, or the arts. Such abundance is typically absent in small towns, where job offerings may be limited, often leading to fewer opportunities for personal and professional growth. Having access to a wider array of potential employers not only enhances the chance of obtaining a desirable job but also fosters a stimulating professional environment.In conclusion, while small towns may offer a sense of tranquility, the excitement and opportunities that big cities provide are far more aligned with my lifestyle and aspirations. The allure of urban life, characterized by its vibrant energy and professional prospects, ultimately makes city living my preferred choice.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";In contemporary society, the question of whether government funds should prioritize new building construction over the preservation of historic or traditional buildings prompts a robust debate. While preserving our cultural heritage is significant, I argue that it is more imperative for governments to channel funds into new constructions that meet the basic needs of the populace.First and foremost, the primary responsibility of any government is to ensure the well-being of its citizens. Modern life necessitates secure, functional, and accommodating homes. As urban populations continue to grow, the demand for adequate housing rises substantially. Investing in the construction of new buildings directly addresses this pressing need, providing people with safe shelters that foster harmonious living conditions. Without sufficient access to decent housing, a community's social fabric can fray, leading to increased poverty, homelessness, and societal discord.Additionally, prioritizing new building projects can also lead to economic growth. New construction creates jobs, stimulates local economies, and can even enhance the city's infrastructure. By developing modern facilities, governments can draw in investment, boost tourism, and improve public services, thus contributing to the overall prosperity of the community.Although the preservation of historic or traditional buildings carries undeniable value in maintaining cultural identity and heritage, it should not overshadow the immediate and pressing needs of the population. Governments can find a balance between both priorities, but the current reality suggests that the urgent need for functional living spaces should take precedence.In conclusion, while historic preservation holds importance, it is crucial for governments to focus first on new building constructions. By addressing the fundamental need for housing, they ensure that citizens can lead fulfilling, harmonious lives, thereby fostering a stable and thriving society.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;I firmly agree with the statement that many experiences in our lives, which initially seem difficult, eventually transform into invaluable lessons for the future. Difficulties serve as catalysts for growth and skill development, shaping us into more resilient individuals.One reason I hold this belief is that every challenging experience enhances our skill set and improves our decision-making abilities. For instance, consider the process of learning to ride a bicycle. Initially, falling and scraping knees can be disheartening and painful, yet these very struggles teach the importance of balance and coordination. As a child learns to navigate these obstacles, they gain confidence and a sense of accomplishment. Similarly, in adulthood, facing challenges in a job or personal relationships often forces us to develop new strategies and problem-solving skills. These trials yield wisdom that can guide future decisions, ultimately enriching our lives.Moreover, difficult experiences fortify us unknowingly, making us robust and strong. For example, individuals who have faced significant hardships, such as loss or failure, often emerge with a deeper understanding of their own resilience. This newfound strength can lead to a greater appreciation of life and a more profound empathy for others in similar situations. I witnessed this firsthand when a close friend experienced setbacks in his career. While initially devastated, he used the experience to reevaluate his goals and aspirations. Ultimately, he found a path that was more aligned with his true interests, illustrating how adversity can lead to personal growth.In conclusion, the challenges we encounter often appear daunting at first, but they serve as essential building blocks for our future. By enhancing our skills and making us more resilient, these experiences ultimately contribute to our overall development. Embracing the lessons learned from our difficulties equips us to navigate the complexities of life with greater confidence and understanding.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";The proposal to charge drivers a fee for navigating busy city streets during peak hours sparks significant debate. Critics argue that this measure would address the exorbitant use of oil and the environmental impact associated with traffic congestion. They contend that imposing additional fees on drivers would encourage them to reconsider their transportation choices and reduce their carbon footprint. However, I firmly disagree with the idea of implementing such a fee.One of the primary reasons for my opposition is that traffic jams are a natural phenomenon that cannot be entirely controlled or prevented by individual drivers. Various factors contribute to traffic congestion, including road construction, accidents, or simply the sheer volume of vehicles on the road. Charging drivers extra during these peak times seems unjust since they are not solely responsible for the conditions that lead to gridlock. It would be unreasonable to penalize individuals for circumstances largely outside their control.Furthermore, imposing fees could disproportionately affect low-income drivers who may not have the luxury of alternative transportation options. If the primary motivation for charging these fees stems from selfish conduct, as some critics argue, then we must consider that many drivers are simply attempting to fulfill necessary obligations, such as commuting to work or transporting family members. Penalizing them further only serves to exacerbate socioeconomic divides.In conclusion, while the desire to alleviate traffic congestion and encourage environmentally friendly practices is commendable, charging drivers a fee during peak hours is not a viable solution. Traffic congestion is a complex issue arising from various factors beyond individual control. Therefore, rather than imposing fees, we should focus on enhancing public transportation, improving road infrastructure, and promoting alternative modes of travel to address the root causes of traffic congestion effectively.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is indeed by encouraging them to take on a part-time job. This experience can be invaluable, providing teenagers with real-world exposure that school cannot fully replicate. As parents often point out, adult life comes with its own sets of challenges, responsibilities, and stresses that differ significantly from the relative ease of school life. However, without firsthand experience, teenagers may find it difficult to truly understand these pressures.Taking a part-time job allows teenagers to step outside their comfort zones and engage with the realities of adult life. They learn essential skills such as time management, teamwork, and communication, which are crucial in any professional setting. Moreover, holding a job teaches them the concept of financial responsibility, helping them to understand the value of money and the importance of budgeting. This practical knowledge can immensely benefit them later as they navigate their financial independence.In contrast, spending excessive time on activities like playing video games does not foster the same depth of understanding about life’s responsibilities. While gaming can have its benefits, it often becomes a passive way to spend valuable time. By taking on part-time work, teenagers not only utilize their time more effectively, but they also develop a strong work ethic and learn to appreciate the effort that goes into earning money and achieving goals.In conclusion, encouraging teenagers to take part-time jobs is an excellent way for parents to help them prepare for adult life. Such experiences cultivate vital skills and provide a realistic insight into the challenges ahead, making it a far more constructive use of their time compared to idly playing games during holidays. Ultimately, these lessons can significantly ease the transition to adulthood and foster a sense of independence and responsibility.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";"When it comes to studying, the method one adopts can significantly influence their academic success. Various factors contribute to effective learning, including the environment, personal temperament, and individual study techniques. Personally, I prefer to study in a group rather than alone, and this choice is guided by a few compelling reasons.To begin with, I find that my temperament plays a vital role in my study preferences. I tend to become easily distracted when studying alone; my mind often wanders, leading to procrastination. In contrast, studying with a group helps me stay focused and on track. The shared responsibility in a study group creates a structured environment where everyone contributes, and this dynamic encourages accountability. Knowing that my peers are relying on me motivates me to stay engaged and prepared.Moreover, group study fosters collaborative learning. Different individuals bring varying perspectives and problem-solving approaches to the table. When I study with my classmates, I am exposed to diverse viewpoints that enhance my understanding of complex subjects. For instance, during a recent exam preparation session, a peer offered a unique way to approach a challenging math problem, which illuminated a completely new perspective for me. Such collaborative discussions not only deepen my comprehension but also make learning more enjoyable.Additionally, studying in a group can relieve some of the stress associated with preparation. It provides a support system where we can share our uncertainties and encourage one another. This camaraderie alleviates anxiety and fosters a positive atmosphere that is essential for learning.In conclusion, while some may thrive in solitary study environments, I find that group study aligns more with my temperament and enhances my learning experience. The combination of focused accountability, collaborative insights, and emotional support significantly boosts my study achievements. Therefore, I firmly believe that for me, studying with a group is the most effective approach to academic success."
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;The choice between self-employment, working for an employer, or owning a business is a significant decision that shapes one’s professional life. Personally, I would prefer to have my own job. This preference stems from two primary reasons: the value of time and the importance of financial independence.First and foremost, time is the most valuable asset I possess. When I work for myself, I have the flexibility to structure my day as I see fit. This autonomy enables me to allocate time to both my personal and professional pursuits. Living in a fast-paced world, the ability to set my own schedule allows me to maintain a healthy work-life balance, which is often challenging when working for another employer. I can prioritize tasks, take breaks, and engage in activities that energize me, ultimately leading to greater productivity and job satisfaction.Secondly, earning money is indeed a fundamental reason for pursuing a job. The amount of money I make is a critical criterion influencing my choice of work. Being self-employed provides the potential for higher earnings compared to a traditional job, where salaries are often fixed. With my own business or job, I can determine my income based on my effort, skills, and the demand for my services. The prospect of creating value and being rewarded appropriately is a significant motivator for me. Additionally, self-employment presents opportunities for financial growth through reinvestment and innovation, aspects that attract many individuals to entrepreneurship.In conclusion, while there are challenges associated with self-employment and owning a business, I find the advantages compelling. The flexibility of time and the potential for greater financial return align perfectly with my personal and professional aspirations. Thus, in the pursuit of work, I am inclined to carve out my own path rather than conform to the conventional choices of employment.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";"The debate over whether to preserve historic buildings or replace them with modern structures is a contentious one faced by many cities around the world. I firmly believe that cities should invest in preserving their old, historic buildings for several compelling reasons.Firstly, historic buildings are important treasures that serve as tangible connections to our past. They tell stories of the people and cultures who inhabited the area, offering valuable insights into their lifestyles, traditions, and values. For instance, the architectural style of a historic church can reveal religious practices and community priorities from centuries ago. By preserving these structures, we are not just conserving bricks and mortar; we are safeguarding a narrative of human history that provides contemporary society with lessons in resilience, adaptability, and creativity.Furthermore, historic buildings can play a pivotal role in developing tourism industries. Cities known for their preserved architecture often attract visitors seeking authentic experiences and cultural enrichment. For example, cities like Prague, Rome, and Istanbul thrive on their rich historical environments, drawing millions of tourists annually who wish to marvel at their unique heritage. The influx of tourists can stimulate the local economy, creating jobs and supporting small businesses such as restaurants, shops, and guided tours. This economic boost makes a compelling case for preservation over demolition.Additionally, historic buildings often possess architectural features and craftsmanship that are increasingly rare in modern construction. They provide aesthetic value that enhances the character and charm of neighborhoods, differentiating them from uniformly constructed contemporary buildings. Preserving these structures contributes to the uniqueness of a city, fostering community pride and engagement.In conclusion, the preservation of historic buildings should be a priority for cities. They are not only important cultural treasures that educate us about our past, but they also enhance tourism and contribute economically to the community. By maintaining our heritage, we lay a foundation for future generations to appreciate and learn from the significant narratives woven into the very fabric of our society."
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;"The statement that ""parents are the best teachers"" resonates deeply with many individuals who believe that the foundation of learning begins in the home. From the moment we take our first breaths, our parents become our initial guides, teaching us the simplest of skills: how to smile, to crawl, and eventually to walk. These early lessons set the stage for a lifetime of learning and development, illustrating that parental influence is profound and far-reaching.As we grow, parents continue to impart crucial knowledge that goes beyond academic skills. They are often our first instructors in morality, ethics, and social behavior. Through conversations, stories, and personal examples, parents teach us the importance of kindness, honesty, and responsibility. For instance, when a child witnesses their parent helping a neighbor or standing up for a friend, they absorb valuable lessons about compassion and integrity. These teachings can shape a person's character throughout their life.Furthermore, we spend a significant portion of our formative years at home, which allows parents to have a more consistent and impactful role in our education. While schools provide academic lessons, they often cannot replicate the nurturing and supportive environment that a family setting offers. Parents know us intimately—they understand our strengths, weaknesses, and unique learning styles. This knowledge enables them to tailor their teaching methods to suit our individual needs, fostering a love for learning that can last a lifetime.In conclusion, while formal education is undeniably important, I believe parents are the best teachers because they instill critical life skills and values that shape our identities. The lessons learned at home often become the bedrock of our character and influence our decisions long after we leave the nest. Thus, the education we receive from our parents is irreplaceable and enduring."
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;"The debate surrounding the attributes that contribute to success in a new job often boils down to two key abilities: adaptability to a new environment and possessing excellent knowledge of the job. I firmly believe that while the ability to adapt is crucial, the importance of having comprehensive knowledge of the job cannot be overlooked and should not be underestimated.Firstly, the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is undeniably essential. Navigating a new workplace often involves understanding its culture, dynamics, and the expectations of colleagues and superiors. Adaptable employees can quickly integrate themselves into teams, create positive relationships, and respond effectively to change. These attributes are particularly beneficial in today’s fast-paced job market, where the only constant is change. However, adaptation is just one piece of the puzzle; it serves as a foundation upon which successful job performance is built.On the other hand, possessing excellent knowledge of one’s job cannot be discounted. This expertise not only helps employees perform their tasks effectively but also positions them as invaluable assets to their companies. Knowledgeable workers can drive projects forward, mentor less experienced colleagues, and contribute to the company’s overall success and reputation. While adapting allows for integration, it is the depth of knowledge that sustains performance and fosters innovation in the long run.Moreover, working alone, even for an adaptable employee, can be a slower journey to success than collaborating with others who possess sound knowledge. Teams thrive when they combine both adaptability and expertise. An employee with excellent knowledge can lead initiatives, solve problems efficiently, and ultimately benefit the entire organization.In conclusion, while adaptability is an essential skill in a new job, I argue that excellent knowledge of the job is equally, if not more, important for long-term success. The ideal employee embodies both qualities, ensuring a seamless integration into new environments while delivering high-quality work that fosters growth and development."
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;The role of computers in modern society is undeniably significant, with many advocating that they have made life easier and more convenient. However, there is another side to this issue, where some argue that they have also complicated our lives and added stress. In my opinion, while computers have facilitated numerous advancements and streamlined processes, they have also introduced complexities that cannot be ignored.Firstly, computers play an essential role in various industries, including economics and business. They have revolutionized the way we conduct transactions, manage data, and communicate with one another. For instance, businesses can utilize software to analyze market trends and customer behavior efficiently, leading to informed decision-making. Additionally, e-commerce has transformed shopping into a convenient experience, allowing customers to purchase goods from the comfort of their homes. However, the integration of computers into the workforce has led to a significant reduction in human roles. Automation and artificial intelligence have replaced many traditional jobs, especially in manufacturing and data entry sectors. This technological displacement can result in increased unemployment and insecurity, leaving workers frustrated and anxious about their prospects. This inherent stress stems from the need to adapt to new skill sets to remain relevant in an ever-evolving job market.Moreover, with the rapid influx of information available at our fingertips, people often face information overload. The constant barrage of notifications, emails, and updates can lead to feelings of being overwhelmed. This complexity can disturb work-life balance and contribute to a heightened sense of stress.In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly streamlined many processes and made aspects of life more manageable, they have also introduced a new level of complexity and stress. The challenge lies in leveraging the advantages of technology while addressing the negative impacts it has on employment and mental health. In navigating this balance, society can aspire to make better use of computers without compromising individual well-being.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;In today’s interconnected world, the ability to communicate in multiple languages is increasingly valuable. I firmly agree that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. This practice not only strengthens their cognitive abilities but also broadens their perspectives on global cultures and societies.First and foremost, learning a foreign language enhances children's cognitive development. Research has shown that bilingualism can improve memory, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking. For instance, when children learn a new language, they engage in complex cognitive tasks that encourage them to think differently and creatively. This intellectual stimulation helps build neural pathways in the brain, strengthening memory and overall learning capabilities. Consequently, children who are exposed to foreign languages at an early age often demonstrate improved academic performance across various subjects.Moreover, acquiring a foreign language early in life allows children to develop a deeper understanding of different cultures. Language is a window into a nation’s customs, traditions, and worldviews. By learning another language, children gain insights into the lives of people from different backgrounds, which can foster empathy and cultural appreciation. For example, a child learning Spanish not only practices vocabulary but also explores the rich history and diverse cultures of Spanish-speaking countries. This exposure can cultivate global citizens who are more tolerant and open-minded.In conclusion, beginning foreign language education in childhood is of paramount importance. It not only sharpens cognitive functions but also expands children’s horizons by connecting them with different cultures. As our world continues to evolve and globalize, equipping young learners with the tools of language will empower them to thrive in a multifaceted environment. Schools should prioritize foreign language instruction from the outset, ensuring that our future generations are well-prepared for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;The debate on whether boys and girls should attend separate schools has been ongoing for years, with valid arguments on both sides. However, I strongly believe that boys and girls should study together. This mixed environment fosters mutual understanding, respect, and collaboration between the sexes, which are vital skills for adulthood.One of the primary advantages of coeducational schooling is the opportunity for students to engage with one another regularly. When boys and girls learn alongside each other, they develop essential social skills needed to navigate various situations in life. For instance, a boy who regularly interacts with girls is likely to understand how to communicate respectfully and confidently in different contexts, be it casual conversations or more formal settings. Similarly, girls can benefit from learning to express themselves around boys, which can enhance their comfort in diverse social and professional environments.While some experts argue that coeducation may lead to distractions and challenges, these issues can often be mitigated through effective teaching strategies and a strong school culture that promotes inclusiveness. The potential disadvantages of coeducation should not overshadow the benefits of students developing skills in a diverse environment. Moreover, separating genders may reinforce stereotypes and make it more challenging for students to engage with the opposite sex as they grow older, leading to social discomfort and misunderstanding.In conclusion, while the arguments for single-sex education are worth considering, the advantages of boys and girls attending the same school far outweigh the disadvantages. Coeducational settings nurture essential life skills, promote gender equality, and prepare students for a collaborative future, ensuring they are equipped to face the complexities of modern society.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";"Success in life is a multifaceted concept that draws on various elements, including risk-taking and careful planning. In my opinion, while careful planning is undeniably important, success often hinges on the willingness to take calculated risks. This perspective resonates with the famous words of Aristotle: ""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" Many individuals fear the prospect of failure and, as a result, choose to play it safe, missing out on potential opportunities for growth and achievement. However, life’s most remarkable successes frequently arise from courageous decisions made amidst uncertainty. When people take risks, they step outside their comfort zones, allowing them to explore uncharted territories and, ultimately, discover new paths to success.One of the most prominent examples of this is Walt Disney. Despite facing significant challenges throughout his career, including bankruptcy and relentless criticism, Disney never gave up on his dreams. His willingness to take risks led to the creation of one of the most beloved entertainment empires in the world. Each animated film he produced and every theme park he built was a leap of faith, demonstrating that embracing risk can lead to extraordinary achievements.On the other hand, careful planning certainly has its merits; it provides structure and direction. However, it is often through the amalgamation of planning and the courage to take risks that individuals find true success. Without the willingness to act on bold ideas, plans remain just that—ideas without the wings to soar.In conclusion, while careful planning is crucial, the essence of success lies in the courage to take risks. Embracing uncertainty, much like Walt Disney did, opens doors to opportunities that might never have been considered. For true achievement, it is essential to pursue dreams fearlessly, as success often waits for those brave enough to take the leap."
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";I firmly agree with the statement that people should sometimes engage in activities they do not enjoy. This practice is a fundamental aspect of life that contributes to personal growth, strengthens resilience, and prepares individuals for various responsibilities.Firstly, life is undoubtedly a blend of enjoyable and unenjoyable tasks. Individuals must complete routine chores such as cleaning, grocery shopping, or attending to bills, all of which are not particularly pleasurable but are essential for maintaining a functional and fulfilling life. These mundane activities instill a sense of discipline and responsibility, skills crucial for navigating both personal and professional realms.Secondly, our professional lives often entail numerous tasks that might lack excitement but are necessary for career advancement and stability. For instance, attending conferences, even when they seem boring, can provide valuable insights and networking opportunities. While many may dread participating in team meetings or working with colleagues whose personalities clash with their own, it is essential to understand these situations foster collaboration and build workplace camaraderie. Engaging in these interactions can also enhance conflict resolution skills, an invaluable asset in any job setting.Lastly, undertaking activities that one does not initially enjoy can surprisingly lead to new forms of appreciation or even enjoyment. Trying out different hobbies, facing fears, or pushing oneself out of their comfort zone often uncovers unexpected passions or interests. For example, an individual may reluctantly attend a painting class but later discover a love for art, which could become a fulfilling hobby or even a new career path. In conclusion, while it is natural to gravitate towards enjoyable experiences, embracing tasks that one may not find pleasurable is essential for personal and professional development. It broadens perspectives, fosters essential life skills, and can even catalyze newfound passions. Therefore, I firmly believe that engaging in endeavors we do not enjoy is a vital part of leading a balanced and productive life.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;The transition from adolescence to adulthood is marked by a pivotal decision: when and how to gain independence from parents. While some young adults crave immediate freedom and seek to live independently as soon as possible, others find comfort and security in prolonging their stay at home. This issue continues to be contentious, with varying perspectives on the right age for young adults to leave their parents. Personally, I believe that it is more beneficial for young adults to live with their families for a longer period.One key reason for this belief is the multitude of practical advantages that come with cohabitating with parents. Young adults often face substantial financial burdens when they venture out on their own, including rent, utilities, and other living expenses. Adulting often arrives with unexpected challenges, and living at home can provide a safety net, allowing young adults to save money, pay down student loans, and build a stable foundation for their future. For example, many recent graduates opt to stay with their parents to accumulate the savings necessary for a home deposit. Additionally, living with family fosters indispensable life skills and emotional support. This extended time together allows young adults to learn critical household management skills, such as cooking, budgeting, and time management, in a supportive environment. It can be a platform for developing stronger relationships with family members, facilitating discussions that can equip them with invaluable life lessons and guidance. Furthermore, the current socio-economic climate, characterized by rising housing costs and economic uncertainty, makes it increasingly challenging for young adults to establish independence early. Therefore, allowing them to stay at home until they feel financially and emotionally prepared can positively impact their long-term outcomes. In conclusion, while the drive for independence is a natural part of growing up, the advantages of living with parents for an extended period outweigh the desire for immediate freedom. Young adults can develop essential skills, maintain emotional support, and navigate financial challenges more effectively while remaining at home, ultimately leading to a more stable and successful transition into adulthood.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;Over the last hundred years, technological advancements have profoundly transformed the way people interact with one another, resulting in significant shifts in social relationships. From my perspective, this development has been overwhelmingly positive, despite some drawbacks that merit consideration. Firstly, communication technology, such as smartphones and social media, has made it easier than ever to keep in touch with loved ones who are geographically distant. Families and friends can now connect instantly through video calls, messaging apps, and social networking platforms. This level of accessibility fosters a sense of closeness that was previously unattainable for those separated by vast distances. Long-distance relationships, once fraught with challenges, have become more sustainable and fulfilling, enabling individuals to maintain strong emotional bonds regardless of their physical location.Moreover, technology has democratized the way individuals form new relationships. Online dating platforms and social media have opened up realms of opportunity for people to meet others who share their interests, values, or life circumstances. For those living in remote areas or with limited social circles, these platforms can be lifelines, allowing them to forge connections that might not have been possible otherwise. The ability to form friendships and romantic relationships online has expanded the scope of social interactions, helping people find companionship in an increasingly busy world.However, it is important to acknowledge that this technological shift is not without its drawbacks. Relationships may sometimes lack depth, as digital interactions can feel less personal than face-to-face communication. Additionally, the prevalence of online interaction can lead to feelings of isolation among individuals who replace in-person connections with virtual ones. Despite these challenges, I believe that the overall impact of technology on relationships has been beneficial. The ease of communication and the ability to cultivate diverse relationships cannot be understated. As we continue to navigate this digital landscape, it is essential to find a balance that fosters meaningful connections, ensuring that technology enhances rather than diminishes our social experiences.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The rapid advancement of technology has ushered in an era where machines increasingly perform tasks traditionally carried out by humans. This trend presents both significant advantages and notable disadvantages that warrant examination.Undoubtedly, the benefits that machines bring to society are manifold. For one thing, machines are far more efficient than humans. They can operate continuously without the need for rest, allowing employers to maximize productivity. This ability to work around the clock ensures that high-quality products are produced consistently, while human error—often a result of fatigue—becomes less of a concern. For example, in manufacturing settings, machines can perform repetitive tasks at a speed and accuracy level that far surpasses human capability, leading to faster production times and reduced costs.Moreover, the use of machines can lead to enhanced safety in hazardous working environments. Robots and automated systems can take on dangerous tasks, thereby reducing the risk of injury to human workers. This shift not only protects employees but can also lower insurance costs for companies.However, the increasing reliance on machines also carries disadvantages. One major concern is the potential for job displacement. As machines take over more tasks, many workers may find their skills obsolete, leading to high unemployment rates and economic disparity. This shift poses a significant challenge for societies that must adapt their educational systems to prepare a workforce equipped for a machine-driven future.Additionally, there are ethical considerations surrounding the use of technology. The automation of tasks raises questions about the value of human labor and the inherent worth of work. There is also the risk of over-dependence on machines, which may diminish critical skills over time.In conclusion, while the shift towards machine-led operations presents clear advantages in efficiency and safety, it also poses challenges that society must address. Balancing these benefits and drawbacks will be critical as we continue to integrate technology into our workplaces.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;In the last two decades, the field of information technology (IT) has witnessed remarkable advancements that have revolutionized our daily lives. Innovations like the World Wide Web, email communication, tablets, multicore computers, and interactive boards have facilitated unprecedented connectivity, knowledge sharing, and efficiency. These tools have reshaped education, business, and personal relationships, offering an array of benefits that simplify processes and enhance productivity. For instance, the resolution on modern devices allows for immersive experiences in media consumption and design, enabling creativity to flourish like never before.However, despite these advancements, it is crucial to recognize the potential negative ramifications of ongoing developments in IT. As technology becomes more integrated into our lives, concerns about privacy and security are increasingly pressing. Cybersecurity threats, data breaches, and identity theft have surged, posing significant risks to individuals and organizations alike. Furthermore, the digital divide continues to widen, as access to cutting-edge technology remains limited for marginalized communities, exacerbating social inequalities.Additionally, the rise of artificial intelligence and automation raises questions about the future of employment. While these innovations can increase efficiency, they may also lead to job displacement for many workers, contributing to economic instability. The addiction to digital devices can also negatively affect mental health, leading to issues such as anxiety and depression, particularly in younger generations who are constantly exposed to online pressures.In conclusion, while the last two decades have indeed seen transformative advancements in IT that have significantly improved various aspects of life, it is important to approach future developments with caution. The potential negative effects on security, equality, employment, and mental health suggest that we must consider a balanced perspective on how we navigate the future of technology. Therefore, I agree that future developments in IT may likely result in more negative consequences than positive, unless addressed proactively and equitably.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;"The impact of media coverage of celebrities on children has become a contentious issue in contemporary society. Many people believe that the excessive attention given to famous individuals can have a detrimental effect on young minds, and I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective.Firstly, the nature of fame comes with immense responsibility; celebrities are often seen as role models by impressionable children. When idols indulge in controversial behavior or engage in irresponsible acts, their young admirers can interpret these actions as acceptable or worthy of emulation. This misguided sense of admiration can lead to harmful behaviors, promoting unrealistic standards of success and lifestyle, which may negatively influence children's development and values. For instance, instances of celebrities falling from grace can cause confusion in children who look up to them, creating a discrepancy between the image portrayed by the media and reality.Moreover, the relentless media coverage can distort children's understanding of professional success. Instead of encouraging them to aspire to diverse careers based on their interests and aptitudes, persistent glorification of celebrity culture tends to channel their ambitions toward fame. This focus can lead to disillusionment when children grow up and realize that the path to becoming a celebrity is narrow and often inaccessible, resulting in feelings of inadequacy or failure if they do not achieve similar status.On the other hand, one could argue that not all media representation of celebrities is negative; positive role models do exist and can inspire motivation and creativity. However, the overwhelming majority of celebrity news carries an emphasis on wealth, appearance, and drama rather than meaningful contributions to society.In conclusion, while celebrities can occasionally serve as positive influences, the dominant narrative fostered by media coverage often bears negative implications. It is crucial for parents and educators to mitigate the effects of these messages by reinforcing values of hard work, diverse ambitions, and the importance of character over mere celebrity."
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";In contemporary society, mobile phones have become ubiquitous, infiltrating the lives of people across all age groups. They offer undeniable convenience and entertainment, serving as a gateway to information, communication, and leisure activities. However, I strongly agree with the perspective that this revolutionary device contributes significantly to the erosion of social interaction and fosters several societal issues.Firstly, the reliance on mobile phones often leads individuals to divert their attention from the world around them. Many people frequently engage with their devices, prioritizing virtual interactions over face-to-face communication. This tendency diminishes the quality of relationships, as individuals may find themselves physically present yet emotionally absent during gatherings. Consequently, traditional social interactions, vital for developing meaningful connections, are compromised. The growing preference for texting or social media over direct conversation can lead to feelings of isolation, despite being more connected than ever.Moreover, the excessive use of mobile phones poses physical risks, particularly to children and adolescents. With increased screen time, young people may experience deteriorating eyesight and poor physical posture, leading to long-term health problems. The sedentary lifestyle that often accompanies mobile phone usage can also hinder physical development and promote a lack of physical activity, further impacting social engagement. Children who spend their time glued to screens may miss out on outdoor play and healthy socializing opportunities.In conclusion, while mobile phones undeniably enhance our lives with convenience and entertainment, I concur that they present significant social drawbacks. The tendency to prioritize digital over personal interaction can lead to isolation, weakened relationships, and physical health issues, particularly among the younger generation. To foster a more socially engaged society, it becomes essential to strike a balance between leveraging mobile technology and nurturing interpersonal connections.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;In recent years, modern forms of communication, such as email and instant messaging, have transformed the way we interact with others. While some argue that these technologies have negatively impacted face-to-face interactions, I contend that they offer significant benefits while also presenting undeniable challenges to our social lives.One of the primary advantages of modern communication methods is their ability to facilitate interaction regardless of time or distance. With the click of a button, individuals can connect with friends and family across the globe, bridging geographical divides that previously posed barriers to communication. This immediacy allows for the maintenance of long-distance relationships, enabling people to share experiences and emotions in real time. Moreover, email and messaging provide platforms for networking and collaboration, allowing individuals to engage in discussions and share ideas conveniently and efficiently.However, the increased reliance on digital communication has its drawbacks. The convenience of messaging often leads to a decrease in face-to-face interactions, fostering a culture where virtual connections may replace genuine social experiences. As individuals spend more time texting and emailing, they may find themselves less inclined to engage in person, which can weaken their relationships and diminish the depth of their social lives. Furthermore, relying heavily on screens can signal a decline in social skills, as nonverbal cues are often lost in text-based exchanges.In conclusion, while modern forms of communication like email and messaging have revolutionized the way we connect, they do pose challenges to our traditional social structures. While they enhance our ability to communicate over long distances and foster connections, they can also detract from the richness of face-to-face relationships. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to strike a balance, ensuring that they embrace these technologies while also prioritizing real-world interactions for a fulfilling social life.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";The debate surrounding whether to foster a sense of competition or cooperation in children has generated much discussion among educators and parents alike. Advocates for competition argue that competitive children tend to develop a strong sense of confidence and autonomy. This independence can be crucial as they navigate the complexities of adulthood. Competitive environments often encourage children to push their limits, ultimately preparing them to tackle challenges and make decisions on their own. This self-reliance can translate into better problem-solving skills in various aspects of life, from career decisions to interpersonal relationships.Conversely, supporters of cooperation claim that teaching children to work together fosters qualities that are equally valuable in adulthood. Cooperative children learn to value collaboration, which often leads to innovative problem-solving. In many modern workplaces, the ability to structure and implement new ideas as part of a team is essential. Cooperation encourages open communication, mutual respect, and the sharing of diverse perspectives, resulting in outcomes that are often superior to those achieved alone. By learning to collaborate effectively, these children are likely to thrive in environments that rely on teamwork and communal efforts.Both competition and cooperation hold important lessons for children, and each approach has its distinct benefits. Competitive children may excel in situations that demand decisiveness and assertiveness, while cooperative children may shine in collaborative settings that require shared responsibility and collective ingenuity. Ultimately, the most productive approach may lie in striking a balance between these two philosophies. By blending competitive spirit with cooperative engagement, we can nurture well-rounded individuals who possess the confidence to work independently while also excelling in team-oriented environments. This dual skill set will equip them to face an increasingly complex world, making them not only capable individuals but also effective contributors to society.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;"In today’s fast-paced world, technology has profoundly transformed the way individuals interact with one another. One can observe that the advent of social media platforms, instant messaging apps, and video conferencing tools has exponentially altered the landscape of human relationships. While there are various negative influences associated with these technological advancements, such as reduced face-to-face communication and the potential for superficial connections, I strongly believe that the overall impact of technology has been positive.Firstly, technology has bridged the gap between individuals across vast distances. Friends and family separated by miles can now stay in constant contact through video calls and messaging apps, fostering a sense of closeness that was unimaginable a few decades ago. This connectivity not only strengthens existing relationships but also nurtures new ones. People can form friendships based on shared interests in online forums or social media groups, thereby creating communities that extend beyond geographic limitations.Moreover, technology has facilitated open communication channels that empower individuals to express their thoughts and feelings more freely. For instance, platforms that promote anonymous sharing, such as online support groups, allow individuals to seek assistance and discuss sensitive issues without the fear of judgment or stigma. This support network enhances emotional well-being and builds stronger bonds among participants.Despite concerns regarding the decline of face-to-face interactions, it is essential to recognize that technology does not entirely replace traditional relationships; rather, it complements them. In many cases, online interactions can lead to in-person meetings, thus enriching personal connections.In conclusion, while technology presents certain challenges to interpersonal relationships, its capacity to unite people and foster deeper connections is undeniable. As the world continues to evolve, harnessing the power of technology to strengthen relationships will be essential for societal harmony and progress."
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;The assertion that the development of technology renders traditional skills and ways of life obsolete is a contentious one. While it is undeniable that technological advancement can marginalize age-old practices, to claim that preserving these traditions is pointless overlooks their significant contributions to modern society. Firstly, traditional skills and lifestyles offer invaluable insights into healthcare practices. Many indigenous medicinal remedies have proven effective, often incorporating natural ingredients that modern pharmaceuticals overlook. For instance, the use of herbal medicine has been a cornerstone in various cultures, offering holistic approaches that complement contemporary medical practices. As modern medicine grapples with the side effects of synthetic drugs, a resurgence of traditional health practices could foster a more integrated healthcare model.Moreover, environmental issues facing our planet can benefit from traditional ecological knowledge. Indigenous communities possess a deep understanding of local ecosystems, having cultivated sustainable practices over generations. Their methods of agriculture, land management, and resource conservation can inform modern sustainability efforts. By marrying advanced technology with age-old wisdom, we can develop environmentally friendly solutions that respect both nature and community.Additionally, traditional skills are vital for preserving cultural heritage. They help maintain a sense of identity and continuity, allowing societies to connect with their history and values. This cultural inheritance encourages social cohesion and fosters respect for diversity, which is increasingly important in an interconnected world. The arts, crafts, and rituals that are part of traditional lifestyles enrich modern society by providing a reservoir of knowledge and creativity.In conclusion, while technological advancement is crucial for progress, dismissing traditional skills and ways of life as irrelevant diminishes the potential they have to address contemporary challenges. Upholding these traditions not only safeguards cultural identity but also enhances our capacity to navigate modern complexities in healthcare and environmental stewardship. A balanced approach that values both innovation and tradition is essential for a sustainable future.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;The debate surrounding whether competition or cooperation should be emphasized in childhood development sparks significant interest and differing opinions. Advocates of instilling a sense of competition argue that it fosters ambition and a strong desire to excel. By encouraging children to compete, they develop a drive to learn, improve their skills, and ultimately strive to be the best among their peers. This competitive spirit can cultivate resilience and determination, traits that are invaluable in facing the challenges of adulthood.On the flip side, those who prioritize cooperation maintain that teaching children to work together is essential for their future contributions to society. Cooperation encourages teamwork, communication, and empathy—qualities that are vital not just in school environments but also in workplaces and communities. In an increasingly interconnected world, the ability to collaborate effectively can be more beneficial than individual success. Children who learn to cooperate tend to be more adaptable and capable of navigating complex social dynamics.Both perspectives hold merit, as competition can lead to excellence and personal achievement, while cooperation could lead to stronger interpersonal relationships and community building. The challenge lies in finding a balance between the two. An ideal approach could involve integrating elements of competition in a safe and supportive environment, while also emphasizing the importance of teamwork. For instance, sports can be a platform for healthy competition, but they can also teach kids the value of working together towards a common goal.In conclusion, while competition can drive children to excel academically and personally, cooperation enriches their social skills and community awareness. A holistic approach that balances both values can equip children with a diverse skill set, preparing them well for adulthood. Ultimately, fostering a culture where both competition and cooperation are valued can lead to well-rounded individuals who are both high achievers and effective collaborators.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;The role of advertising in modern society is a subject of much debate, with some asserting that its drawbacks surpass its advantages, while others highlight its significant contributions. This essay will examine both perspectives before presenting a personal viewpoint.Proponents of advertising argue that its benefits are substantial. Advertising serves as an essential tool for businesses to communicate with potential consumers, promoting not only products but also ideas and services. It can stimulate consumer interest and drive competition, ultimately leading to innovation and lower prices. Moreover, the advertising industry generates a plethora of job opportunities, encompassing roles such as producers, writers, models, and cameramen. This employment creation fosters economic growth and supports local and national economies. In the age of digital media, online advertising has proven to be particularly advantageous, offering cheaper costs, convenience for both businesses and consumers, and the ability to analyze consumer behavior efficiently.Conversely, critics of advertising contend that it often perpetuates unrealistic standards and materialism, fostering a culture centered around consumerism. This can lead to detrimental impacts on individuals' self-esteem and well-being, particularly among vulnerable groups such as children and teenagers, who may be more susceptible to advertising messages. Additionally, some advertisements may propagate stereotypes or unethical practices, perpetuating harmful societal norms.In my opinion, while advertising has its detriments, its positives cannot be overlooked. The economic opportunities it creates and the convenience of access to information about products and services illustrate its role as a catalyst for development. However, it is vital for advertisers to maintain ethical considerations and promote responsible consumption. Balancing the need for effective marketing with societal well-being is crucial in reaping the benefits of advertising while minimizing its potential harms. Thus, a more thoughtful approach to advertising can allow society to harness its advantages while mitigating its downsides.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";The world of modern art is often marked by a striking disparity in financial compensation, where certain artists can command astronomical sums for their creations while many laborers put forth relentless effort yet earn a fraction of that income. This discrepancy raises significant ethical questions about fairness in the valuation of creative work versus manual labor. While some argue that the government should intervene to rectify this imbalance, I contend that such intervention may not be the most effective solution.Proponents of government involvement argue that it is the responsibility of the state to ensure equitable treatment for all workers, regardless of their field. They emphasize that artists who receive exorbitant sums for their pieces often do not reflect the hard work and dedication that many laborers impart over years of toil. This perspective suggests a need for a more equitable distribution of wealth within society, which could include support systems for struggling artists or financial regulations that cap earnings in the art sector.However, critics of this viewpoint argue that the arts, by their very nature, should not be subjected to the same economic standards as labor-intensive professions. The value of artwork is inherently subjective, determined by factors such as cultural significance, personal emotional impact, and societal trends. Artists may spend years honing their craft, and their creations, while sometimes ephemeral, frequently provoke thought and elicit deep resonance. Imposing regulations on artistic income could stifle creativity and entrepreneurial spirit, leading to a less vibrant cultural landscape.In conclusion, while the disparity in earnings between modern artists and laborers is undeniably concerning, government intervention may not provide the equitable solution it purports to offer. Instead, fostering a society that appreciates both forms of labor equally, while recognizing the unique challenges faced by each, may pave the way for a more balanced appreciation of the value within our economy.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";In the contemporary work environment, many individuals are increasingly putting in longer hours at their jobs, a trend that brings with it significant drawbacks not only for the workers themselves but also for their families and society at large. I firmly believe that working hours should be restricted to mitigate these negative impacts.First and foremost, extended working hours have been linked to numerous adverse health effects. Individuals who work long hours often experience chronic fatigue, stress, and burnout. This relentless pace can lead to neglect of physical health, as individuals become tired and unmotivated to engage in regular exercise or prepare healthy meals. The repercussions can be devastating, resulting in obesity, heart disease, and mental health disorders. Thus, restricting working hours could promote a healthier lifestyle, enabling individuals to prioritize their well-being.Furthermore, long hours at work can severely impact personal relationships. Employees exhaust themselves at the office, leaving little energy or time for family and social interactions. As a result, they can become isolated and unable to nurture essential relationships, leading to a breakdown in family dynamics. Over time, this obsession with work fosters a culture of workaholism, where individuals lose sight of their personal lives and the importance of leisure—ultimately diminishing their quality of life.Finally, the societal impacts of prolonged work hours are equally concerning. When individuals are overwhelmed by their jobs, they are less likely to engage in community activities, volunteerism, or even casual social interactions that enrich societal bonds. This disconnect can hinder social cohesion and the development of strong, supportive communities.In conclusion, the prevalence of longer working hours has detrimental effects on health, personal life, and societal engagement. By restricting working hours, we can encourage healthier lifestyles, strengthen family ties, and foster more vibrant communities. It is imperative that we acknowledge and address this issue to create a more balanced and fulfilling existence for all.
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;The notion that a successful person is solely defined by their financial wealth is a perspective that warrants critical examination. While it is undeniable that money plays a significant role in one's life, true success extends far beyond the confines of monetary gain. A truly successful individual is characterized by their achievements and contributions, which are often rooted in hard work, dedication, and passion.Achievements in life often encompass a broad spectrum, including personal growth, community impact, and professional milestones. For instance, a teacher who dedicates their life to educating and inspiring students may not accumulate vast wealth but impacts countless lives in meaningful ways. This influence can be a hallmark of success, showing that success is not solely linked to financial accolades. By shifting the focus from monetary success to personal and professional achievements, we recognize the multifaceted nature of human experience.Moreover, the avenues through which individuals earn money vary greatly. Some may achieve high income through controversial means, while others may struggle economically despite displaying incredible skill and integrity in their fields. The ethical implications surrounding wealth highlight that success is not merely about financial accumulation but also about the values that guide one’s actions. Ultimately, hard work and dedication are the bedrocks of any true success story. Passion-driven pursuits, whether in the arts, sciences, or social causes, often lead to profound personal fulfillment and societal contributions, transcending the superficiality of monetary wealth. In conclusion, I contend that while financial success is important and can provide certain comforts, it is the combination of achievements and the impact on others that truly defines a successful person.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;In today's consumer-driven society, the influence of advertising on purchasing decisions is undeniable. Advertising pervades our lives through various mediums such as television, billboards, and magazines, shaping our perceptions of necessity and desire. As a result, many argue that the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising rather than the true needs of society. While this viewpoint has merit, it is essential to consider the multifaceted nature of consumer behavior.It is indeed true that advertisements can manipulate emotions and perceptions, prompting consumers to purchase items that may not meet their essential needs. For example, the allure of a glamorous lifestyle portrayed in advertisements can lead individuals to buy luxury items, even if these products serve no practical purpose in their daily lives. Such marketing strategies are designed to create a false sense of urgency or necessity, particularly among impressionable demographics. This can lead to a culture of excess and waste, where individuals prioritize brand names over actual utility.However, it is overly simplistic to claim that advertising is the sole driver of consumer behavior. Buying habits are inherently personal, shaped by a variety of factors including individual needs, cultural influences, and financial situations. While advertising may raise awareness and influence initial interest, the final decision to purchase remains with the consumer. Many individuals evaluate their needs and resources prior to making a purchase, often prioritizing essentials over extravagance. In some cases, consumers are even empowered to make informed choices by accessing alternative information, such as product reviews or community feedback.In conclusion, while advertising undeniably plays a significant role in influencing consumer behavior, it is neither the sole nor the most substantial factor. Personal needs, economic circumstances, and societal values also significantly shape purchasing decisions. Thus, a balanced view recognizes both the power of advertising and the complexity of individual consumer behavior.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;In nearly every country, paying taxes is considered a fundamental obligation of citizenship. These contributions are crucial for funding essential public services, such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and social welfare programs. While it is undeniable that tax payments are a significant way for individuals to contribute to society, I argue that this is not sufficient on its own to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens. Individuals should recognize that their obligations extend beyond financial contributions. One of the most pressing responsibilities lies in supporting the less fortunate within the community. There are many impoverished or disabled people who, for various reasons, face challenges that prevent them from achieving a decent standard of living. It is the ethical duty of those who are more privileged to step up and provide assistance, whether through volunteering, mentorship, or direct support. Moreover, societal contribution also encompasses civic engagement, such as participating in local governance, advocating for social justice, and raising awareness about critical issues affecting the community. These roles help to foster a sense of solidarity and interconnectedness among citizens, which is essential for building a healthy and resilient society. Furthermore, taxes do not cover every societal need or concern. Issues like environmental sustainability, mental health awareness, and cultural enrichment often require additional efforts from individuals to create positive change. In conclusion, while paying taxes is a vital aspect of civic responsibility, it is not the sole duty of citizenship. Citizens should also engage in community support and actively participate in societal development initiatives. A holistic approach, combining financial contributions with active participation and compassion, ultimately leads to a more robust and cohesive society.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";The debate on the prioritization of academic subjects in schools emphasizes the necessity of preparing students for future careers. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that subjects such as mathematics, physics, and other core disciplines are essential for students' future success in the workforce. While it is undeniable that these subjects form the backbone of many professions, I would argue that focusing solely on academics overlooks several crucial aspects of a child's holistic development, particularly the importance of music, sports, and the arts. Music and sports education enhances creativity, teamwork, and discipline, qualities that are invaluable in any career. For instance, participation in sports teaches students the importance of collaboration and resilience. These traits are not only vital in personal growth but are also increasingly sought after by employers across various fields. Similarly, music education can foster creativity and critical thinking skills that are essential in problem-solving roles.Furthermore, subjects such as art and physical education contribute significantly to emotional well-being, providing an outlet for stress relief and self-expression. Emotional intelligence and mental health are often overlooked in traditional academic curriculums, yet they are critical for long-term success and happiness in any profession.While practical skills acquired through academic subjects are undeniably important, the life skills developed through music and sports education should not be underestimated. They equip students to face real-world challenges beyond mere job preparation. In conclusion, while academic subjects hold importance in shaping future career paths, a well-rounded education that includes music, sports, and the arts ultimately nurtures more versatile and emotionally intelligent individuals. Thus, schools should strive for a balance, promoting both academic excellence and the enriching experiences that come from diverse curricula.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The advent of the Internet has undoubtedly changed the landscape of media consumption, leading many to argue that traditional newspapers and magazines are on the verge of extinction. I concur with this viewpoint, as the pervasive use of internet-based media, coupled with changing consumer preferences, suggests that the era of print media is coming to an end.First and foremost, the convenience and immediacy offered by online news platforms cannot be overstated. In a fast-paced world, readers demand real-time information, a need that paper media cannot fulfill. For instance, breaking news is instantaneously updated on websites and social media, allowing consumers to access the latest developments at their fingertips. In contrast, newspapers are often outdated by the time they reach readers, limiting their relevance. Moreover, the environmental concerns surrounding paper production and waste have prompted a significant shift towards digital alternatives. Young readers, in particular, are increasingly environmentally conscious and prefer sustainable options, which favors digital news sources over paper. Consequently, the Internet serves not only as a more accessible medium but also as a more ecologically responsible one.Additionally, the growing prevalence of mobile devices adds to the decline of traditional media. Smartphones and tablets grant users the ability to read news, essays, and other articles anywhere and anytime, eliminating the physical burden of carrying newspapers or magazines. Subscriptions for digital content often come at a fraction of the cost of print, making it economically advantageous for consumers.However, it is important to acknowledge that some individuals still appreciate the tactile experience of holding a print publication. Nonetheless, the shift in consumer behavior towards digital platforms appears irreversible. While traditional newspapers and magazines may maintain a niche audience for the foreseeable future, the realities of a digital world suggest that they will eventually become relics of the past. Thus, I firmly believe that as technology continues to evolve, the era of paper media will inevitably come to an end.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;When choosing a job, it is often argued that salary stands out as the most crucial consideration. In many societies, the size of the salary offered significantly influences individuals' job choices, as financial stability is essential for personal and familial well-being. However, I contend that while salary is an important factor, it is not the sole determinant of job satisfaction and overall happiness.First and foremost, a well-paying job may not guarantee fulfillment or contentment in one’s professional life. Other aspects, such as workplace relationships, environment, and job conditions, hold equal, if not greater, importance. For instance, working in a supportive atmosphere with friendly colleagues can mitigate the stress associated with demanding tasks. Positive interactions foster teamwork, leading to enhanced collaboration and productivity, ultimately contributing to an individual’s sense of belonging and satisfaction. Moreover, the physical conditions of a workplace, including its safety, cleanliness, and resources, are instrumental in determining an employee’s quality of life. A pleasant, inspiring work environment can increase motivation and creativity, allowing employees to thrive both personally and professionally. Conversely, a toxic work culture, despite offering a high salary, can lead to burnout, anxiety, and dissatisfaction. Furthermore, job roles that provide opportunities for personal growth and skill development often outweigh financial incentives in the long run. Positions that challenge individuals and promote learning can lead to greater job satisfaction and career advancement, although they may not offer the highest initial salaries.In conclusion, while salary undeniably plays a crucial role in job selection, it should not overshadow other significant factors such as workplace culture, environment, and personal growth opportunities. A harmonious balance among these elements is essential for achieving true happiness and quality of life in one’s career.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;In today’s fast-paced world, computers have become an essential part of everyday life, significantly impacting various aspects of personal and educational development. While there are concerns regarding the potential negative effects of daily computer use on children, I firmly disagree with the notion that these effects outweigh the benefits. When utilized wisely, computers can serve as powerful tools in enhancing children's learning experiences and skills.One of the primary advantages of daily computer use is the access it provides to vast resources available on the internet. Children can explore a wealth of information on almost any subject imaginable, which fosters curiosity and promotes lifelong learning. Educational platforms, online courses, and interactive websites enable children to delve into topics that interest them, supplementing traditional classroom learning. This dynamic approach cultivates critical thinking and encourages self-directed learning.Additionally, computers facilitate collaboration and communication among peers. Children can engage in group projects, share ideas, and collaborate on assignments through various online platforms. This not only enhances their understanding of teamwork but also prepares them for a technologically-driven future where digital communication is paramount.Moreover, the use of computers can aid in developing essential skills such as coding, graphic design, and data analysis. As society becomes increasingly reliant on technology, equipping children with these skills can greatly enhance their employability and adaptability in an ever-evolving job market.Lastly, with the appropriate guidance from parents and educators, the risks associated with excessive screen time—such as exposure to inappropriate content or sedentary behavior—can be mitigated. By instilling healthy habits and setting boundaries, the negative implications can be significantly reduced, allowing children to reap the myriad benefits of daily computer use.In conclusion, the positive impacts of daily computer use on children far outweigh the potential negatives, as it not only broadens their knowledge and skills but also prepares them for a successful future in an increasingly digital world.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;"The assertion that children raised in financially disadvantaged families are better equipped to tackle the challenges of adulthood than their wealthier counterparts is a contentious one. While some argue that the adversity faced by children in less affluent environments fosters resilience and resourcefulness, I firmly disagree with this perspective. In my view, socioeconomic status significantly influences the opportunities available to children, shaping their readiness for adult life.Firstly, children from poorer families often encounter numerous obstacles that can lead to maladaptive behaviors. Economic hardship can push individuals toward crime, thievery, or involvement in gangs as a means of survival. The struggle to meet basic needs may prompt them to prioritize short-term gains over long-term planning, which is critical in navigating adult responsibilities. This negative association can hinder their ability to develop constructive habits necessary for success in life.Moreover, access to quality education is frequently limited for children from low-income families. Educational opportunities directly correlate with future prospects; without a solid foundation in education, children may find themselves ill-prepared to meet the demands of the workforce or higher education. In contrast, wealthier families can provide their children with access to private schooling, extracurricular activities, and resources that foster critical thinking and problem-solving skills essential for adult life.In conclusion, while resilience is undoubtedly an asset in adulthood, it is not sufficient in isolation. Financial hardship may teach some children the importance of perseverance; however, the myriad challenges they face can ultimately undermine their personal and professional development. Wealthier families can afford to equip their children with the tools, education, and support systems necessary to thrive in the complexities of adult life. Thus, I contend that children raised in affluent households are better prepared to navigate adult challenges effectively."
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;"In recent years, the prevalence of health problems among modern populations has surged, prompting discussions about the root causes of these ailments. Many argue that the sedentary lifestyle characteristic of today's society plays a crucial role in the deterioration of public health. While there is truth to this claim, I believe other factors contribute even more significantly to our contemporary medical challenges.Undeniably, the shift towards a sedentary lifestyle has had a profound impact on health. With the advent of technology and the rise of office-based jobs, individuals are spending more time sitting and less time engaging in physical activity. This lifestyle has been linked to various health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Moreover, prolonged sitting has been associated with adverse effects on mental health, including increased anxiety and depression, contributing to a cycle of health decline.However, it is essential to recognize that various other factors also influence modern health problems. Nutrition plays a pivotal role; the rise of processed foods and the prevalence of unhealthy eating habits can lead to significant health issues, including metabolic syndrome and dietary deficiencies. Furthermore, environmental factors cannot be overlooked. Pollution, exposure to chemicals, and stressors in our urban environments contribute considerably to health problems that extend beyond sedentary behavior.Moreover, access to healthcare and socioeconomic factors also influence health outcomes. Individuals in deprived areas often face barriers to receiving adequate medical care, which exacerbates health issues. Therefore, while a sedentary lifestyle is a significant contributor to the rise in health problems, it is not the sole cause. Other aspects, including dietary choices, environmental hazards, and socioeconomic conditions, must be addressed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the health challenges faced by modern populations. In conclusion, while the sedentary lifestyle merits attention for its role in health decline, it is essential to consider the multifaceted nature of health issues in today's world. A holistic approach addressing all contributing factors is vital for improving public health outcomes."
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";The debate over the appropriate age to begin foreign language instruction has garnered significant attention among educators and parents alike. Some advocate for initiating this learning process in preschool, arguing that young children possess an innate ability to absorb new languages. Conversely, others contend that language acquisition is better suited for later years when children can focus on grammar and structure more effectively. I firmly believe that introducing foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is not only beneficial but crucial in today’s interconnected world.Beginning foreign language instruction in kindergarten taps into the natural propensity of young children to learn languages. Research supports the idea that the earlier children are exposed to a new language, the more adept they will be at acquiring it. At this age, children engage in play-based learning, making it easier to incorporate language lessons within enjoyable activities. This playful approach can significantly enhance their vocabulary, pronunciation, and overall fluency, laying a strong foundation for future language skills.Moreover, early language acquisition goes beyond mere vocabulary. It fosters cognitive development, enhances problem-solving abilities, and promotes cultural awareness. In an increasingly globalized society, children who learn a second language from a young age are better equipped to navigate diverse cultures and communicate effectively in various social contexts. Furthermore, studies indicate that bilingualism can lead to improved performance in other academic areas, demonstrating that learning a foreign language can contribute positively to overall educational outcomes.In conclusion, the advantages of starting foreign language instruction in kindergarten are compelling. Not only does it optimize the natural learning capabilities of young children, but it also equips them with essential skills for the future. Therefore, I advocate for the inclusion of foreign language programs in early childhood education to prepare children for the demands of a multilingual and multicultural world.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;International tourism has experienced a remarkable boom over the last few decades, transforming it into a colossal industry worldwide. As countries seek to attract visitors, the economic benefits often touted include job creation, infrastructure development, and increased foreign exchange earnings. Nevertheless, a persistent debate has emerged around the potential negative consequences of this growth, with some arguing that the problems of international tourism outweigh its benefits.Critics of international tourism highlight several significant issues. Environmental degradation often accompanies mass tourism, with natural landscapes, wildlife habitats, and ecosystems suffering from overuse and pollution. Local cultures may also face dilution as tourism commercializes traditional practices and lifestyles to cater to visitors' expectations instead of preserving their authentic heritage. Additionally, the influx of tourists can result in overcrowding, straining public services and infrastructure while pushing up costs of living for local residents.Conversely, proponents argue that the economic advantages of tourism are substantial. A well-managed tourism sector can provide a considerable boost to the local economy by creating jobs in hospitality, transportation, and retail. Furthermore, the revenue generated from international tourists can fund public services, cultural preservation initiatives, and environmental conservation efforts. For many developing nations, tourism serves as a vital driver of economic growth, reducing poverty and enhancing the overall quality of life for inhabitants.In conclusion, while it is undeniable that international tourism brings challenges, it is essential to recognize the significant benefits it can provide. By establishing sustainable tourism practices and balancing the interests of tourists and local communities, the industry can continue to thrive, enhancing economic prospects while mitigating adverse impacts. Therefore, while I acknowledge the problems associated with international tourism, I believe that with mindful management, the benefits can indeed outweigh the drawbacks.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;The assertion that children should regularly watch TV in school and at home to enhance their learning efficiency is a contentious one. While there is no denying that certain educational programs can provide valuable information and teaching techniques, the passive nature of TV viewing undermines the importance of active engagement in the learning process.Watching TV is fundamentally a passive action. When children are absorbed in a screen, they are often mere spectators rather than active participants in their own learning. This passivity can lead to reduced attention spans, less critical thinking, and a decreased ability to engage with material on a deeper level. Instead of encouraging creativity and interactive thought, excessive TV viewing risks creating a generation of learners who may struggle to think independently or innovatively.On the other hand, children who partake in activities that foster creativity, cooperation, and competition tend to demonstrate significantly better performance. Engaging in hands-on projects, collaborative group work, or even competitive games challenges children to think critically, work as a team, and develop problem-solving strategies. These experiences not only foster cognitive growth but also contribute to essential life skills, such as communication and emotional intelligence. In conclusion, while TV can serve as a supplementary educational tool when used judiciously, it should not replace more active methods of learning. Encouraging regular TV watching, especially in school, fails to promote the cognitive engagement necessary for holistic development. Instead, educators and parents should prioritize activities that stimulate creativity and collaboration to ensure children thrive academically and socially. Thus, I disagree with the notion that children should engage in regular TV viewing as a primary method of learning.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;The rise of the internet has transformed traditional work and study environments, allowing individuals to perform their tasks from the comfort of their homes. While some individuals praise the flexibility and convenience this arrangement offers, others argue that it has significant drawbacks. Analyzing both sides reveals a complex interplay of advantages and disadvantages.Proponents of remote work and study highlight several benefits. For instance, individuals save time and money by eliminating commutes, which can lead to increased productivity and a better work-life balance. Moreover, the ability to create a personalized work environment can enhance comfort and satisfaction. Additionally, remote setups can facilitate a wider talent pool for employers, as geographical barriers dissolve. Conversely, critics of this approach emphasize the potential negatives. They argue that working or studying in isolation can lead to feelings of disconnection and loneliness, which may impair motivation and creativity. Employers report that employees often spend excessive time communicating via phone or email, which can hinder their productivity and decrease the quality of collaboration. The lack of face-to-face interaction can lead to misunderstandings and delays, impacting deliverables. Furthermore, educators express concerns for students learning remotely. Without immediate access to teachers for clarification, students may struggle with understanding complex subjects, which can lead to gaps in knowledge. The absence of a structured classroom environment also diminishes opportunities for collaborative learning, an essential aspect of education.In my opinion, while remote work and study offer valuable advantages like flexibility and cost savings, the disadvantages, particularly concerning communication and isolation, suggest that these methods may not be suitable for everyone. Striking a balance between remote and traditional environments could provide an optimal solution, allowing individuals to benefit from the best of both worlds.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;International tourism has transformed into the world's largest industry, fueling global economies and facilitating cultural exchanges. However, the effects of this surge in tourism are multifaceted, prompting a lively debate about its impact on intercultural relations. While some argue that tourism breeds tension among diverse cultures, I contend that it also fosters greater understanding and appreciation, particularly after conflicts arise.One cannot ignore that international tourism can lead to misunderstandings and friction. Visitors may inadvertently offend local customs or traditions due to cultural insensitivity, creating tension between tourists and host communities. Issues such as overcrowding, environmental degradation, and commercial exploitation can also alienate local populations, exacerbating frustrations. However, such conflicts often serve as a catalyst for dialogue and mutual understanding. When people from different cultures engage in spirited discussions, they are compelled to explain their perspectives and seek common ground.Moreover, tourism encourages curiosity and openness. As individuals explore new cultures, they often leave their preconceived notions behind, leading to richer interactions. Many travelers are eager to learn about the histories, beliefs, and lifestyles that differ from their own. This willingness to understand can result in friendships that transcend borders and strengthen international ties.Additionally, the coexistence of tourists and locals can promote an exchange of ideas and values. While there may be occasional conflicts stemming from cultural differences, the underlying intention among many tourists is to connect with new cultures. This pursuit can foster a deeper understanding that extends beyond superficial interactions, benefiting both visitors and hosts.In conclusion, while international tourism can lead to tension between cultures, it also provides invaluable opportunities for dialogue and understanding. The conflicts that arise can prompt constructive conversations, ultimately enriching the mutual appreciation of diverse cultures. Therefore, I believe that the overall impact of international tourism leans more towards fostering understanding than fostering division.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;In contemporary society, it is widely perceived that celebrities are increasingly renowned for their glamorous lifestyles and immense wealth rather than their actual achievements. This phenomenon comes with significant implications, particularly for the impressionable youth who often idolize these public figures. While it is true that many celebrities flaunt their opulence and prioritize image over substance, it would be reductive to claim that all celebrities set a poor example.On one hand, numerous celebrities capitalize on their fame by showcasing lavish lifestyles—exotic vacations, designer clothing, and extravagant parties. Reality television and social media platforms often amplify this trend, creating a culture where followers equate success with material wealth. This can negatively influence young people, leading them to prioritize ephemeral values over intrinsic qualities such as hard work, resilience, and dedication. When youth see celebrities as paragons of success merely due to their glamour, it can undermine their understanding of genuine achievement.Conversely, there are numerous celebrities who utilize their platforms for positive influence and social change. Figures such as Malala Yousafzai and Leonardo DiCaprio advocate for education and environmental issues, respectively, inspiring young people to pursue meaningful goals. These individuals leverage their fame to champion important causes, promoting values of responsibility, activism, and contribution to society, which can have a profoundly positive impact.In conclusion, while the trend of celebrities being celebrated for glamour and wealth is evident and concerning, it is crucial to recognize that not all public figures conform to this stereotype. There exist many who serve as role models, inspiring young people to channel their ambitions into worthwhile pursuits. Ultimately, it is imperative for youth to discern between superficial fame and genuine achievement, drawing inspiration from those who positively influence their communities and the world at large.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;The debate surrounding children's television consumption is multifaceted, with valid points on both sides. On one hand, television serves as an immense source of information, providing access to educational programs that can aid in learning. Children can acquire knowledge about diverse subjects, such as science, history, and culture, often in an engaging and visually stimulating format that textbooks may fail to replicate. Additionally, age-appropriate programs can enhance language skills, social awareness, and critical thinking by exposing children to new vocabulary and diverse perspectives.However, despite these benefits, I argue that allowing children to watch television both at home and school can adversely impact their overall growth. While limited screen time can be constructive, excessive exposure to television can lead to detrimental consequences, such as decreased physical activity and reduced interaction with peers. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children aged 2 to 5 should have no more than one hour of high-quality programming each day. Overindulgence in screen time can also result in sleep disruptions, attention problems, and impaired academic performance, as it may displace time spent on homework, reading, and other vital learning opportunities.Moreover, not all television content is created equal. While there are educational shows, many programs are purely entertainment-driven and can promote unhealthy behaviors or unrealistic expectations. By integrating television as a primary learning tool in schools, the risk arises that children may not engage in more meaningful, hands-on educational experiences, which are essential for holistic development.In conclusion, while television can be a valuable educational resource, it should be approached with caution. Encouraging an environment that emphasizes a balanced approach to learning, integrating television as a supplementary resource rather than a focal point, is essential for fostering a child's comprehensive growth and development.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;The assertion that workers over 50 lack responsiveness to the rapidly changing ideas of the modern workplace and should consequently be replaced by younger workers is a sweeping generalization that merits scrutiny. At first glance, it may appear that older employees are resistant to change due to their entrenched mindsets and preference for monotony. However, such a perspective overlooks the multifaceted value that older workers bring to an organization.Indeed, older workers may sometimes hold to traditional paradigms, which can be perceived as a reluctance to embrace innovation. Their adherence to established practices can stem from a deep-seated desire for stability, a trait cultivated over decades of experience. While it is true that younger workers often exhibit greater flexibility and are more attuned to the fast-paced evolution of technology, it would be simplistic to categorize older employees as incapable of adapting. One of the pivotal advantages younger workers possess is their familiarity with cutting-edge technology and contemporary methodologies. In a world where knowledge is constantly evolving, younger workers are often more adept at learning new systems and integrating novel ideas into their workflows. However, this does not automatically render older workers obsolete. In fact, the juxtaposition of experience and fresh perspectives can lead to a harmonious and effective workplace dynamic.Moreover, older employees have an extensive reservoir of knowledge that can greatly benefit organizations. Their years of experience gleaned from various challenges position them as invaluable mentors to younger workers, creating a learning environment that fosters growth on both sides. The potential synergy between older and younger employees should be embraced rather than dismissed.In conclusion, while there are aspects of truth in the claim regarding older workers' unresponsiveness, it is crucial to recognize their unique strengths and contributions. A diverse workforce, encompassing both the vivacity of youth and the wisdom of experience, often proves to be the most responsive and successful in adapting to the complexities of the modern workplace.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The increasing use of machines in various sectors of society has sparked a heated debate about their impact on human health and labor. While some argue that machines reduce physical work and, consequently, can be detrimental to our health, others believe that these advancements not only ease workload but also save time in performing tasks. This essay will explore both sides of the coin to determine whether the advantages truly outweigh the disadvantages.Critics of machine usage often point out that reliance on technology diminishes physical activity, leading to sedentary lifestyles. Instead of engaging in manual labor, which historically kept humans active, people now often find themselves confined to offices or sitting for long periods while machines do the work. This trend has been linked to rising obesity rates and associated health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes, as fewer individuals engage in regular physical activity. Moreover, there are concerns about mental health, as a reduction in physical labor may result in feelings of disengagement and a lack of satisfaction in one's work.On the contrary, proponents argue that machines significantly enhance productivity and efficiency. Tasks that once took hours can now be completed in a fraction of the time, allowing individuals and businesses to achieve higher output levels. This swift execution not only frees up time for humans to pursue other interests or activities but can also lead to economic growth and improved living standards. In sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, and logistics, machines can perform dangerous tasks, thus mitigating injury risks for workers.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the negative health implications of reduced physical activity due to machine reliance, the advantages of improved efficiency and productivity are compelling. Ultimately, it seems that the benefits of using machines in our daily lives and workplaces outweigh the associated disadvantages, provided that we remain conscious of our health and actively seek to incorporate physical activity into our routines.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;The notion that technological development inevitably leads to the demise of traditional skills and ways of life is a contentious one. While some proponents argue for the elimination of conventional practices in favor of modernization, I strongly disagree with this perspective. Traditional skills and cultural practices are invaluable aspects of a society that contribute to its identity and diversity.Firstly, traditional skills are intrinsic to the cultural heritage of a country. They represent a unique historical narrative that defines a community's character. Each country possesses its own distinct customs, crafts, and culinary practices that have been passed down through generations. For instance, traditional textile weaving in India or pottery in Mexico not only provide economic opportunities but also preserve unique artistic expressions. These elements foster a sense of pride among citizens, who find solace and meaning in their cultural roots. When societies prioritize technological advancement at the expense of their traditions, they risk losing their distinctiveness and the rich tapestry of diversity that defines our global community.Moreover, traditional skills can coexist with technological advancements, enhancing rather than erasing contemporary culture. Innovations can sometimes incorporate traditional methods, leading to new forms of art and craftsmanship that respect the past while embracing the future. For example, the fusion of traditional cooking techniques with modern culinary practices has led to new gastronomic experiences worldwide. By blending the old with the new, countries can create a vibrant cultural landscape that honors both heritage and progress.In conclusion, the preservation of traditional skills and ways of life is not only vital for cultural identity but also complements technological growth. Eliminating these practices in the name of modernization is a shortsighted approach that undermines the richness and diversity of human experience. It is essential to strike a balance, appreciating innovation while valuing the traditions that shape who we are.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;In the contemporary urban landscape, the escalating problem of traffic congestion has garnered significant attention, particularly in large cities, often referred to as melting pots due to their diverse populations and economic activities. The assertion that reducing the need for travel from home for work, education, and shopping is the only solution to alleviate traffic has its merits, yet it also requires a broader perspective.First and foremost, the primary driver of traffic overload in big cities is overpopulation. As cities continue to burgeon, the influx of residents increases the demand for commuting. City planners are confronted with the challenge of managing this dense population efficiently. One viable approach is to encourage non-personal vehicle transportation, such as public transit systems, cycling, and walking. Enhancing the accessibility and reliability of these alternatives can drastically reduce the number of individual vehicles on the road, thereby mitigating traffic congestion.Moreover, leveraging suburban areas for work and shopping can further address traffic woes. By developing satellite offices and businesses in suburban regions, cities can distribute both the population and the workforce more evenly. This approach not only alleviates pressure on urban centers but also fosters the local economies of less densely populated areas. However, while reducing the need for travel is a valid strategy, it is not the only solution. A multifaceted approach that includes improving public transportation, creating pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and promoting remote work and e-commerce will likely yield more sustainable results. By simultaneously addressing these various factors, cities can enhance mobility, reduce traffic, and improve overall quality of life.In conclusion, although minimizing the necessity for travel plays a crucial role in traffic reduction, a comprehensive strategy that integrates multiple solutions is essential for effective urban planning. The collaborative effort of innovative city planners, community stakeholders, and citizens themselves is vital for creating a more sustainable urban environment.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;In today's digital age, celebrities often wield tremendous influence over young people worldwide through various media platforms. While they are typically celebrated for their glamour and wealth, the implications of idolizing these figures can be detrimental to youth. I firmly agree that following celebrities can pose significant risks to the younger generation, particularly in terms of their health and personality development.Firstly, the pursuit of the unattainable standards often set by celebrities can severely impact young people's health. Many celebrities portray an idealized image that emphasizes perfection, which can lead to unhealthy behavior among impressionable youth. This relentless quest for an unrealistic body image can result in eating disorders, stress, and mental health issues. For instance, the proliferation of social media allows young people to constantly compare themselves to celebrities' curated lives, fostering dissatisfaction and low self-esteem. Such toxic comparisons can divert focus from personal growth and well-being, pushing youth towards harmful lifestyle choices in a bid to emulate their idols.Moreover, the personality development of young individuals can also be adversely affected by celebrity culture. Many celebrities embody traits such as narcissism, entitlement, and superficiality—qualities that may be inadvertently adopted by their young fans. By idolizing such personas, youth may prioritize material wealth and social status over deeper values such as kindness, intelligence, and resilience. This shift in focus can hinder their ability to develop meaningful relationships and make well-rounded life choices.In conclusion, while celebrities can inspire through their achievements, the overwhelming emphasis on their glamorous lives and wealth is problematic. Young people are highly impressionable and can suffer health-related issues and personality distortions as they try to mimic their idols. Therefore, it is essential for both parents and educators to steer youth towards more positive role models who promote holistic values and achievements rather than a superficial lifestyle.
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;The debate over gender equality in education has been prominent for many years, especially regarding the admission of equal numbers of male and female students in various subjects. While the goal of achieving equal representation resonates with many, the implementation of rigid quotas may not be the most effective approach to fostering a truly equitable educational environment.Proponents argue that ensuring equal gender representation is essential for dismantling long-standing societal barriers that have historically marginalized women, particularly in fields such as science, engineering, and technology. Many institutions are now striving to maintain a balanced admission ratio, and notable progress has been made over the years. The rising proportion of female students in these traditionally male-dominated areas signifies a positive shift, indicating that the barriers are weakening, albeit gradually. Efforts to attract female students through targeted outreach and support programs have yielded encouraging results.However, imposing equal quotas may inadvertently undermine the meritocratic principles of education. Admissions should prioritize qualifications, experiences, and potential contributions, rather than focusing solely on gender as a determining criterion. This approach risks pigeonholing students into specific roles based on their gender rather than allowing them the freedom to choose their academic paths based on interest and capability. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that the gender imbalance in certain fields may reflect broader societal trends and personal choices rather than outright discrimination. Encouraging women to enter specific areas through mentorship and role models could prove more beneficial than enforcing quotas.In conclusion, while striving for equal representation in universities is important, implementing equal numbers of male and female students in every subject may not be the most effective method. A balanced approach that promotes equality while respecting individual aspirations and capabilities is essential for fostering a more inclusive and effective educational environment.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;Smoking has long been recognized as a toxic habit that endangers not only the smoker but also those who are exposed to secondhand smoke. As research has consistently demonstrated, smoking is responsible for numerous health issues, including cancer, respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular problems. The World Health Organization has also classified tobacco use as one of the leading preventable causes of death globally. As such, many have designated smoking as a shameful practice that should be curbed to protect public health. I strongly agree that smoking should be prohibited in all public places, with exceptions only for designated smoking areas.In many countries, the dangers of smoking have prompted legislative action to restrict its use in public venues. For instance, laws that ban smoking in restaurants, schools, and public transportation systems aim to create healthier environments for everyone. Such measures are essential, particularly in areas with high foot traffic, like bus and railway stations. These locations are not only frequented by smokers but also by children, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. The adverse effects of passive smoking, or secondhand smoke exposure, are well-documented, as it can lead to severe health consequences for those who are vulnerable. By enforcing stricter regulations on smoking in these areas, governments can significantly reduce the risks and promote a culture of health and well-being.Furthermore, the normalization of smoking in public spaces perpetuates its acceptability and can encourage new smokers, particularly among the youth. Making smoking illegal in public places sends a powerful message that this habit is not just detrimental to the individual but also to society as a whole. In conclusion, aligning global policies to prohibit smoking in all public spaces, with limited exceptions, would contribute to a healthier population and foster a stigma against this lethal habit.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;The assertion that tourism constitutes a modern form of colonialism is a complex and nuanced debate. Proponents of this view argue that tourism distorts local economies, leads to environmental degradation, and inflicts irreparable harm on the locations it exploits. Indeed, communities often change dramatically in response to tourism, prioritizing the needs of visitors over those of residents, which can disrupt local cultures and economic structures. For instance, in many popular tourist destinations, local artisans and vendors may find themselves pushed aside by large multinational corporations that cater to tourists, often resulting in a loss of cultural authenticity and economic agency.Moreover, the environmental impact of tourism cannot be understated. The influx of tourists often leads to overexploitation of natural resources, pollution, and other forms of environmental degradation. Iconic sites, from the Great Barrier Reef to the beaches of Bali, face threats from excessive visitor numbers. Ecosystems struggle to cope with the constant foot traffic and waste produced by millions of visitors each year.However, I assert that tourism does not have to be inherently exploitative or destructive. By integrating education and a focus on sustainability into the tourism experience, a harmonious relationship between humans and their surroundings can be cultivated. Eco-tourism and responsible travel practices can foster a deeper appreciation for local cultures and the environment while promoting economic benefits for residents. Education plays a crucial role here, as it can encourage tourists to engage with the local community in meaningful ways, thereby supporting local economies and conservation efforts.In conclusion, while tourism has the potential to mimic colonial practices by exploiting local resources and cultures, it is essential to recognize that it can also be a force for good if approached thoughtfully. Encouraging sustainable practices and education can transform tourism into a beneficial exchange, one that respects and preserves the integrity of the places it touches.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;In the last two decades, the field of information technology (IT) has undergone remarkable transformations that have significantly enhanced our standard of living and work efficiency. The emergence of the World Wide Web and the proliferation of email have streamlined communication, making it instant and accessible across the globe. Businesses can now operate in real-time, fostering global collaborations and innovations that were once unfathomable. Additionally, IT has transformed education, making a wealth of information available at our fingertips and allowing remote learning to flourish.However, alongside these advancements, it is increasingly believed that future developments in IT may yield more negative effects than positive. One stark concern is the growing dependence on technology, which has led to the phenomenon of individuals becoming slaves to their devices. This reliance on technology can result in a deteriorating sense of community and interpersonal relationships as face-to-face interactions are replaced by digital conversations. Moreover, the constant connectivity fostered by mobile devices and social media often leads to work-life imbalance, with individuals feeling pressured to respond to work notifications outside of office hours, ultimately eroding personal time and mental health.Additionally, the evolution of IT raises significant concerns about privacy and data security. As we share more information online, the risks of cybercrime and data breaches have intensified, casting a shadow over the conveniences that technology provides. The rise of artificial intelligence and automation threatens employment opportunities, leaving many workers vulnerable in an ever-evolving job landscape.In conclusion, while IT has undeniably improved our quality of life and work productivity over the past 20 years, the potential negative repercussions warrant serious consideration. The challenge lies in harnessing IT's capabilities without becoming overly reliant on its numerous facets, ensuring that technology serves humanity rather than enslaves it.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the number of individuals adopting vegetarianism, prompting discussions about the motivations behind this dietary shift. While many attribute this phenomenon primarily to concerns over animal rights, there is a strong case to be made that a multitude of factors are influencing people to embrace a vegetarian lifestyle.One of the primary reasons for this growing trend is health improvement. Numerous studies have suggested that vegetarian diets can lead to lower risks of chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. This scientific evidence has resonated with many, encouraging them to prioritize their well-being through dietary changes. The increasing awareness of the adverse effects of red and processed meats on health, combined with the abundance of information about the benefits of a plant-based diet, has undeniably played a crucial role in this movement. Additionally, many people have reported improved energy levels, better digestion, and enhanced overall vitality after switching to vegetarianism.Religious beliefs also contribute significantly to the decision to adopt a vegetarian diet. Various faiths advocate for the principles of non-violence and compassion towards all living beings, leading adherents to choose plant-based diets. For instance, Hinduism and Buddhism both emphasize the importance of ahimsa, or non-harm, which often translates into vegetarian practices among followers. Such religious principles reinforce the ethical motivations for abstaining from meat, creating a deep-seated cultural and spiritual connection to vegetarianism.In conclusion, while animal rights issues are undoubtedly a factor in people's decision to adopt vegetarianism, health benefits and religious beliefs are equally significant contributors. The ongoing rise in vegetarianism reflects a broader trend toward mindful eating, where individuals seek to align their dietary choices with their concerns for their health and ethical convictions.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;"The rapid advancement of technology in various countries undoubtedly brings about modern skills and lifestyle changes that influence traditional ways of life. However, I believe that the evolution of technology does not necessarily equate to the extinction of traditional skills and practices; rather, it leads to a transformation in their roles within society.Firstly, traditional skills and ways of life often carry intrinsic cultural value. They represent a community's history, identity, and social fabric. The introduction of advanced technology can foster a renewed appreciation for these traditions, as they may be adapted rather than abandoned. For example, artisans may incorporate modern techniques into their craftsmanship, enhancing their products and ensuring their relevance in a contemporary marketplace. This synergy allows for the preservation of traditional knowledge while simultaneously embracing the advantages brought by new technologies.Moreover, the integration of technology and tradition can yield innovative solutions to contemporary challenges. In agriculture, for instance, traditional farming practices can be combined with modern techniques such as precision farming, creating sustainable farming methods that honor ancestral wisdom. This combination can lead to improved productivity without compromising the cultural significance of traditional practices.However, it is essential to recognize the potential risk of losing traditional skills if societies lean too heavily on technology. As convenience becomes a priority, younger generations may opt for modern methods over traditional ones. This highlights the need for intentional efforts to educate and instill cultural appreciation in future generations, ensuring that traditional skills remain a valued part of society’s fabric.In conclusion, while technological development indeed alters lifestyles and introduces new skills, it is not necessarily futile to strive for the preservation of traditional practices. Instead of viewing technology and tradition as opposing forces, we should explore their potential to coexist and enrich each other, thereby safeguarding cultural heritage while embracing modernization."
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;In contemporary society, the purpose of zoos has often come under scrutiny, leading many to question whether they serve any useful function. However, I strongly disagree with the assertion that zoos have no valuable purpose. Instead, I argue that they play a critical role in education, scientific research, and conservation, all of which are increasingly vital in today’s rapidly changing world.Firstly, zoos serve as exceptional educational platforms. They offer learners of all ages the opportunity to observe a variety of animal species up close, providing real and vivid materials that textbooks alone cannot deliver. This experiential learning fosters a deeper understanding of biodiversity and ecosystems, igniting a passion for wildlife conservation in young minds. For instance, school groups visiting the local zoo often engage in interactive programs, enriching their knowledge about animal behavior, habitats, and the importance of conservation efforts.Furthermore, for university students pursuing biology and related fields, zoos provide invaluable resources for practical research. Students can conduct studies based on live animal behaviors and physiological responses, collecting data that would be impossible to gather in the wild due to restrictions and logistical challenges. The availability of live recordings and practical statistics allows students to develop a more robust understanding of animal life, ultimately preparing them for future careers in conservation and biology.Importantly, as globalization progresses, natural habitats are continuously encroached upon, leading to a decline in wildlife populations across the globe. Zoos have evolved into sanctuaries for endangered species, playing a crucial role in breeding programs aimed at reintroducing animals into their natural habitats. By participating in global conservation efforts, zoos contribute meaningfully to the preservation of biodiversity.In conclusion, I believe that zoos offer several essential benefits. They serve as educational resources, provide opportunities for practical biological research, and play a crucial part in wildlife conservation amidst ongoing environmental threats. Thus, rather than dismissing zoos as unnecessary, it is crucial to recognize and support their multifaceted roles in our society.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";"The extinction of several minority languages poses a significant cultural loss, raising the debate on whether public funds should be allocated to their preservation. Proponents of funding argue that these languages represent invaluable cultural heritage, carrying with them traditions, worldviews, and histories that could otherwise be lost forever. Their extinction not only diminishes human diversity but also undermines the richness of global culture. For instance, indigenous languages often encapsulate unique ecological knowledge and cultural practices that are not present in dominant languages. As such, the preservation of these languages may contribute to the safeguarding of cultural identity and heritage.Conversely, opponents contend that investing public money in dying languages may be a misuse of resources, particularly when such funds could be directed toward more pressing social issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. They argue that in our rapidly globalizing world, focus should shift toward teaching more widely spoken languages that foster international communication and economic opportunities. This viewpoint posits that the financial and educational resources needed for these languages could better serve the broader population.Despite these arguments, I firmly believe that governments should prioritize the preservation of minority languages. The formation of a language is not an arbitrary process; it is the result of thousands of years of evolution, community bonding, and shared experiences. Each language tells the story of its people, encapsulating their unique cultural heritage. By allowing these languages to fade into oblivion, we not only erase their history but also sever the connections that shape diverse identities across the globe. Therefore, protecting and promoting minority languages is essential not just for those who speak them, but for humanity as a whole, as they enrich our collective cultural tapestry. Emphasizing the value of linguistic diversity ultimately promotes a more inclusive and understanding world."
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";"The assertion that a significant portion of a country's health budget should transition from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures resonates strongly with the age-old adage, ""prevention is better than cure."" This principle underscores the importance of addressing potential health issues before they escalate into serious conditions that tax healthcare systems and drain public resources.Investing in health education and preventative measures not only promotes individual well-being but also yields considerable economic benefits. For instance, preemptively addressing chronic diseases—such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity—can substantially reduce long-term healthcare costs. A focus on prevention diminishes the necessity for expensive treatments and hospitalizations, contributing to a more efficient allocation of resources within the health budget. Ultimately, a healthier population results in increased productivity, reducing the economic burden associated with long-term illness.Furthermore, the role of education in cultivating a healthier society cannot be overstated. Schools should proactively teach children about balanced diets and the importance of nutritious foods while highlighting the dangers of consuming harmful food. By instilling these practices at a young age, we prepare future generations to make informed decisions about their health. Such education can lead to sustained lifestyle choices that help combat prevalent health issues, thereby reducing the need for intensive medical interventions later in life.However, it is necessary to acknowledge that while treatment remains an integral part of healthcare, fostering a preventive health culture can substantially decrease the instances of medical conditions that require intensive treatment. Therefore, although the continuation of medical treatment is vital, the balance within budgeting should shift towards prevention and health education.In conclusion, a strategic reallocation of health budget resources towards preventative measures and health education presents a pragmatic approach to enhancing public health while also benefiting the economy. Ultimately, prioritizing prevention holds great promise for a healthier future."
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;"The debate surrounding whether university education should be restricted to only the best academic students has gained considerable traction in recent years. Proponents of such a restriction argue that limiting access to high-achieving individuals ensures that limited educational resources are utilized effectively, fostering an environment of intellectual excellence. While there is merit in this viewpoint, I contend that university should remain accessible to a broader range of young people for several compelling reasons.Firstly, it is undeniable that outstanding academic students possess intellectual advantages that enable them to excel in traditional educational environments. Their performance reflects a mastery of subjects that can contribute significantly to the academic reputation of the institution. However, university education transcends pure academic achievement; it serves as a platform for students to explore various fields, including arts and humanities, where individuals with different talents may shine. Artistic aptitude, for instance, is as valuable as academic prowess and warrants recognition. By restricting access to only the top scholars, we risk stifling creativity and depriving society of diverse talents that contribute to cultural enrichment.Moreover, university is not solely about acquiring knowledge; it is also a crucial environment for developing vital soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and critical thinking. These skills are essential for success in today’s workforce and broader society. Students from varying academic backgrounds bring unique perspectives and experiences that can enhance the learning environment, creating a more dynamic and enriched educational experience.In conclusion, while restricting university access to the elite academic performers has its advantages, such as maintaining high academic standards, the broader implications of inclusivity are equally significant. A diverse university community fosters not only a range of skills and creativity but also prepares students for real-world challenges. Therefore, I largely disagree with the notion of limiting university education to only the best academic students."
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;"The statement that ""parents are the best teachers"" invites varying perspectives, primarily rooted in the roles both parents and educators play in a child's development. While parents undeniably have a profound influence on their children, I contend that teachers are often the better option for children's education in certain crucial aspects.First, the classroom environment provided by teachers is specifically designed for education. Teachers are professionally trained to deliver curricula, understand different learning styles, and employ effective teaching strategies. For instance, they have the skills necessary to explain complex subjects like mathematics or science in ways that captivate young minds and encourage critical thinking. In contrast, while parents may impart essential life skills and values, they might lack the specialized pedagogical knowledge required to teach academic subjects effectively.Furthermore, teachers serve as impartial figures in a child's life. In the classroom, children are more likely to embrace new ideas and viewpoints presented by a teacher, as they often view them as authority figures dedicated to their learning. This objectivity can foster a sense of respect and motivation that may sometimes be difficult to achieve within the familial context. For example, a teacher's feedback can provide children with different perspectives on their strengths and weaknesses, which can be pivotal in shaping their self-esteem and academic performance.Lastly, the social dimension of learning in a school environment plays a crucial role. Children interact with their peers and learn vital social skills from teachers that are essential for their future. This exposure to diverse perspectives and ideas broadens their understanding of the world, something that is often limited in the family unit.In conclusion, while parents are invaluable in providing foundational life lessons, I believe that teachers offer distinct advantages in formal education. Their specialized skills, objectivity, and facilitation of social learning create an environment that significantly enhances children's overall educational experiences."
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;When choosing a job, salary often emerges as a central focus for many individuals, primarily due to its direct impact on their financial stability and quality of life. It is undeniable that in today's society, where the cost of living is rising and job insecurity looms large, a competitive salary plays a crucial role in job selection. A substantial income can provide individuals with the means to meet their basic needs, support their families, and save for the future. The importance of financial security in today’s consumer-oriented world cannot be overstated.However, I believe that while salary is a significant consideration, it is not the sole factor that should influence career choices. Various other elements play an equally vital role in fostering job satisfaction and personal fulfillment. For instance, job enjoyment, work-life balance, and opportunities for professional growth contribute significantly to an individual's overall happiness and well-being. A high-paying job that leads to stress, burnout, or lack of fulfillment may ultimately prove detrimental, outweighing its financial advantages.Moreover, workplace culture and environment significantly affect one’s experience and satisfaction in a role. Employees who feel valued, supported, and part of a positive team dynamic are likely to be more engaged and productive, regardless of whether their salaries are on the higher end of the spectrum. Additionally, for many individuals, pursuing a passion or cause can bring intrinsic rewards that monetary compensation cannot match. Careers in education, healthcare, and nonprofit sectors, for example, might offer lower salaries, but the sense of purpose and contribution to society can be profoundly rewarding.In conclusion, while salary is undeniably an essential component when choosing a job, it should not overshadow other critical factors that contribute to personal satisfaction and a fulfilling career. Balancing income with other aspects of work life is key to finding not only a job but a rewarding career.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;"The argument for increasing taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage the use of private cars is one fraught with complexities and implications that extend beyond environmental concerns. While it is undeniable that the burning of oil for transportation significantly contributes to environmental degradation, rising fuel taxes can also have adverse effects on the economy and social equity.Cars have exerted severe pressure on the environment, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to climate change. The reliance on fossil fuels results in wasteful oil consumption, which not only depletes natural resources but also affects air quality in urban areas, imposing health risks on communities. However, the repercussions of high fuel taxes extend into the economic sphere, where the costs of transportation inevitably increase for everyone. The more costly petrol becomes, the higher the prices of essential goods like rice, meat, and vegetables — all of which rely on transportation for distribution. This burden disproportionately impacts low-income families who may already face financial constraints.Moreover, many countries import oil, and higher taxation can exacerbate their dependency on international oil exporters. This dependency creates political and financial vulnerabilities; nations may find themselves subject to the whims of oil-producing countries, which can manipulate prices or restrict supplies. Such scenarios could lead to economic instability and reduced national autonomy, complicating the very goals of sustainability and self-sufficiency we aim to achieve through reducing oil consumption.In conclusion, while the intent behind high fuel taxation to curb private car usage is laudable, the broader implications warrant careful consideration. Alternative solutions, like investing in public transportation, promoting electric vehicles, and encouraging carpooling, could achieve environmental goals without imposing undue hardships on consumers and the economy. Thus, a more balanced approach is essential to foster sustainable progress while safeguarding economic stability."
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;The debate surrounding the arming of police forces has intensified, particularly in light of rising street crime rates, which have become a significant concern for contemporary society. While some individuals argue that the presence of firearms among police officers escalates violence within communities, I contend that this perspective overlooks several critical factors.To begin with, one cannot ignore the reality that in many urban areas, the prevalence of violent crime necessitates a robust response from law enforcement. Armed criminals operate with a certain level of confidence and aggression, which puts both citizens and police at considerable risk. In response, equipping police officers with firearms is seen as a protective measure designed to ensure their safety as they confront armed offenders. Without the means to effectively defend themselves, police forces may find it increasingly challenging to uphold law and order.Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the potential consequences of an armed police force. Critics argue that the visibility of firearms may contribute to a culture of fear and aggression, leading to an increase in violent confrontations between police and civilians. Instances of excessive force can further erode public trust, creating a cycle of violence that is detrimental to community relationships. Moreover, the idea of guns being a deterrent against crime is contested. Research shows that in less armed societies, higher levels of community trust and cooperation exist, potentially resulting in lower crime rates. In this light, a heavily armed police force may not necessarily be the solution to violence but could potentially exacerbate the problem.In conclusion, while the rising number of street criminals justifies the need for an armed police force, it is imperative to consider the broader implications of this trend. The balance between public safety and maintaining community trust is delicate, and addressing underlying societal issues may ultimately lead to a safer environment without further escalating violence.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;In today’s educational landscape, the role of technology is undeniable, and I firmly agree that it enables students to learn more information and do so more quickly. The explosion of digital resources and tools has transformed the way we approach learning, creating opportunities that were previously unimaginable.Firstly, the richness of technology has made vast amounts of information easily accessible. With just a few clicks, students can access scholarly articles, instructional videos, e-books, and online courses that cater to diverse learning needs and styles. For instance, platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera provide comprehensive materials on a wide range of subjects, allowing students to delve deeper into topics beyond their standard curriculum. This wealth of information fosters a culture of self-directed learning, where students can explore their interests and gain knowledge at their own pace.Moreover, the convenience of technology plays a significant role in enhancing educational experiences. Online learning environments, such as virtual classrooms and discussion forums, enable students to collaborate with peers and educators from around the globe. This interaction not only broadens their perspectives but also accelerates their learning process. For example, a student wrestling with a challenging concept can easily seek help from online forums or study groups, receiving instant feedback and guidance. This immediacy contrasts starkly with traditional educational modalities, where access to support could be delayed.In conclusion, the advantages of technology in education are clear. The richness of available resources combined with the convenience of modern tools equips students with the capabilities to learn more information and do so rapidly. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential that educators and institutions leverage these innovations to further enhance learning outcomes, ultimately preparing students for success in an increasingly complex world.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;In the past century, humanity has witnessed an unprecedented technological revolution, reshaping virtually every aspect of our lives. While some individuals argue that this progress comes with significant negative consequences, I personally disagree with this perspective. I believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks, and the advancements we have made enhance our lives in numerous ways.Critics of technological development often point to issues such as increased screen time, social isolation, and the erosion of traditional jobs as significant drawbacks. They argue that reliance on technology has led to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and a growing mental health crisis among younger generations. Additionally, the automation of various industries can displace workers, leading to economic insecurity and widening income inequality.However, it is essential to consider the multifaceted benefits that technology has introduced. For instance, communication has become instantaneous and global. Platforms like social media, video conferencing, and messaging apps have bridged distances, allowing families and friends to stay connected regardless of geographical barriers. This connectivity fosters a sense of belonging and community, enabling collaboration and support networks that were once difficult to maintain.Moreover, advancements in medicine and healthcare technology have vastly improved life expectancy and quality of life. Innovations such as telemedicine, robotic surgeries, and AI-driven diagnostics allow for more accurate and timely medical interventions, benefiting millions worldwide. Additionally, technology has streamlined processes in various sectors, increasing efficiency and productivity, which ultimately contributes to economic growth.In conclusion, while concerns regarding the negative impacts of technological progress are valid, I maintain that these drawbacks are outweighed by the countless advantages technology brings. Our ability to connect, innovate, and improve our health and productivity demonstrates that, rather than diminishing our lives, technological advancement empowers us to lead richer, more connected lives.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";The prevalence of violence in television programs has become a pressing concern, particularly in the context of children's viewing habits. I strongly agree that there should be a concerted effort to reduce the amount of violence presented in televised content. The formative years of childhood, characterized by mental immaturity, make young audiences particularly vulnerable to the violent themes often depicted on screen. Given their limited ability to distinguish between right and wrong, children who are exposed to violent content may develop desensitization towards aggressive behavior or even adopt such behaviors in their interactions with peers.To tackle this issue more effectively, I advocate for strict governmental regulations prohibiting any forms of violent content in children’s television programs. By creating a safer viewing environment, we can help cultivate healthier attitudes toward conflict resolution and emotional expression among young audiences. While it is essential to shield children from harmful influence, such regulations must be balanced with respect for adult civil liberties. Adults, as mature individuals, are capable of making informed choices about their viewing preferences, and overly stringent regulations might infringe upon their rights to consume content intended for mature audiences.Nevertheless, it remains vital for society to acknowledge the significant impact of violent media on children's development. A collaborative approach that involves parents, educators, and policymakers can significantly mitigate exposure to violence in children's programming while preserving the freedom of adults to choose their entertainment. This balance ensures that children's mental and emotional well-being is prioritized without encroaching on the rights of adult viewers. Ultimately, reducing violent content in television can foster a more compassionate society, instilling values of empathy, respect, and conflict resolution in the next generation.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The debate surrounding whether armed police forces contribute to higher levels of violence in society is complex and multifaceted. Some individuals argue that the presence of firearms among police officers escalates tensions and encourages violent confrontations. They assert that when law enforcement is heavily armed, it may inadvertently normalize the use of guns in society, leading to an increase in violence. However, I tend to disagree with this perspective, believing that while the presence of guns does play a role, there are more significant factors contributing to the rising rates of criminality observed globally.First and foremost, the increase in crime rates can often be linked to socio-economic issues such as poverty, lack of education, and unemployment. Communities facing economic hardships may experience higher levels of desperation, leading some individuals to resort to criminal behavior as a means of survival. In such cases, the presence of armed police is merely a response to an already existing problem rather than a cause of increased violence.Furthermore, the relationship between a police force's armament and societal violence is not straightforward. In regions where policing is perceived as fair and just, armed officers can serve as a deterrent to crime. For instance, the existence of a well-trained police force equipped with firearms may discourage potential criminals who are aware that law enforcement is capable of effectively responding to violent situations.Additionally, it is crucial to acknowledge the role of community engagement in policing strategies. When police forces build trust and establish strong ties with the communities they serve, they foster a sense of safety and cooperation. This partnership can diminish the likelihood of violent confrontations, regardless of whether police are armed or not.In conclusion, while the presence of guns among police may influence the dynamics of violence in society, it is vital to consider the broader socio-economic and community factors at play. Addressing the root causes of crime and fostering positive relationships between law enforcement and communities can lead to a more significant reduction in violence, regardless of whether officers are armed.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";When considering the influences on a child's success in school, the role of classmates often surpasses that of parents. I firmly believe that classmates are a more significant influence due to their ability to create a competitive atmosphere that motivates individual achievements.Firstly, the presence of peers fosters a sense of competition. In the classroom, students observe and compare their abilities with those of their classmates. This competition can incent children to strive for better grades, engage more in discussions, and seek help when needed. For instance, a student who sees their classmates succeeding in a particular subject may feel compelled to study harder and improve their performance. This dynamic not only encourages academic success but also cultivates a spirit of perseverance and resilience among students.Moreover, from a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to peers can exert tremendous pressure on children, ultimately influencing their academic performances. If a child finds themselves consistently lagging behind their classmates, they may experience anxiety or a fear of failure that can negatively impact their self-esteem and motivation. In contrast, when they identify with high-achieving peers, there is a natural inclination to emulate their work ethic and dedication, thereby raising their own academic standards. Another aspect of this influence is the social learning that occurs among classmates. Children often adopt behaviors, attitudes, and habits of those around them, which can either propel them toward academic excellence or lead them astray. Groups that value education foster attitudes that prioritize learning and achievement, making the collective influence of classmates pivotal in shaping individual academic journeys.In conclusion, while parents undoubtedly play a crucial role in a child's development and can provide foundational support, classmates uniquely create an environment that consistently motivates and challenges students. The competitive atmosphere they cultivate, along with the psychological dynamics at play, positions classmates as the most critical influence on a child's success in school.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;The trend of urbanization is a defining characteristic of our era, with an increasing number of people gravitating towards big cities in search of better opportunities and lifestyles. While living in these bustling metropolises offers conveniences and modern amenities, it is important to consider the adverse effects this lifestyle can have on people's health. I largely agree that living in big cities can be detrimental to overall well-being, primarily due to environmental pollution and the stressors associated with urban life.One of the most pressing issues in large urban centers is the prevalence of air and noise pollution. Cities are often choked with vehicles, industrial emissions, and construction activities that significantly degrade air quality. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is responsible for millions of premature deaths worldwide, leading to respiratory diseases and cardiovascular problems. Increased levels of noise pollution further exacerbate these health risks, causing sleep disturbances, heightened stress levels, and a range of psychological issues.Moreover, the urban lifestyle can contribute to unhealthy living habits. The fast-paced nature of city life often encourages quick meals—typically fast food options—over home-cooked healthier alternatives. Consequently, urban residents may face rising obesity rates and related diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Social isolation is another concern in cities that are teeming with people. Despite being surrounded by vast numbers of individuals, city dwellers can experience feelings of loneliness and anxiety, which can have grave impacts on mental health.In conclusion, while big cities can offer a wealth of opportunities and conveniences, the environmental and health implications cannot be overlooked. Issues like pollution, unhealthy lifestyle choices, and social isolation present significant challenges that can lead to deteriorating health among urban populations. As such, it is essential for city planners and residents alike to prioritize sustainable practices and holistic well-being to mitigate these adverse effects.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;The debate surrounding the arming of police forces is a contentious one, with some asserting that the presence of firearms among law enforcement can escalate societal violence. While it is understandable to hold such concerns, I largely disagree with the notion that arming police inevitably leads to increased violence.Proponents of disarming police often point to instances where armed confrontations between law enforcement and civilians have resulted in tragic outcomes, thus perpetuating societal fear and resistance toward the police. They argue that when officers carry guns, it might foster a culture of aggression rather than one of protection. However, it is essential to recognize that most violent crimes involving firearms are predominantly committed with guns obtained illegally. This indicates that the issue of gun violence is more deeply rooted in the availability and illegal possession of firearms than in law enforcement practices.Furthermore, if a government aims to effectively control crime within a community, it should focus on managing the behaviors and actions of its populace rather than solely restricting the weapons used by its police force. Effective crime prevention requires a comprehensive approach encompassing social, economic, and educational initiatives that target the underlying causes of violence. Enhancing community engagement, improving mental health resources, and fostering trust between law enforcement and citizens can mitigate tensions and reduce overall crime rates.In conclusion, while concerns about the arming of police forces are valid, the presence of firearms among law enforcement should not be viewed as the primary catalyst for societal violence. The real challenge lies in addressing the root causes of crime and ensuring that police departments are equipped not only with firearms but also with the necessary tools for de-escalation and community connection.
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;Education is widely regarded as a pivotal factor in the overall development of a country, and I wholeheartedly agree with this assertion. Particularly in developing nations, the challenges surrounding education are profound. Many families are unable to afford the costs associated with sending their children to school, whether due to tuition fees, transportation, or the need for children to contribute to household income. This lack of access results in a cycle of poverty that can be difficult to break, stifling the potential of entire communities and hindering national progress.However, development through education does not exclusively mean shaping a workforce filled with doctors, lawyers, or engineers. While these professions are essential, education's true value lies in its ability to transform individuals into well-informed citizens capable of making sound judgments. An educated person can be an effective leader, a responsible consumer, and a community advocate, influencing societal norms and ethical standards. This kind of enlightenment fosters innovation, enhances civic engagement, and promotes critical thinking – all of which are crucial for a country striving for advancement.Moreover, education contributes to social cohesion and empowerment. It encourages individuals to participate actively in their communities, understand their rights, and advocate for changes that benefit not only themselves but also their neighbors. Thus, even basic education can yield substantial benefits, leading to improved public health, increased economic productivity, and enhanced social stability.In conclusion, while the economic hurdles in developing countries may pose significant challenges, investing in education is paramount for national development. It cultivates a populace that is not only skilled but also informed and engaged, capable of driving progress from the grassroots level to national policy. Hence, education stands as the cornerstone of any meaningful development agenda.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";"The assertion that celebrities are more renowned for their glamour and wealth than for their actual achievements is a topic of much debate. While there is validity in the claim that some individuals gain fame predominantly through their luxurious lifestyles, it is essential to examine the broader context of how this phenomenon influences young people.Many argue that adolescents are negatively influenced by celebrities who lack substantial talents, but instead showcase extravagant lifestyles. Figures from reality television or social media often become infamous for their wealth and glamorous lives, leading impressionable youth to idolize a superficial standard of success. This shift in focus might detract from the admiration of genuine talent and dedication found in traditional role models, such as athletes, scientists, or artists. However, it is imperative to recognize that the younger generation is increasingly aware of the complexities surrounding fame. Today's youth are more educated and have access to a wealth of information that enables them to differentiate between mere celebrity status and genuine achievement. Many young people prioritize authenticity and are drawn to figures who use their platform for social change, philanthropy, or advocacy. Additionally, with the proliferation of digital tools and life skills education, it has become more challenging for untalented individuals to maintain their status solely on wealth and glamour.Moreover, it is worth noting that the celebrity ecosystem is not solely populated by individuals without talent; many personalities leverage their initial achievements to sustain their fame. For instance, successful actors, musicians, or entrepreneurs often utilize their influence for positive causes, thereby setting examples of dedicated work and success for young audiences.In conclusion, while it is true that some celebrities garner attention for their wealth and glamor, young people today are increasingly discerning. They are more equipped to seek inspiration from those who demonstrate talent and contribute positively to society. Ultimately, the potential influence of celebrity culture depends on the values that the younger generation chooses to embrace, which indicates a promising outlook for the future."
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;In the 21st century, mobile phones have become ubiquitous, embraced by people of all ages and backgrounds. While they serve as remarkable tools for communication, information access, and entertainment, I firmly believe that their extensive use can significantly undermine genuine social interaction. One of the most pressing issues with mobile phones is that they encourage users to engage in virtual interactions rather than face-to-face communication. Many individuals find themselves engrossed in their devices even when in the company of others, resulting in a noticeable decline in meaningful conversations. This preoccupation with screens diminishes our capacity for empathy and connection, as non-verbal cues critical to understanding emotional context are often overlooked. As people immerse themselves in digital exchanges, they may lose the ability to navigate the nuances of real-life social interactions, ultimately eroding their social skills.Moreover, the pervasive use of mobile phones can lead to a sense of isolation. While we may be technically “connected” through social media and messaging apps, these interactions often lack the depth and authenticity of direct engagement. Increasingly, individuals report feelings of loneliness despite their online presence. This paradox highlights how screens can create barriers rather than bridges, fostering a superficial sense of belonging while neglecting the enriching experience of physical presence and shared emotional moments.Additionally, excessive reliance on mobile phones can deter young people from developing critical interpersonal skills. The art of conversation, active listening, and observing social cues are all jeopardized when interactions are mediated through a screen. As they grow up, these individuals may struggle to form genuine relationships, impacting their personal and professional lives.In conclusion, while mobile phones have transformed communication in unprecedented ways, I contend that their overuse contributes significantly to the deterioration of social interaction. By prioritizing our devices over direct contact, we risk compromising our social skills and the rich, profound relationships that define the human experience.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;The assertion that only governments and large companies bear the responsibility for mitigating environmental issues overlooks the potential contributions ordinary individuals can make. While it is true that addressing significant environmental problems often requires substantial financial resources and advanced technologies—assets typically controlled by governments and corporations—laypersons also have a pivotal role to play.On one hand, the argument for the responsibility of governments and large companies is compelling. Large-scale environmental issues, such as climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss, necessitate coordinated global efforts and significant funding, often beyond the capacity of individuals. Government policies and regulations can drive systemic changes, while corporations possess the technological prowess and capital to innovate and implement renewable energy solutions, sustainable practices, and pollution controls. Without robust governmental frameworks and the commitment of large businesses, progress in addressing such complex environmental challenges could be severely hindered.However, dismissing the potential of ordinary citizens to contribute to environmental protection would be a grave oversight. Individuals can engage in a variety of actions that collectively have a meaningful impact. By adopting sustainable practices—like recycling, reducing waste, and conserving energy—ordinary people can help reduce their carbon footprints. Additionally, grassroots movements and community initiatives foster awareness and drive collective action, influencing policies that reflect the will of the populace. Moreover, when individuals participate in environmental conservation efforts, they not only contribute positively to their surroundings but also benefit from improved health, aesthetic beauty, and quality of life.In conclusion, while governments and corporations undeniably have a crucial role in environmental reform, the involvement of ordinary people should not be underestimated. Embracing a dual approach—wherein both the macro-level actions of powerful entities and the micro-level efforts of individuals work in concert—will be vital for fostering a sustainable future. Both spheres of responsibility are intertwined and essential to achieving lasting change.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;The portrayal of crime in newspapers and on television has become a pivotal concern in contemporary society. There is a growing argument that the detailed and often sensationalized coverage of criminal activities should be restricted, given the detrimental consequences it can yield. I mostly agree with this viewpoint, as extensive crime reporting can perpetuate fear and desensitize communities while also providing potential criminals with information that can be harmful.First and foremost, a significant portion of crime coverage is frequently biased and exaggerated. Media outlets often prioritize sensational stories that captivate audiences, rather than presenting a balanced view of crime in society. As a result, communities become inundated with frightening headlines that paint an unrealistic picture of danger, exacerbating the anxiety and paranoia among law-abiding citizens. When people are bombarded with news of violent crimes, they may feel like they are constantly at risk, leading to a community paralyzed by fear rather than fostering a sense of safety.Moreover, detailed reports of crimes can serve as encouraging instructional materials for potential offenders. Criminals could glean techniques and methods from media portrayals that they might not easily access otherwise. This phenomenon not only validates their intentions but can also lead to an increase in imitation crimes and copycat behavior, worsening the prevalence of unlawful activities in society.Finally, the lack of restrictions on crime reporting can contribute to a breakdown of social harmony. The constant focus on criminal activities can overshadow the narratives of community strength and resilience. It may exacerbate divisions among communities, as fear-driven narratives bolster prejudices and stigmas, further fracturing societal bonds.In conclusion, while it is crucial to inform the public about crime, the manner in which these details are disseminated bears significant consequences. Therefore, I believe that media coverage should be moderated to mitigate unnecessary fear, reduce biased portrayals, and prevent the potential glorification or inspiration for criminal behavior.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;"In today's digital age, where technology permeates every aspect of our lives, the necessity of teaching handwriting to children has become a topic of debate. While some argue that the convenience of typing and digital communication renders handwriting unnecessary, I firmly believe that teaching handwriting remains crucial for several reasons.Firstly, despite the prevalence of modern technology, handwriting is an essential skill that fosters cognitive development. The act of writing by hand engages different parts of the brain, enhancing memory retention and comprehension. Research has shown that students who take notes by hand tend to perform better academically than those who rely solely on laptops or tablets. This cognitive connection between writing and learning is fundamental and cannot be replicated by simply typing on a keyboard.Moreover, poor handwriting can have a significant negative impact on a student's overall academic performance. Legibility is vital; if a student's work cannot be easily read, it can lead to misunderstandings or the invalidation of their ideas. Teachers often struggle to decipher poorly written assignments, which may unfairly affect grading. Thus, good handwriting not only reflects the ability to communicate effectively but also plays a vital role in a student's confidence and self-esteem in the academic environment.While the tools of communication are evolving, we should not underestimate the importance of handwriting. It is not merely a relic of the past but a foundational skill that supports learning and personal expression. Encouraging children to master handwriting equips them with an irreplaceable tool for their educational journey and beyond. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the inclusion of handwriting instruction in modern education, recognizing its vital role alongside emerging technologies."
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";The debate over whether families who send their children to private schools should be exempt from taxes that support the state education system is a contentious one. Proponents of tax exemption for these families argue that the taxes they pay for public education are unreasonable, especially since they are already funding their children's education at private institutions. They feel that they are unfairly contributing to a system they do not use, which can lead to frustration and resentment.However, it is crucial to acknowledge that by paying taxes for state education, affluent families contribute to narrowing the gap between rich and poor. Public education serves as a critical vehicle for social mobility, providing opportunities to children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. When wealthier families choose to invest in private education, they still play a pivotal role in supporting the public system, which benefits the collective society. If the tax burden were lifted for these families, there would likely be a significant decrease in funding for public schools, thereby harming those who rely on the public education system most.Moreover, the proposal for tax reductions for parents with children studying in private schools could lead to a waste of public capital. This could inadvertently encourage a shift in public funding towards private education preferences rather than enhancing the quality of public schools. Resources that could have been utilized to improve public education infrastructure or hire more qualified educators may instead be diverted or diminished, thereby exacerbating existing disparities.In conclusion, while concerns regarding tax contributions for state education are understandable, exempting families with children in private schools from these taxes could have serious negative implications for public education and social equity. It is essential to find a balance that recognizes the contributions of private school families while still prioritizing the overall health and accessibility of the public education system.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;"The debate surrounding government investment in the arts versus public services like healthcare and education has been a contentious issue. Many argue that funding the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of taxpayer money when more pressing needs exist in public services. While I acknowledge the significance of robust investments in essential services, I contend that both public services and the arts are worthy of financial support.It is undeniable that health and education are paramount to the well-being of a society. Public services like hospitals and schools require substantial investment to function efficiently and to ensure that citizens receive the quality care and education they deserve. Access to medical facilities and quality education are essential in fostering a healthy and knowledgeable populace. In this light, prioritizing funding for these areas is crucial; every penny spent on public services is an investment in a society's future.However, dismissing the arts as a luxury or an unworthy expenditure overlooks their profound impact on cultural identity, mental well-being, and community cohesion. The arts enrich our lives, providing a means for expression, encouraging creativity, and fostering a sense of belonging. They often serve as a catalyst for economic growth, tourism, and job creation. Music and theatre can bring communities together, facilitate dialogue, and address social issues, thus playing a crucial role in societal progress.In conclusion, while I recognize the pressing need for government investment in essential public services, I maintain that cutting funding for the arts is not the solution. Instead, a balanced approach that allocates resources to both public services and the arts is essential, as both sectors contribute uniquely to the fabric of society. Investment in the arts should complement, not compete with, funding for public services, ensuring a richer, more vibrant society for all."
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;The impact of technology on traditional cultures is a complex and contentious issue. Many argue that as technology advances, traditional cultures inevitably face decline, leading to the loss of age-old customs, languages, and practices. The proliferation of global communication platforms, social media, and modern entertainment tools often overshadow traditional methods of cultural expression. For instance, with the rise of digital media, local storytelling practices have diminished, as many individuals prefer consuming streamlined content from global networks over engaging with their cultural narratives. Additionally, the allure of urbanization and modern conveniences often leads rural populations to abandon traditional lifestyles in favor of more contemporary existences, resulting in a disconnection from cultural roots.However, it is essential to acknowledge that technology also plays a crucial role in preserving and studying traditional cultures. For instance, digital archiving has made it possible to record and share endangered languages and cultural practices that were on the verge of vanishing. Online platforms enable diverse groups to connect, fostering cultural exchange and the revival of interest in traditional practices. Social media campaigns have successfully raised awareness about indigenous rights and cultural preservation, empowering communities to promote their heritage in the digital sphere.Additionally, technological advancements in research and documentation have provided scholars with better tools to study and analyze traditional cultures. Virtual reality, for example, can recreate cultural experiences, allowing individuals to immerse themselves in the histories of various traditions without physical geographical constraints. In conclusion, while it is undeniable that the advancement of technology poses threats to traditional cultures, it also presents unique opportunities for preservation and revitalization. The interplay between these two forces suggests that a harmonious coexistence, rather than an inevitable loss, is possible if approached thoughtfully.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;The proposition that universities should enforce equal enrollment of male and female students across all subjects stirs a significant debate about gender representation in higher education. Advocates argue that this approach promotes fairness and equality, ensuring that both genders have equal opportunities in all fields. However, I contend that while increasing gender balance is important, imposing strict quotas could undermine the diversity of interests that inherently drive students towards different disciplines.It is noteworthy that societal trends often influence the preferences of students. Traditionally, boys have gravitated towards fields such as science and technology, while girls have shown a marked inclination towards literature, education, and the arts. This division reflects not only cultural norms but also the differing interests that arise from individual experiences and societal expectations. While it is crucial that universities strive to foster inclusivity and balance, mandating equal numbers in every faculty could distort the organic nature of students' academic choices.Rather than enforcing quotas, universities should actively encourage female participation in science and technology while simultaneously stimulating male interest in humanities and arts. Initiatives like workshops, mentorship programs, and exposure to role models can play a vital role in breaking the stereotypes associated with gender and academic pursuit. For instance, showcasing successful women in STEM fields can inspire more girls to consider these subjects, while promoting the value of humanities can attract boys who may otherwise overlook these disciplines.Ultimately, while the goal of achieving gender parity in higher education is commendable, a more nuanced approach that respects individual interests is crucial. By encouraging students to follow their passions rather than conform to arbitrary quotas, we can cultivate a genuinely diverse academic environment that benefits everyone.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;"Media coverage of celebrities has become ubiquitous in modern society, and its implications on children are often concerning. Many individuals argue that the incessant focus on the lavish lifestyles of movie stars and other public figures generates unrealistic expectations and ideals among the younger population. I tend to agree with this viewpoint, as the portrayal of celebrities in media can lead to detrimental effects on children's perceptions of success and the value of hard work.When children are bombarded with images of celebrities living opulent lives—complete with luxury cars, extravagant homes, and seemingly endless parties—they may draw the conclusion that financial success and happiness are easily attainable without significant effort. For example, children may idolize a pop star or an athlete, fixating on their glamorous lifestyle while overlooking the years of hard work and dedication that often accompany such achievements. This phenomenon creates a dangerous narrative; children might feel disillusioned about the importance of education and perseverance, believing instead that fame and fortune are accessible through mere luck or appearance.Moreover, not all celebrities serve as positive role models. An increasing number of public figures engage in controversial behavior, from substance abuse to public scandals, which can send mixed messages to impressionable young audiences. Children may confuse notoriety with respectability, failing to distinguish between admirable traits and those that are merely sensationalized. In conclusion, while celebrity culture has its appeal, the predominantly positive representation in media can obscure important truths about the value of hard work and the complexity of real-life success. It is crucial for parents and educators to counterbalance media messages with discussions about dedication, ethics, and the reality of achieving one's dreams. By fostering a more nuanced understanding of achievement, we can help guide children towards healthier aspirations that prioritize effort and integrity over superficial glamour."
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The adage ""prevention is better than cure"" resonates profoundly in contemporary discussions surrounding healthcare policy. In today’s world, the concept of the welfare state necessitates that governments ensure the provision of sustainable healthcare and health education for their citizens. As healthcare systems grapple with the growing burden of chronic diseases and the escalating costs associated with treatments, it becomes critical to reconsider how health budgets are allocated.Investing in preventive measures and health education can lead to significant societal benefits. Health education plays an essential role in equipping individuals with the knowledge needed to make informed lifestyle choices. By addressing prevalent issues such as obesity, smoking, and sedentary behavior through educational programs, governments can mitigate the risks of chronic conditions, which often require extensive and expensive treatments. Additionally, preventative services such as vaccinations and regular screenings can detect ailments early, minimizing the necessity for complex medical interventions down the line.Furthermore, a focus on prevention aligns with the principles of equity and access that underpin welfare states. When health education and preventive services are prioritized, they become accessible to all, ultimately fostering a healthier population. This proactive approach not only enhances individual well-being but reduces the overall financial strain on the healthcare system. Countries that have successfully implemented these strategies, such as Sweden and Finland, demonstrate lower long-term healthcare costs and improved health outcomes.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly agree that a larger proportion of a country’s health budget should be diverted from treatment to invest in health education and preventive measures. By doing so, governments can create a sustainable healthcare system that prioritizes the well-being of citizens, reduces future health expenditures, and fosters a culture of health consciousness—ultimately realizing the full potential of the welfare state."
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood, as the dynamics of modern family life demonstrate the importance of both parents in raising children. In today’s world, the challenges of having and nurturing a child can be daunting. Economic pressures, work-life balance, and the increasing complexity of social environments mean that both parents must actively participate in the upbringing of their children. While the mother’s role is undeniably critical in a child's life, I strongly agree that fatherhood is equally essential to healthy parenting.First and foremost, both parents contribute distinct strengths that together foster balanced development in children. Mothers often provide emotional support and nurturing, whereas fathers may contribute a sense of adventure and discipline. Research shows that children with actively involved fathers tend to excel academically, socially, and emotionally. A father’s involvement often leads to improved self-esteem and resilience in children. This highlights the fact that both maternal and paternal influences are vital in shaping a well-rounded individual.Additionally, the notion that women are solely responsible for child-rearing is an outdated stereotype that perpetuates gender inequality. It places undue pressure on mothers and undermines the importance of fathers in family life. As society progresses towards more egalitarian norms, it is crucial to challenge these archaic beliefs by acknowledging that parenting, as a partnership between both mother and father, is essential. In my view, the role models within a family, encompassing both mothers and fathers, play a significant role in the overall development of a child. Children learn from their parents and observe how each parent handles responsibilities, relationships, and conflicts. By emphasizing fatherhood as equally important as motherhood, we cultivate a well-rounded family structure, ultimately benefitting future generations. Thus, advocating for the visibility and involvement of fathers is essential for the healthy development of both children and society.
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.;The assertion that children should prioritize studying hard at school while dismissing time spent playing sports as wasted is a narrow perspective that undervalues the multifaceted development of young individuals. Both studying and playing sports are integral aspects of childhood that contribute to a child’s overall growth and future success.Studying hard at school undeniably equips children with essential knowledge and skills. Academic achievement lays the foundation for future educational and career opportunities, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and intellectual resilience. The insights gained from rigorous schooling prepare children for the complexities of adult life, creating informed citizens who can contribute thoughtfully to society.Conversely, the importance of playing sports cannot be understated. Physical activity is vital for children's health, promoting fitness, endurance, and coordination. Engaging in sports helps combat childhood obesity and instills lifelong habits of physical activity. Beyond physical health, sports teach valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and resilience. Children learn to set goals, work collaboratively, and handle both success and failure, which are vital experiences that inform their personal and social development.Moreover, the interplay between academics and sports can enhance overall well-being. Research indicates that children who participate in sports often experience improved concentration and better academic performance. Physical activity can serve as a stress reliever, allowing children to recharge their minds, ultimately benefiting their studies. In conclusion, both studying hard and playing sports are crucial components of a balanced childhood. Rather than viewing time spent on sports as wasted, it should be recognized as an investment in physical health, social skills, and emotional resilience. Emphasizing one over the other neglects the holistic development that children require to thrive in all aspects of life.
